But we do! ManBearPig is gonna kill everyone, and he's not gonna stop!  Nobody's coming for us, Stan. They think we're murderers. Mom?  Mr. Gore? Where have you been?! Yeah. Where have you been?! Well what happened to you? Are you dead or something? What, what?  I can't do this alone. I need help. What more do you want from me?? I've atoned for my mistake. I'm sorry that we were getting a lot of different information at the time. You know, even you were wrong about a lot of the things you said would happen a- Nothing. I didn't mean-  I am sorry, please! I'm cereal! Ah, I didn't mean to say you were wrong, just that some of your predictions didn't happen- Please, please, please!  I'll do anything! I just want everyone to be safe! Go where? Al Gore isn't dead. We shouldn't be out here. We're wanted by the police.  It's Satan. Work together how?? Credits?  Satan!  No. Satan, you can't die. If you can't stop ManBearPig, how can we be-?? Come back. Come back.   Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.  All right, looks like we're clear. This is the best place to hide. Where's the last place anyone would think we would hide? The scene of our supposed crime, dummies! We're safe here. Stan! How'd you find us here? Well, what's he want everyone to give up?
