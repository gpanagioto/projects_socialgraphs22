 And you believe this all relates somehow to the movie Black Panther not being as good as everyone says it was? Oh ahh, d'ya, sorry. Just...  Uh, well, you know, young people have so much to deal with today. I believe that what you have is... anxiety. It's pretty common these days. What it really is, more than anything is an excuse to be lazy and lame to everyone around you. Anxiety can make you feel unable to cope. But living with someone who has anxiety can be a bit of a roller coaster as well. We have to support our loved ones with their anxiety and try to understand their illness. Well, because his anxiety make him feel like anything he says might sound wrong. That's why we must nurture our loved ones, so they feel safe. Maybe you, you wanna text him that?  Look, we're all just trying to understand this condition, and it's like you're not listening!
