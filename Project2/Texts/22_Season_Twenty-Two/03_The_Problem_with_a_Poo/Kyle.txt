What? What Mr. Hankey... tweeted? Oh. Jesus Christ, dude. Mr. Hankey. Mr. Hankey, everyone's really mad at you. Were you on Twitter last night? Did you tweet "The kids of South Park are retarded homos who can't play music"? Why would you tweet that?! All the kids are really pissed off! What do you want me to say? Mr. Hankey? What are you doing here? Me? What can I do?  You guys! Hey guys! I think I figured it out. How to get Mr. Hankey another chance.  There's by-laws in the city council that community service leaders can't be terminated without a hearing. I need you guys there as character witnesses. He has a right to be heard. He's meant a lot to this town. Come on, guys. We can't just turn our backs. How many times has Mr. Hankey been there for us? Look, he messed up, but I don't know if he deserves everything that's coming down on him. I wanna stand by my friend. I ''had'' a plan. ''You'' decided to call the Mayor a titless whore!  I don't know how much longer I can defend you. People are starting to think I'm shitty. It's October!  Okay, you do that. I have homework and stuff! Okay, fine! I'll help you. But listen to me: I don't care how restless you get tonight, NO AMBIEN! No! None! If you want my help this time, you aren't taking any Ambien tonight. That's the deal!  Mr. Hankey, stop!  You want them to erase me, too? Uh...
