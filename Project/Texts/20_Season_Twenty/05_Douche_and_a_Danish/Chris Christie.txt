Ladies and gentlemen, out country's divided like never before. And we all know that only one man has the guts to say what we're all thinking. Please, welcome the man who with your help will soon be the next President of the United States!  We are way down in the polls. I don't know how we recover from this. A lot of us have staked our lives on backing you! You can't just go bonkers like this! You wanna tell them that? They're outside.   Mr. Garrison, you can't just act like nothing happened! You're spiraling out of control, and you have to answer to the people! 	Mr. Garrison. 	You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison, and you have to make good on it! Come on.  Get back here! You're acting like an idiot!
