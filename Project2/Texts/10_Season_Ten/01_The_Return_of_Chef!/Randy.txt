Good-bye, Chef! Have a good time at the Super Adventure Club! Oh, finally!  Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again? Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right? Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in. Yeah.
