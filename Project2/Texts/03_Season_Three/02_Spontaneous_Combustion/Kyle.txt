No, I don't think so. No, that's a hair dryer! Yeah. Do you have any "nurections"? I need to get a nurection for my dad. Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom. You bastards! Yeah.  Well, I'm Jewish. I guess not. Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs! We'll do it! We'll do it! Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan? He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend. This is gonna be fun. You're too fat to be Jesus! Stan should be Jesus. You're such a fat baby! All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby! Die! | I don't know you, dude. Hey, that went really well. They really liked it. Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds! Yeah. That looks pretty good. Yeah, me too. Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days. Then I can give it to my dad.  Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection. Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad. How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?! Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap!  We ''know'' how to fart, Mr. Mackey! Jesus Christ!  Dude, I think you pooed a lot. God, that was ''not'' cool at all, dude! Yeah. We're having him resurrurected. Sick! It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this. Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too. Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak. Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up!  She's not worried about you. How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I ''kick your ass''! Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.  Yeah, take that! ...Oh, yeah. Sorry. Dude, those people are pissed! Where's your dad? Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help ''my'' dad. Dude, that was ''Star Trek'' again. "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was ''Wrath of Khan.'' She's upstairs. Really? Great! I don't have to worry about ''that'' anymore.  Well, my dad is, too. I forgot all about him.  Wow! Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
