Hey, what the hell's going on? Mephesto's been shot. Then who was it? Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next. I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.  What?  Like sailors on a submarine.  Whew. Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling. I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...  Eat Eric Roberts! This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna ''die'' here, I ''know'' it. Oh! I can't... go on.  Ohh. It's over! We're free! Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some? Noo, that doesn't make sense! Uh-meaning what?
