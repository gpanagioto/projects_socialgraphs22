 Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right? We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?  Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do. It's not? Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas. Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office? Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O. You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model? Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans? Let me show you what I mean.
