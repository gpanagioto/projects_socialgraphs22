Am I a joke to you? I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke? You '''do''' have a Facebook page, Stan! Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single? You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends! And you'd '''better''' change your relationship status to "In a relationship"! By editing your profile under "basic information"! "I think you look cute in your bunny costume." "I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?! That's what Susan92 wrote on your Facebook wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you!
