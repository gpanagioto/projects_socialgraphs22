Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down. Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise. Perhaps we need a ''new'' icon for Christmas. Ex-cuse me? Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions? Yes, Mr. Garrison. No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans. Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group! Is anyone offended by mistletoe? Lose the mistletoe!
