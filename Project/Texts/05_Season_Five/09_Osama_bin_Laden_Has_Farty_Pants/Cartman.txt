...Not really. Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors. Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those? God-damnit!  HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads! Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at ''war'' with these assholes! That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault. Yes, but they're sand monkeys!  God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!! Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off. Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it. It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom. Oh no, not Towelie.  No, we don't wanna get high!! That's right!  Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?  Aw, son of a bitch!  Uh ho, you guys. It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting. Uh, whatever! Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while! God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist! What is this? The freakin' Flintstones? It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to ''your'' crappy country.  What did you call us?! I told you! Jawas have no heart. You know, sand people.  God, I hate you so much, Stan! Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you! Dude, don't call me a Canadian!  Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-  Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive. I'm gonna go take care of this prick! He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people.  Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden? Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh Uh oh! Mmm-mm!  Hey look! An infidel!  So ''that's'' what this is all about?  Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ''ass'' of a chicken! Woohoo!  Haduqaduqaduqa.  There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create!  Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling. Come on! The cameras are ready!  Yeah.
