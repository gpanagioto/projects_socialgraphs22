Look, there's ''more'' of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main. That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.  Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs! Yeah.  Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!   Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here! How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase "t"! Yeah, for "time to leave"! Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase "t"! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready! Alright!  T is for "time to leave," cashchucker! Now, come on! Is that any way to talk? No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything?  Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED! Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll ''spook'' 'em out! That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires! Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-
