A scrapbook shot of Butters sleeping, with a poo mustache on his face.

Cartman

This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha. [the caption reads "THE PIERRE 3/10/07." Cartman flips the page. The pages are artsy in design] And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth. [Yep, the tampon is in there like a thermometer] I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual". [the caption is shown, Cartman flips the page. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny stand around him, looking at the pictures. They're all in Cartman's room.] This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae". [caresses the picture] I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.

Kyle

Is this all you brought us here to see?

Cartman

Oh no, there's much more. [flips the page] Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it "New Moon Rising". [a shot of Cartman hanging his ass over Butters' face] I did a whole study using my ass. [Cartman's ass over Butters' face from the left side] Here it is using some high-contrast stuff. [next, Cartman wearing darker pajamas, mooning Butters] trying out some... different light filters here. [last shot looks faded, with Cartman's ass directly on Butters' face.] But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.

Kyle

Butters is staying over tonight?

Cartman

Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-

Butters

[appears at Cartman's bedroom door] Hey, fellas! [Stan and Kenny turn around. Kyle looks over his left shoulder]

Cartman

Heh! [quickly puts away his scrapbook] Oh, oh hey, Butters! [turns around and greets him] I wasn't expecting you so soon.

Butters

Yeah. [puts down his sleeping bag] I finished my chores so I came over a little early. [Cartman takes the sleeping bag and sets it aside. Butters notices the other guys] Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?

Cartman

[returns] No no, these guys were just leaving. [faces the other guys menacingly] Weren't you guys?

Stan

Come on, let's go. [leads Kyle and Kenny out the door.]

Kyle

[stops] Wait, wai- I can't let this happen. [turns around] Butters.

Butters

Yeah Kyle?

Kyle

Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?

Cartman

Kyyyle!

Butters

Uh what do you mean?

Kyle

I mean, that if-

Cartman

What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.

Butters

Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.

Kyle

[angered] Hrrugh! [leaves]

Butters

So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?

Cartman

Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.

Butters

But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.

Cartman

Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.

-----


South Park, morning. The boys walk up to the bus stop. Cartman isn't with them.

Cartman

[off screen] You guys! I got it! [runs in and joins them] It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!

Stan

What'cha do to Butters this time?

Cartman

It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! [cracks up at his own cleverness]

Kyle

Dude!

Cartman

I know I know, check it out, look. [the other three crowd in and look at the picture] I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!

Stan

Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?

Cartman

Because that makes Butters gay now!

Kyle

No dude, that makes you gay!

Cartman

Eh- ...what?

Kyle

You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!

Cartman

[looks more closely at the picture] Nuh uh.

Kyle

Yeah huh!

Cartman

Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?

Kenny

(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)

Cartman

But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!

Stan

You are now.

Cartman

No, no, it was a stupid mistake!

Kyle

Doesn't matter. You're gay now.

Cartman

No, it was just for a second! [seeing that his plan has backfired, he puts the picture away] What, what can I do? How-how can I reverse this?

Stan

You can't!

Kyle

No-no wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.

Cartman

How?

Kyle

The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.

Cartman

[low voice] Really?

Kyle

Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.

Cartman

[beat] ...Shit, I gotta find Butters! [runs off]

Kyle

[beat] ...Idiot.

-----


Butters' bedroom, several minutes later. Butters is playing with his toys - a car, a truck, and a small action figure.

Butters

[singing] Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... [continues howling the tune]

Cartman

[enters the room] Butters.

Butters

[stops playing and gets up] Whoa, hey Eric.

Cartman

Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.

Butters

[a little excited] A surprise? What is it?

Cartman

It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever!

Butters

[really excited] Oh boy!

Cartman

You ready?

Butters

Y-yeah!

Cartman

Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!

Butters

[closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and gets on his knees] Oh, okay! [Cartman grabs a handkerchief from his back pocket and makes a blindfold from it, then puts it on Butters]

Cartman

Hang on a second here. [makes sure the blindfold is on snugly]

Butters

How come uh, I can't see?

Cartman

'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? [rushes off to get the toybox]

Butters

Oh uh, ho yeah.

Cartman

[under his breath] All right, that's good. [undoes his pants] Okay, open your mouth, Butters? [lowers them and ...] That's good, just like that.

Butters

[wary all of a sudden] Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?

Cartman

...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. [lifts up his shirt to show his massive gut]

Butters

Well okay!

Cartman

All right, you ready? [grabs Butters' head and draws it closer to his own wiener] All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. [at that moment the door opens and Stephen enters.]

Stephen

Butters!

Cartman

Uh! [quickly gets dressed up]

Butters

Whoa! Hey Dad! [Cartman steps down from the toy-box and runs away]

Stephen

Butters! What are you doing?!

Butters

I'm getting a surprise! [points to his mouth]

Stephen

Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! [takes off the blindfold]

Butters

[looks around] Hey. Where'd Eric go?

Stephen

[quite concerned, on bended knee] Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?

Butters

Like what?

Stephen

Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.

Butters

What's... bi-curious?

Stephen

You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. [Linda appears at the doorway]

Linda

What's going on, you two?

Butters

Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. [smiles]

-----


South Park Church, day. Butters and Stephen are in the rectory.

Stephen

Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.

Father Maxi

Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?

Butters

...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.

Stephen

You see?

Father Maxi

Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.

Butters

Really?

Stephen

What can I do, Father?

Father Maxi

There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured.

Stephen

A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.

Butters

Whoa boy! Camp!

-----


Stan's living room. He, Kyle, and Kenny are playing a board game, Living. A door opens and closes, and Cartman appears.

Cartman

Haahaahahaha! [crosses his arms] Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!

Kyle

What are you talking about, fatass?

Cartman

[uncrosses his arms] I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!

Kyle

You figured that out, huh?

Cartman

[crosses his arms again as he turns away] That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. [pleased with himself]

Kyle

Except for us.

Cartman

Right, except for you.

Kyle

And all the people we tell.

Cartman

[turns around] Why would you tell anybody?

Stan

Because it's really, really funny.

Cartman

...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.

Kyle

Like what?

Cartman

Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch. [grins, but Stan and Kyle ignore him] Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! [chuckles]

Stan

That isn't funny.

Cartman

[angrily] Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!

Kyle

Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.

Cartman

Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys! [the other boys continue playing. Cartman changes tactics: he pleads] You guys, please don't tell anybody.

Kyle

Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.

Cartman

Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle. [turns around and cackles] Haha, hahahaha! [leaves the house]

-----


Camp New Grace entrance, night. Stephen pulls up with Butters, and some campers and camp staffers come out to greet them. Butters hops out of the passenger side, dressed in shirt and tie. Stephen goes to the trunk to bring out a suitcase.

Leader

Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters.

Campers

Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.

Stephen

[brings the suitcase to an elder staffer] Thank you so much for taking him in.

Director

Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.

-----


Camp New Grace interior, night. The camp director is showing Butters around.

Director

Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?

Butters

Because I'm bi-curious?

Director

That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy. [they approach a room] Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy. [Room 22] Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life. [the door opens, and a boy is shown hanging from a noose in the middle of his room. The stool and book he stood on are fallen on the floor. The director quickly closes the door and continues the tour] Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there. [notices another boy in front of them] Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?

Bradley

Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6

Director

Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

Butters

I'm bi-curious.

Bradley

Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.

Director

That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed. [(a boy has hanged himself) whispers softly to a staffer as the staffer walks by] We've got another one: Room 22.

Staffer

Aw, darnit!

-----


Community park, dusk. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are taking turns shooting the basketball at the hoop. Stan shoots and misses

Stan

Aw man, I've got H O R S now. [steps aside as Kenny receives the ball.]

Kyle

Okay, my turn. [Kenny gives him the ball and Kyle prepares to shoot. Cartman approaches the park behind him]

Cartman

Where is it, you filthy Jew?!

Kyle

[throws up the ball] Where's what?

Cartman

[grabs Kyle by the collar and shakes him violently] You know God damned well what!

Kyle

Let go of me.

Stan

What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!

Cartman

I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone! [shakes Kyle again] What did you do with my picture?!

Kyle

Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture.

Cartman

[rolls up his sleeves] Give it back, Kyle!

Kyle

I don't have it.

Cartman

I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now, [puts up his fists as if to box] I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here.

Kyle

Shut up.

Cartman

You shut up! You're lying, and [points an accusing finger at Stan and Kenny] you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews! [Kyle punches him on the right arm once, firmly] OW! [puts his left hand over his right arm] OW! AAAAUH! [grimaces, turns around, and runs out of the park] NYAAAAAAAAAA!

-----


Camp New Grace, chapel, day. Kids of every age are there singing in unison.

Campers


The Lord is love this forWith Jesus I can just say noAnd not be confused anymore.



Director

We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.

Butters

He's bi-curious too?

Director

Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!

Pastor Phillips

[flies onto the stage and prances about speaking flamboyantly] Helloooo campers! [twirls some and strikes a pose] Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man! [strikes a running pose] So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what? [jumps up into the air and does a 1080] It worrrrked! [strikes another pose, then eases up]

Director

That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip. [pulls on out of his back pocket] And just like a paper clip, [begins to mess with it] God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight. [presents the straightened paper clip. A Latino boy pulls out a gun, shoots himself through the temple, and goes down. Butters is startled. The director and Pastor Phillips just stand there.]

-----


Park County Police Station, South Park Division, day.

Det. Yates

So you say you were robbed. [fills out a police report]

Cartman

Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski.

Det. Yates

If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?

Cartman

It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!

Det. Yates

Okay, what is the picture of?

Cartman

[long pause] Why... why does that matter?

Det. Yates

Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?

Cartman

All right. It's a picture ...of me.

Det. Yates

Yes?

Cartman

It's a picture ...of me. [long pause] And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.

Det. Yates

[long pause] You were sucking somebody's penis. [this grabs other officers' attention.]

Cartman

No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!

Det. Yates

...I see.

Cartman

Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep.

Det. Yates

Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.

Cartman

I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!

Det. Yates

Well then, you're screwed.

-----


Camp New Grace, camp office. Butters and Bradley face the director and four staffers - one of them is a woman, another is Pastor Phillips

Director

You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?

Butters

Well sure, I guess.

Bradley

Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.

Director

And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?

Butters

Well yeah, sure.

Bradley

So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7.

Director

Then do you mind telling us why we found this [holds up a magazine with an aroused male model on one of its pages] 1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?

Bradley

That's... that's mine.

Director

You know this is strictly forbidden!

Butters

Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?

Director

[rises from his chair and walks up to Butters] What's wrong?! [thrusts the magazine onto Butters' face] This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!

Butters

Yes, it's all very confusing!

Director

This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids! [a gunshot and body drop are heard off screen and all the adults present look to their right. The director sighs twice, rests his left elbow on his desk, holds his left hand up, drops his head onto it, and closes his eyes. The other staffers take notice. Bradley looks down, Butters looks down, then around] Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!

-----


8:26 p.m., Cartman's room. Cartman sits at his desk looking distraught.

Cartman

That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now. [pounds his desk and gets determined] That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth. [grabs his ears and starts twisting them until they hurt] Ow. OW. OW!

-----


The Cartman's kitchen, moments later. Liane balances her checkbook and pays off some bills at the breakfast table. Cartman enters the kitchen, puts his head against the wall and begins to cry.

Liane

[taking notice] Eric? What's the, what's the matter? [walks over to him to console him]

Cartman

[crying throughout] I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow!

Liane

Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.

Cartman

Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.

Liane

Oh, now why would he do that?

Cartman

Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.

Liane

What is the picture of, Eric? [Cartman stops crying]

Cartman

[sniffles] Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.

Liane

Ohh, that's nice.

Cartman

But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay! [turns his face to the wall and cries again]

Liane

Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.

Cartman

[looks at her and sobs] But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee! [turns to her and cries into her chest]

Liane

It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.

Cartman

You, you will?

-----


Butters and Bradley are in their room doing penance - writing Biblical verses at the table.

Butters

...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!

Bradley

Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.

Butters

Awww, that's okay, Bradley.

Bradley

I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.

Butters

Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!

Bradley

You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great. [warm thoughts... Bradley panics and leaves his chair] Uh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!

Butters

Wuh-what's the matter?

Bradley

I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.

Butters

Well I like you too, Bradley.

Bradley

You do?

Butters

Well yeah!

Bradley

You like like me?

Butters

Sure, I like like you a lot lot. [laughs]

Bradley

Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! [runs to the door and opens it, then runs out and away]

Butters

[gives chase, but isn't fast enough] No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!

-----


The Broflovski house, dinnertime. The Broflovskis are eating. The phone rings and Sheila gets up to answer it.

Sheila

Hello?

Liane

Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.

Sheila

Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.

Liane

Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.

Sheila

[long pause] Excuse me?

-----


8:56 p.m., Cartman's room. Cartman is back at his desk fretting about the following day.

Liane

Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.

Cartman

It is? [happily jumps off his chair and runs to her] Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! [hugs her]

Liane

You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.

Cartman

[his smile vanishes] What?

Liane

She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.

Cartman

Mom, she's lying!

Liane

She said she was sure, Eric.

Cartman

Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!

Liane

Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.

Cartman

[thinks a moment] Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh.

-----


Camp office, night. Butters is in there talking to the director.

Director

Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!

Butters

I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.

Director

You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.

Butters

Oh no, my Dad?

Director

Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you, you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?

Butters

Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.

Director

We're fixing your confusion!

Stephen

There you are, Butters!

Director

Oheh- hey Dad.

Stephen

What's he done now?!

Director

Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!

A counselor

They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick! [Butters runs out, followed by Stephen, then the counselor, then the director]

-----


A bridge similar to the one in "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", day. Bradley is near the middle of the span, hanging on to the side but ready to jump off. A crowd has gathered at one end of the bridge. The director arrives, followed by Pastor Phillips, Butters, and Stephen

Director

Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!

Bradley

Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!

Director

No no, we're fixing you!

-----


South Park Elementary, next day. Cartman marches towards class with a slide projector. He turns left and enters the classroom

-----


Mrs. Garrison's class. Cartman approaches Kyle

Cartman

Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone? [Kyle turns around and Cartman is in his face. Cartman softly says] Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!

Mrs. Garrison

Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell. [writes the words on the board] Who'd like to go first? [Cartman holds down Kyle's arm while raising his own and grunts]

Kyle

Ow! Quit it, dude!

Mrs. Garrison

Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.

Cartman

HA! [gets up and goes to the board, pulls down the projector screen and clears his throat.] For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer. [clicks the projector on, and the class lights dim] This first picture I like to call "Moods of Winter" [a shot of snow-covered barren trees], a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?

Kyle

[to Stan] He isn't actually going to show everyone...

Cartman

And now this next picture [clears his throat. Quick cut to]

-----


The bridge near camp, day. Bradley is still hanging on.

Director

Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!

Bradley

It's too late.

Butters

[approaches the bridge] Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?

Director

You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.

Bradley

I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!

Butters

You're perfectly normal, Bradley.

Director

Get back! You're just as confused as he is!

Butters

[gets angry] All right. All right that does it! [turns around and faces the crowd] I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was! [Bradley listens] You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!

Bradley

Yeah.

Butters

I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! [Bradley thinks about this]

Bradley

I think. I think I'd like to come down now.

Director

He's coming down! [everyone begins to chatter] We did it! [stops by Bradley as Bradley climbs back onto the bridge's road] Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!

Stephen

Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.

Butters

No. I like bein' bi-curious.

Stephen

Well you know somethin'? So do I. [they both have a good laugh about it]

Butters

Wait. Now I am confused.

Mrs. Garrison's class. Cartman continues his presentation

Cartman

And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. [everyone gasps]

Bebe

Eww!

Clyde

[long pause] Dude.

Cartman

Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.

Mrs. Garrison

Eric, what the hell is this?!

Cartman

What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-

Mr. Mackey

[at the door] Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother? [reads the message] "Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk." She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? [walks away. Cartman stands there looking at the door, then at the class. Kyle has a look of pity for Cartman on his face and blinks]

Cartman

[longer pause] ...Lame.
