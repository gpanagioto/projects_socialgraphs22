Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek.  Just put it between its eyes. Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?  Oh, hey Butters. Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters. Uh oh. Alright, I'll chip in. Ready. Let's see 'em. Are they playing basketball?  Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish. What are we gonna do with them? Yeah, that'd be funny. Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened. Oh jeez, change the channel. They found the sea men! It's only a matter of time before they find the women, too! We're dead! Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are! Chef, we did something kind of bad.  We need you to promise not to tell anybody. We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach.  This is it. Yeah, stupid. Dude, it's probably still in her stomach.  What do we do now? Do you see the sea people. Yeah. Aaah! Let's go!  The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee. ...and then we put them back in the tank.  Oh no, what now?  How? How did that happen? They've already accomplished so much. Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture. Well, drop them in!  That's cool.  ...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose? Hm. Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come. Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything. Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue!  The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
