 Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered. Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced ''their'' opinion. Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something.  What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion. Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think. On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids!
