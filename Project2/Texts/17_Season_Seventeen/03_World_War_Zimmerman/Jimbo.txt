Can I help you? Alright, you want a rifle!  What is it you intend to shoot? ...You mean a person who's threatening you? Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you. You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law. See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not. No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida. So long as they're threatening you.
