I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives? I need to speak with him, please. I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir. Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends. I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.  ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away. Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!   Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them. Asshoooles!
