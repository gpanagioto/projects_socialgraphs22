I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.  Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that? What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.  Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him. I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good. Simple, Mimsy.  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe. Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a Black Mamba. Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready. Good luck, Jimmy. You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole. Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!  Not in our canoe, Mimsy! I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team. Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map. No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation. Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map! Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too. This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. "Turn left at the..." Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation! I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team! Miiimmmssssyyyy!  AAAAA! I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all. Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  It's a shark-mating whistle. No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf. Yes, Counselor Steve. The beach is warm.   Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle. Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you. You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh... Mimsssyyy! Get this thing off of meee! Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.  Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Dammit dammit! Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.  Yeeeah!  Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'? That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again! I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being. Shut up... Mimsssyyy.
