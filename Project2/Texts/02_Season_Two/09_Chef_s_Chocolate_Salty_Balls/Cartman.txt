No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding. Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding! I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch! ...bitch. I'm going! I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend! What ''kind'' of cookies? ''I'' wanna Fudge 'Em.  Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh? She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.  Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground. Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime. It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh? Yeah! Ay! Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week. Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. I'm <i>gon</i>na, just give me a minute. Yeah, I ''love'' these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef. Aw, man, smells like ass down here. Aw, man, let's get out of here! What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on? This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies? Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home.  Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh. No.  Oh my God. Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess. All of us? Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them. Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!  I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.  Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money! ''I'm not a sellout!'' What's a sellout? Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95! Selling T-shirts kicks ass! Whoa! Yes. And I've learned something, too. Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
