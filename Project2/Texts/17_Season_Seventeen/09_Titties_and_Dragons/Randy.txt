Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did ''not'' deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  Stay tough, rookie. We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?! OKAY?! Not one more good person dies on my watch!  Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO! Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?! What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyonc√©!  I've gotta save them! Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh? WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I ''REALLY'' CARE ABOUT HIM!
