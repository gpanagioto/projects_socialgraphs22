==Fictional character biography==
Brutale was a top-level interrogator/torturer for the secret police in the fictional Latin American country of Hasaragua, until a revolution forced him to flee. In Hasaragua, Guillermo Barrera served the secret police of his government as a savage interrogator, extracting confessions efficiently with blades and tools used for surgery. When the Marxist regime of Hasaragua fell, Barrera escaped the country to America, fleeing execution for the atrocities he committed.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Brutale | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 62  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>
