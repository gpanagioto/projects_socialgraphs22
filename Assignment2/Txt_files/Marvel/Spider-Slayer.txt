The '''Spider-Slayers''' are a series of fictional [[robot]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Spencer Smythe]], they were designed specifically to hunt down, capture, or kill [[Spider-Man]]. A new generation of Spider-Slayers was later created by Spencer's son, [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair]].

The Spider-Slayers have been featured in a number of Spider-Man adaptations outside of comics, including animated series and video games.

==Publication history==
The Spider-Slayers first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25 (June 1965) and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=29}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
:''See [[List of Spider-Slayers]] for a full breakdown of all versions of the Spider-Slayer.''

The first series of robots were originally designed and built by Prof. [[Spencer Smythe]] with the financial backing of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who piloted them for the pleasure of personally hunting the [[superhero]] he hated for capture and public unmasking. However, Spider-Man always managed to defeat each robot in turn. Smythe's continual efforts to perfect his machines backfired on him, leading to himself being fatally contaminated by [[radiation poisoning]] from the building materials of his creations. Blaming both Jameson and Spider-Man for this, he attempted, as a final act, to murder them both, but died just before Spider-Man thwarted the attempt.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #191-192</ref>

At one point, Jameson commissioned another scientist, Dr. [[Marla Madison]], to create a new and improved Spider-Slayer.{{issue|date=December 2012}} While that attempt failed, he eventually fell in love with her and married her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #167-168</ref>

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #19 (1985), Smythe's son, [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair]], emerged as the new builder of the Spider-Slayers. He swore revenge on Spider-Man, repeatedly attacking the superhero with his own series of Slayers. Smythe later mutated into a humanoid Spider-Slayer, but remains a minor foe.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The original Spider-Slayer was seen among the robots and machines in the [[Reanimator (comics)|Reanimator]]'s collection. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] later destroyed the Spider-Slayer when the Reanimator attempted to use it against him. It was later used by J. Jonah Jameson to attack the [[She-Hulk]] after she had married his son [[John Jameson (comics)|John]], but it was destroyed again.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #603, Jameson (now Mayor of New York) has some old Spider-Slayers sent to him from storage to better equip his "Anti-Spider Squad" to take down Spider-Man. The Spider-Slayer technology is combined with that of the [[Mandroid]] suits. However, the "Spider-Slayer Squad" wearing the suits quit their jobs after Spider-Man saves them and New York from a dirty bomb.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Despite not being technically related to the Smythes' and Madison's creations, when Spider-Man refits all the Octobots confiscated from [[Doctor Octopus]] and kept in the New York Police Precinct to carry an antidote able to reverse the mutations turning all the New York population into Man-Spiders, he humorously renames them his own ''Spider-Slayers''.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672</ref>

When the Goblin King and his Goblin Underground group cause havoc in Manhattan, Mayor J. Jonah Jameson unveils the Goblin-Slayers which he plans to use against the Goblin-related threats. Mary Jane Watson voices her concern that the Goblin-Slayers used to be former Spider-Slayers.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28</ref> Mayor J. Jonah Jameson orders Chief Pratchett to send one of the Goblin Slayers to the robbery location and then head to chase the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body). After Don Lamaze sacrifices his life to get out of the Goblin King's trap, the Superior Spider-Man confronted by a legion of Spider-Slayers with Mayor J. Jonah Jameson's face projected on the front faceplate. Mayor J. Jonah Jameson replies that he is done with being blackmailed by him and he does not care if he loses everything as long as he can finally bring down Spider-Man. The Superior Spider-Man tries to fight the Spider-Slayers, but discovers that they are far stronger than all the previous ones. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are deactivated remotely by [[Spider-Man 2099]], who confronts the Superior Spider-Man about who he really is and the reasons behind his actions of late. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are reactivated, to Spider-Man 2099's shock. The Goblin King's voice rings out, declaring that he has taken control of the Spider-Slayers as well, which grab both Spider-Men by their heads as the Goblin King comments that Norman Osborn now runs this city.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #29</ref>

In a ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' storyline following Smythe's death, dealers illegally sell Spider-Slayers to foreign nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/20689-spider-man-2099-swings-again-in-new-ongoing-series-with-peter-david.html|title = Spiderman 1 &#124; GamesRadar+}}</ref> However, after Miguel accompanies Tiberus Stone on one such deal, he ends up fighting the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] (who was hired by Alchemax to further test the Spider-Slayers) as Stone is captured by the local rebels,<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 2 #3</ref> Miguel defeating the Scorpion by tricking the Spider-Slayers into attacking him, while Stone's encounter with the rebels prompts him to change his mind about the original deal.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

Mistaking her for its quarry, the Spider-Slayer attacks Spider-Girl who manages to evade the machine due to being distracted by how different "Spider-Man" looks. Spider-Girl later returns to her own universe and time, while Spider-Man defeats the Spider-Slayer in the same way he did in the original story.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Tom DeFalco|penciller = Pat Olliffe|inker = Al Williamson|story = Father's Day/Slayers, Spiders, and Torches, Oh My|title = Spider-Girl|volume = 1|issue = #10-11|date = July 1999 - August 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

The serum warps Flash's mind and causes Flash to go on a rampage, which ends when subdued by Spider-Man (who reveals being Peter Parker to Jameson) and the Spider-Slayer, controlled by Jameson. Jameson realizes how irrational his hatred of Spider-Man is, and decides to help his adopted son fight crime using the Spider-Slayer.<ref>{{Cite comic

===Television===
* The [[List of Spider-Slayers#Mark I|Mark I Spider-Slayer]] appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Captured by J. Jonah Jameson". This version was built by Henry Smythe and is equipped with two metallic tentacle-like arms.
[[File:Spidermanep4.jpg|thumb|The Black Widow, Tarantula, and Scorpion Spider-Slayers combined in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series]]
* The Spider-Slayers appear in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series. In its self-titled episode, [[Spencer Smythe]], with help from [[Norman Osborn]], builds a Spider-Slayer called the "'''Black Widow'''" to hunt down Spider-Man. However, it is destroyed after a battle with the hero at Spencer's lab, resulting in its creator's apparent death. In the episode "Return of the Spider-Slayers", Spencer's son [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair]] joins the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], recreates the Black Widow, and builds the "'''Tarantula'''" and "'''Scorpion'''" Spider-Slayers, which are able to combine together. In the episode "Tablet of Time", Alistair creates the "'''Mega Slayer'''", a heavily armed android he can operate remotely. In the episode "The Ultimate Slayer", as punishment for his repeated failures, Kingpin's chief scientist Herbert Landon genetically mutates Alistair into the '''Ultimate Spider-Slayer''', who has organic laser guns growing from his shoulders in addition to superhuman strength and resilience. Alistair eventually breaks free from the Kingpin's control after Spider-Man helps him discover that Spencer is still alive and Kingpin placed him in [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic suspension]]. In the episode "The Wedding", the Kingpin uses a duplicate of the Mega Slayer to stop Goblin Glider-riding robots sent by Alistair and the second [[Harry Osborn|Green Goblin]] from crashing Peter Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s wedding, though it is destroyed while helping Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. The show was also supposed to feature the ''[[List of Spider-Slayers#Mark X|Alien Spider Slayer]]'' (Mark X), which was released as part of the series' tie-in toy line by Toy Biz, and also served as a boss in the series' [[Spider-Man (1995 video game)|video game adaptation]], but was cut for unknown reasons.
* A Spider-Slayer like concept called the '''Sentinel Prowlers''' appear in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} The Sentinel Prowlers are a prototype version of the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].
* The Spider-Slayers appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. These versions are creations of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Doctor Octopus]], who combined Spider-Man's DNA with [[Arnim Zola]]'s Synthezoids. The group consists of '''[[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]''' (voiced by [[Drake Bell]]), '''[[Scarlet Spider]]''' (voiced by [[Scott Porter]]), and the '''Delta-Nine Synthezoids''': '''Bone Spider''', '''Goliath Spider''' (both voiced by Imari Williams), and '''Ghost Spider''' (voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]]). Kaine is an imperfect Synthezoid who is highly resistant to damage, can reattach lost limbs, and feed off Spider-Man or the other Spider-Slayers' life energy. Scarlet Spider, later named [[Ben Reilly]] by [[Aunt May|May Parker]], is an almost perfect clone of Spider-Man barring a facial scar and powers. Bone Spider has claws and spikes all over his body; Goliath Spider is the strongest Spider-Slayer who can turn his body into metal; and Ghost Spider can teleport, become intangible, and generate bio-electricity. Scarlet Spider is introduced in the two-part episode "Hydra Attacks" and becomes an ally of Spider-Man and the Web Warriors' before eventually being revealed as a spy for Doctor Octopus, though he soon redeems himself. In the three-part episode "The Spider-Slayers", Spider-Man encounters Kaine before he and Scarlet Spider stumble onto the other Spider-Slayers. As Doctor Octopus escapes, Zola reawakens and commands the Delta-Nine Synthezoids to attack the Web Warriors, but they eventually defeat them and free the Synthezoids from Zola's control. The Delta-Nine Synthezoids are taken to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. Unbeknownst to the heroes initially however, Kaine returns in a mutated, misshapen form to infiltrate the Triskelion and absorb the Delta-Nine Synthezoids to become the "'''Ultimate Spider-Slayer'''". Despite this, he is defeated by [[Agent Venom]].<ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 1">{{cite episode|title=The Spider Slayers Part 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=21|airdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 2">{{cite episode|title=The Spider Slayers Part 2|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=22|airdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref><ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 3">{{cite episode|title=The Spider-Slayers Part 3|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=23|airdate=October 22, 2016}}</ref>

They consist of Sentries (which come in three variants: Medical, Combat, and Advanced Combat), Seekers (used to track down cross-species), and Hunters (arachnid-like flying robots called in by the Seekers to eliminate cross-species once they are found). There are also three special robots created specifically for citywide threats: S-01, a larger version of the Hunter that cannot fly, but can shoot lasers and homing missiles; S-02, a giant tentacled snake-like robot equipped with large drills that allow it to tunnel through buildings and underground; and S-03, a massive, heavily armed scorpion-like machine.
