Mars in Cartman's fantasy.

Cartman

[jumps] Whee! [waves at someone far away] Hi! [looks at a human city] So cool! [leaps towards the city]

Unnamed characters 1 and 2

[wave at Cartman] Hi!

Unnamed character 3

[waves at Cartman] Hi!

Cartman

Hi! [stops and sees a roller coaster] Dude, Mars rules. [leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules!

+++++


M Burger. Cartman is smiling while on a date with Heidi.

Heidi

What are you thinking about, Babe?

Cartman

Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.

Heidi

You're worried about him again, aren't you? Your friend, Kyle?

Cartman

[sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi.

Heidi

Then talk to him babe. Tell him what we're doing. Maybe you can get him back.

Cartman

You're right. You're right, Heidi.

The Broflovski residence. Gerald is at his office trolling people.

Gerald

[repeatedly clicks on keyboard and talks softly] Ha ha, yeah. I'm yours, bitch. Ha ha. [speaks louder]. Suck it! [moves the mouse] How about a dick in your mouth?! There you go! Ha ha, ha ha ha ha. [notices the door bell ringing] Aw! [walks to the front door, and opens it]

Trolls

Hi Skankhunt!

Gerald

[gets shocked] Ah! [tries looking behind him] What are you guys doing here?!

Dick

We came to celebrate!

PurpleheadedQueeflicker

Not everyday you troll a whole country.

Anonymous821

[showed a case of John Adams beer] We brought some beer. Let's have a trolling party.

+++++


The trolls have sat down and laughed each other

PurpleheadedQueeflicker

We did it!

Dick

I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world.

Trolls

Yeah! Yeah!

Troll 7

You said it!

SupersexyLisa18

Thanks to us!

Dick

And I think on the next one, [raises his beer] we're only gonna get better.

Troll 4

No doubt about it.

Gerald

Wh-what are you talking about "next one"?

Dick

Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world?

Anonymous821

We're like super-trolls who could change anything.

Gerald

[leans to Dick] Can I talk to you for a second?

+++++


Gerald and Dick walk to the kitchen

Gerald

Why did you bring them here?!

Dick

What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt.

Gerald

That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are!

Dick

But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election.

Gerald

The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political!

Dick

Of course it's political!

Gerald

No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?!

Dick

I remember being called a fag for no reason.

Gerald

Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go.

Dick

Okay. [puts down his beer mug] Sure, Skankhunt. Whatever you say. [walks away]

+++++


Marsh kitchen.

Garrison

Presidential election is only two weeks away. We have to [lifts a bag of memberberries talking] destroy these things.

Jar Berries

'Member the Bi-wing fighters? 'Member the Service Droids? I 'member.

Randy

[setting up experiment] That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried.

Experiment Berry

'Member, 'member Mos Eisley? 'Member the Rancor, 'member? 'Member sand people? 'Member the Cantina? 'Member-- [gets torched by Randy and screams] My eyes!

Jar Berries

What's going on now? They're using a torch on him. Oh, are they gonna use a torch on us?!

Experiment Berry

Ah, Aaaaah! [stops getting torched] 'Member Bespin? 'Member Wedge? I loved Wedge. 'Member?

Randy

Uh, there has to be something.

Garrison

Try the acid.

Experiment Berry

'Member Mon Mothma? 'Member the rebel transports? [screams while acid is poured on him]

Jar Berries

They're trying to destroy us. They are?! Our whole species?! They can't do that?! Yeah they can! 'Member the Death Star blowing up Alderaan? Oo, Alderaan, I 'member.

Experiment Berry

[keeps on screaming until Randy runs out of acid] 'Member the Cloud City? 'Member IG-88, the bounty hunter droid? 'member, that was fanta'tic.

Randy

Damn it! [takes off flashlight] These things are impossible to get rid of.

+++++


Broflovski bathroom. Kyle sits on the toilet, using his phone and then hears a knock from the other side of the door]''

Kyle

[tilts head up] Yeah.

Cartman

[opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute?

Kyle

Oh, what do you want now?!

Cartman

Just a second. Please, Kyle?

Kyle

Hurry up!

Cartman

Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby.

Kyle

Ah! Dude, what the fuck?

Cartman

Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.

Kyle

I'm going to the bathroom!

Heidi

Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset.

Kyle

Why?

Cartman

[walks away from the toilet] I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle?

Kyle

[looks down] I have to stay with my group, Cartman.

Cartman

[walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think.

+++++


Gerald's office. Gerald keeps on trolling.

Gerald

Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little-- [sees FaceTime call from Dick] Ah. Oh no, not again! [accepts his call] Yes?

Dick

Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins.

Gerald

I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting.

Dick

Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy.

Gerald

I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed.

Dick

[sighs] Oh, alright. Look, [grabs his guitar] I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?

Gerald

No!

Dick

[sings badly while strumming his guitar] Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie  flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the--

Gerald

[ends the call] Bye! Jesus, what is wrong with people?! [drinks wine] Huh. [keeps typing] Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank.

+++++


Turner residence. Cartman, Heidi, and Kyle walk near Heidi's room. Heide blocks the door before they go in.

Heidi

'[To Kyle.]' This is gonna seem a little weird to you, okay?

Kyle

What is?

Heidi

Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was.

Cartman

Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it.

Heidi

Before I stopped searching, I learned something. [opens her door] Take a look.

+++++


Cartman, Heidi, and Kyle enter Heidi's room. Kyle walks closer to Heidi's wall to his shock

Kyle

What is all this?

Heidi

To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it "emoji analysis". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away.

Kyle

Wow, that's pretty smart.

Cartman

She's funny too, Kyle.

Heidi

After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult.

Kyle

You mean like one of the teachers?

Heidi

I think... it's one of the parents.

Kyle

Are you sure?

Heidi

I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match.

Kyle

Emoji analysis, it's genius!

Cartman

You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.

+++++


Denmark. People are living their usual lives while some mourn at Freja Ollegard's grave. The setting moves to TrollTrace Headquarters.

Danes

[sing] En junker red ved juletid
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej
Omkring ham dalet sneen hvid
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej
Han stred sig frem i regn og blæst
Med et der segnede hans hest
Tjing tjang lu Tjing tjang lu
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej [stop singing]


Dane 8

[runs towards Bedrager] Sir, take a look at the [shows Bedrager analysis] statistical analysis. The servers are working.

Bedrager

So then we don't need any more funding?

Dane 9

[walks to Bedrager] No, sir. Using Heidi's emoji analysis, we have the final piece of the puzzle.

Dane 5

So far we have narrowed down the location of the troll attack on Denmark. [walks to map of the U.S. with state of Colorado highlighted] It is a location in the middle of the United States: a place they call "Colorido".

Bedrager

Colorido? That's a very goofy name.

Dane 5

We believe that very soon the servers will give us the place in Colorido that the troll originated.

Bedrager

[walks closer to map] Hmm hmm. Go on and hide in your cave, little troll. Soon, everyone will know where you live.

+++++


Marsh kitchen. Randy gazes the berry with electricity while its in pain.

Randy

[stops putting in electricity] Damn it! [takes off flashlight] Nothing kills these things!

Garrison

We have to keep trying. [walks to the jar and grabs it] Where did they go?

Randy

They're not in the jar? [turns around] That's it. Look, it's over.

Garrison

No, I'll go find more. [leaves kitchen]

Randy

[follows Garrison] It's over! Don't you get it?! [walks closer to Garrison] Even if we've found a way to eradicate them now, we don't have time to implement it nation-wide.

Garrison

Then how do we stop them from getting me elected President?

Randy

[walks away from Garrison] There's no other choice, Mr. Garrison. [stops walking] The American people have to be made to understand what's going on here. [turns around] You're gonna have to talk to them.

Garrison

[raises his hands near his head] No, no! I am done giving political speeches: I've tried being dirty, I tried being vulgar. [spreads his arm a little] Nothing matters!

Randy

[walks closer to Garrison] For the first time ever, [stops walking] you're gonna have to speak from the heart: not make it about you.

Garrison

Well that's just impossible.

Randy

You know what these things are capable of. Even if you lose the election, another one like you is gonna rise up and take your place. J.J. Abrams is seeing to that.

Garrison

[lays his hand on his face] Don't you get it, Randy? I'm not a politician. I never was.

Randy

All I know is that for the future of our country, you're gonna have to give one last speech: the speech that everyone needs to hear, a speech where you finally just talk like a normal human being.

Garrison

Oooh geeeeez!

+++++


Kyle's room, day. Kyle is at his desk working on math problems. His door is open and Cartman walks in.

Cartman

Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said Heidi wasn't funny, that was pretty lame, man.

Kyle

She wasn't being funny.

Cartman

	Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have this hangup against women?!

Kyle

I don't!

Cartman

	You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter! [turns to leave]

Kyle

Cartman, [leaves his chair] I did some research on the Danish Web site you've been helping out. You do realize that once TrollTrace is online, anybody can use it on anyone, right?

Cartman

Yeah, to catch trolls.

Kyle

So somebody, like Heidi, could use it to see your entire Internet history. Everything you ever said and did on the Internet, even before you were together.

Cartman

[a look of fear crosses his face] Well, Heidi doesn't actually use the Internet. We've sworn off that stuff, so it's kewl.

Kyle

Right, but somebody, like me, could look up your entire Internet history, print it out, and give it to Heidi. I would imagine there's some things you've done or said on the Internet you wouldn't want Heidi to know about.

Cartman

[thinks for a moment] ...Uh oh. [the recent past flashes through his mind, stopping off at the moment he saw Heidi's vagina in his room with the lights out, then moving on to the day he saw Ghostbusters]

+++++


The Bijou, day. Cartman and his mom leave the theater

Liane

Did you like the movie, hon?

Cartman

No, it sucked! I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now. [whips out his phone and types] "Dude, don't bother with new Ghostbusters. Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it." [puts the phone away] Can we get ice cream now? I wanna get the taste of ass out of my mouth. [fast forward to the present]

+++++


Kyle's room, present day

Cartman

How can they make what I said on the Internet available to the public? That's bullshit!

Kyle

It's available to everyone, stupid!

Cartman

	I gotta go! [runs out]

+++++


Randy's kitchen, night. The lights are out, only the moon shines in through the window above the sink.

Unknown Memberberries

Heehee, hurry! Come on, we have to hurry! Let's go.

Memberberry 1

[rolls away from toaster] This way, this way! We have to go this way, 'member?

Memberberry 2

[bounces away from toaster] Oh, I 'member!

Memberberry 3

[rolls away from toaster] Come on, we have to hurry! [rolls while Berry 1 bounces]

Memberberry 4

Memberberry 1

Shh.

Memberberry 2

Come on, 'member?

Memberberry 4

The Broflovski residence. Dick rings the doorbell and Gerald answers.

Dick

I miss my friend.

Gerald

Oh you got to be--Are you joking?!

Dick

I don't know how things got derailed but, I-I'm sorry if I made you upset. I want to be buddies again.

Gerald

Buddies like when? When were we buddies?

Dick

Come on, let's just have a couple of beers and do some trolling.

Gerald

I don't have time for you! I'm sorry, dude, but I have a life. I have a wife, and kids, [raises his arms] and shit to do!

Dick

Why are you mad at me'?

Gerald

Because you won't go away and let me just have fun!

Dick

I refuse to believe that Skankhunt is that shallow.

Gerald

[turns to his side] Oh here we go!

Dick

When you Photoshopped penises in Kesha survivors' mouths, it's not just to make people laugh.

Gerald

[faces Dick] Yes it is!

Dick

If someone Photoshopped a dick in your wife's mouth, would you just think it was funny?

Gerald

You mean my [shows his phone to Dick with image of Sheila Photoshopped] fucking screensaver.

Dick

It's true. You're just an asshole. I thought you were the ultimate rebel. I actually looked up to you and you're nothing but a super... dick.

Gerald

And what are [points at Dick] you, Dildo Shwaggins? Huh? You think you're a fucking political activist hauled up in your shitty little midget condo. You're nothing but a pissed off little giant, lashing out at everyone because you can't get laid!

Dick

At least I have a reason to be angry. What do you have, that it's funny? Hurting people is just worth the laughs?

Gerald

Stop trolling me.

Dick

One day you're gonna wake up and realize that you don't have anyone either.

Gerald

Stop fucking trolling me. [shuts the front door]

Bedrager

Focus everything on that area. It's time to see what these puppies can do.

Fort Collins, Colorado, MLKKK's house. MLKKK types at his computer and hears an air-raid siren and then turns on the TV.

News Reporter

Once again, if you live in the city of Fort Collins, there is a chance that all your emails and your entire Internet history has been made accessible to the public.

MLKKK

[checks his neighbor who is seen running out of the house screaming]

Fort Collins Citizen 1

[exits the house] Who the fuck are these emails to, and what the, what the fuck is MarriedButHorny.com?! [throws the Mac at her husband]

MLKKK

[sees his phone and picks it up with caution] Hello?

Unknown Caller

I know where you live now you son-a bitch.

MLKKK

Everyone in Fort Collins is panicking.

Fort Collins Citizen 3

They'll never forgive me! [jumps down from a high building]

MLKKK

From an alleyway, the back of a man holding a bucket is seen as he calls out to MLKKK

Unknown Caller

Hello MLKKK! [the man is now visible and is accompanied by his disabled daughter] You called my daughter "R2-D2". You know how long I waited this day, you son-a bitch! [charges forward and throws the bucket's liquid content onto MLKKK. He then strikes a match and throws it onto MLKKK, immediately setting him on fire]

MLKKK

Ahhhh! [begins to run around and screams in pain as he is engulfed in flames]

Unknown Caller's Daughter

Is he burning, Pa?!

Unknown Caller

He's burning bright, little girl.

MLKKK

Ahhhh! [continues to run around and scream as father and daughter watch]

A highway. Evening. A toy car is driven with a few Memberries on them. The berries talked while the song "Africa" is played.

Toto

Gerald's work office. Gerald watches a live stream news report on his computer.

News reporter

Complete panic and mass-hysteria tonight as the City of Fort Collins has been hacked. [aerial footage of an interesection is shown, with burning cars and a bus smashed together  while people run through the streets in panic]

Gerald

Oh my god. Oh my god, they've done it.

News reporter

The Danish are taking complete credit for the cyber-attack, blaming its successfully exposed and notorious troll. [A black and white photo of MLKKK's with the caption "MLKKK ANTHONY WEBSTER" is shown] The man has been identified as the Internet troll MLKKK, [the original photo moves to the side and a phtoto of MLKKK running while engulfed in flames as the unknown caller and his daughter look on is now shown] and was burned alive by one of his apparent victims. 

Gerald

Ah!

News reporter

The Danish claimed this was only a beta-test and soon the servers will be available worldwide. [turns his head to his left] Wait, so like they'll be releasing everyone's Internet history? Uh, I gotta go. [runs away]

Gerald

No! No no no no no! [FaceTimes Dick] Dildo, they done it! The Danish figured out how to hack everyone's Internet history!

Heidi

What is it, Eric? What's wrong?

Cartman

I-I, I don't know.

Heidi

Come on. We don't keep secrets, remember?

Cartman

It's just hard.

Heidi

You said you wanted to be perfectly honest with me, always.

Cartman

And I do. [breathes heavily] This one time, [wipes his nose] I think it was over the summer I went to see the new Ghostbusters movie.

Heidi

Yeah.

Cartman

And, and during the movie I was like "Wait, where is my phone?" and I couldn't find it; and then Jimmy said "Ha ha ha, screw you, Cartman," and he was holding my phone and he ran off with it and said, "I gonna send a bunch of texts and emails from your phone so that everyone thinks it's from you,"; and I was like "No, that's not cool!" and he said "Yeah," and he said a bunch of mean stuff before I went to go get him and I took my phone back; and I'm just worried th-that people look at my Internet history, they're gonna think all that stuff came from me!

Heidi

Well I'm glad you told me, 'cause now I know.

Cartman

So you totally believe me?

Heidi

Of course. [Cartman and her touch hands] You've never given me a reason not to believe you, babe.

Cartman (fantasy)

[sees Mars restored] Kewl! [leaps]

You have no reason to worry. People will know it wasn't you. With emoji analysis, everyone will be able to tell exactly where any comments came from.

Cartman (fantasy)

A campaign. Mr. Garrison gives a speech.

Garrison

My fellow Americans, we live in an un-presented time of uncertainty. I want to speak to you human-to-human because with God's grace, this will be the last time you ever hear from me. When I started this campaign I was saying a lot of shit because I was angry, [Gerald is seen in a bar, worried] and then I turned that anger into pushing buttons by more and more outrageous. Slowly, people started paying attention to me and I guess it made me feel powerful. Well now the chickens have come home to roost. [Kyle, Ike, and Sheila are seen having dinner in their home] Sooner or later, we all get exposed. [Gerald sees his family having dinner] We're all held accountable for what we say, what we do. [Garrison is seen again] There is only one thing that matters now. On November eighth, you must vote against me, and show the world that you didn't think the new Star Wars was all that good. When you're in that voting booth, remember that every vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote that shows the world we agree that The Force Awakens was more like a happy day reunion's special than a movie. The choice is yours, America. Please make the right one.

+++++


Clinton's office. Two FBI agents enter.

FBI agent 1

The Danish claim they will soon have the ablity to publish anyone's Internet history. We have to act fast, Mrs. Sandwich.

Clinton

I'll have you treat me with more respect. Haven't you seen the polls? It's president elects Sandwich.

FBI agent 1

We may not want to get too far ahead ourselves. [takes out a file of Skankhunt42 from envelope] TrollTrace must be stopped. [gives file to Clinton]

Clinton

Who is Skankhunt42?

FBI agent 1

We believe he's the only one who can save you now.

Waiter
