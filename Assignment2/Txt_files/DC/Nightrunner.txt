==Fictional character biography==
Bilal Alsselah ({{lang-ar|بلال الصلاح}}), a [[Algerians in France|French-Algerian]], was raised by his single mother on the outskirts of Paris, France. Though peaceful, on Bilal's birthday, he and his friend Aarif were caught in the middle of a protest, and beaten mercilessly by the police force. After they both healed, Aarif gave Bilal a gift including the music of Leni Urbana, an urban representative of the Muslim people in France, urging Bilal to listen to her words. That night Aarif was killed by police after he set fire to their station. After hearing of his friend's death, Bilal would forever be changed. Though he sympathized with the protesters, he found faults on both sides and decided to take a cue from Batman's origins: becoming a symbol, without racial or religious bias, that could make a difference for what's right and just. Already a superior parkour and freerun athlete, he donned the mask of Nightrunner in order to help the people's cause and bring justice to Clichy-sous-Bois.<ref>''Detective Comics'' Annual #12 (February 2011)</ref>

He assists [[Batman]] in taking down a child-slavery ring.<ref>''Batman'' Annual #28 (February 2011)</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://dccomics.com/dccomics/comics/?cm=20815|title=Batman: The Leviathan Strikes #1|access-date=January 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203095141/http://www.dccomics.com/dccomics/comics/?cm=20815|archive-date=December 3, 2011}}</ref>
