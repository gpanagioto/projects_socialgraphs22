 Baby! Oh, you're okay! It's all right, Stanley. We're gonna go home and talk about this with your dad. And we will get through this as a family!  Come on, get in the car! Stanley? Well? Do you wanna tell your father about what happened at school today? Noo, the other thing! Yes, the school shooting!  Are you serious?! Did you not hear what your child said?! Kids died at his school! Why are you all acting like this is normal? What is wrong with you people?!  No, I'm not okay! Children were shot! They were killed at a school where they were supposed to be safe!  Why does there need to be anything else?! Are you kidding me?! Why isn't anyone else emotional?! Don't you dare suggest that I'm only emotional because it's- GET OUT, RANDY! I'M NOT OVERREACTING! Thanks for coming, everybody. I'm sure you all heard there was yet another school shooting today. We have to figure out what we're going to do as parents because this whole thing is out of control!  We have to ask ourselves why this is happening and do something now! What are you talking about?  Do you understand that our children are being murdered? How much closer to home can this all hit?  It was at our children's school!   Randy, they announced on the news there's been another school shooting in Jefferson County! What is "cool" about that?! GOD!  I keep thinking... When will be the time when I get the call? You know? When will I answer the phone and find out my son, my daughter, were... killed? At school? I live in constant fear that I won't be there to protect my children when something happens to them. What?  What I'm saying is that I'm so overwhelmed that I- What the hell are you talking about?! I don't understand!  What is it? Oh my God!  Come on, we have to hurry! Why?? What the fuck is going on?  Realize what?! What have you been telling everybody, RANDY?! Menopause?! I'm not going through fucking menopause! I just got my period this morning! YES! YES! NO! NO NOTHING! Don't you guys see what's happened here?! I want you to be angry! Every day we hear about another school shooting! It used to be a big deal! I want it to be a big deal again. I mean Harriet, you came to my house and said there was a school shooting to trick me into going with you! Randy...  we need to talk. There's been... too much pain and suffering, and... it has to stop. What I'm trying to say is... I've been very emotional lately, and... maybe... maybe I do overreact sometimes. Maybe I need to realize that my emotions can be hormonal and not just take things out on you. Randy, I'm... sorry. Sorry, sorry, one second.  There's been another school shooting. Stan's been shot.
