==Fictional character biography==
The villain [[Mad Thinker]] creates an artificial lifeform based on the research notes of [[Fantastic Four]] leader [[Mister Fantastic]]. A synthesis of [[ape]] [[DNA]] and [[unstable molecules]] incorporated into an almost indestructible body with a [[microcomputer]] and a [[solar-power]] source, the newly christened ''Awesome Android'' is directed against the Fantastic Four, although the [[superhero]] team defeats both the Android and the Thinker.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #15 (June 1963).

The Android is legally [[emancipate]]d from the Thinker, with a court recognizing the being as a male with a new name, "Awesome Andy." Andy becomes a general office worker for the firm; lacking speech, he communicates via hand-gestures, body language, and a message board around his neck. The board, originally depicted as a chalk board, was [[retcon]]ned into a digital display screen with a [[Wi-Fi]] connection to his [[CPU]].

After a brief fight with a member of the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]], [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]], Andy inadvertently absorbs Starfox's [[pheromone]]-like abilities, causing Andy to gain the affections of his coworker Mallory Book.

==Powers and abilities==
The Awesome Android is created when the [[Mad Thinker]] steals and uses a technique invented by Mister Fantastic, involving splicing unstable molecules into the DNA patterns of an ape. It has limited artificial intelligence and no capacity for self-motivated activity, and is totally dependent on its programming or the programmer's spoken commands, and usually deactivates itself when not active.

The Android has inhuman physical attributes and can mimic an ability (one at a time) after touching an opponent, such as the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s rock-like epidermis or [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]'s frost coating. It can also emit close-range blasts of [[gale|gale-force wind]] from its mouth. The Android is given one weakness by the Thinker: a collection of [[Nervous system|nerve]] [[Ganglion|ganglia]] underneath the left armpit that if struck will cause the Android to shut down.<ref>''Avengers'' #286 (May 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>
