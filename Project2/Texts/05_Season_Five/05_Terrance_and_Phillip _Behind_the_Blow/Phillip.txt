Excuse me, buddy. I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage? Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting? No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without ''you'' farting? Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic? Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic? Ahhh  Yes? Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there. AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac! Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long?  Yeah, whatever, kid. What? Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?   Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening? Whatever. Where's my check?   What's HE doing here? So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?! Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us! Really? Let me take a look. Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes- You're right. It's a better one, asshole! Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?! That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!  What?  Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war. That's better.  Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on? Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said?  Wow, that sucks.  Terrance... I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.  We sssure did go through a lot together.  Terrance, I- That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks  Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted?  NO, I'm asking you his ''name''!
