It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with ''one'' shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" ''freak''! I mean ''look'' at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!  Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together! We worked it out, pal. Surprise!
