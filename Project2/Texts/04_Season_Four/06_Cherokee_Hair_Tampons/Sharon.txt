Hello, sweetie.  Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look.  Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People. There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information." Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say. Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information! Don't be a smartass, Stanley. Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually.  Oh, that's great news!  Ooooo. Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?! Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hairâ€”now that sounds natural. Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste. That's right. You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us! Enough, Stanley! It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing.  How dare you deceive us like that! Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.
