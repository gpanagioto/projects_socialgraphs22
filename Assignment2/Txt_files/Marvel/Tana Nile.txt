==Powers and abilities==
Thanks to the alien attributes of the Rigellian race, Tana Nile has the ability to increase her own density at will, increasing her strength and resistance to physical injury to superhuman levels. She has the psionic ability to control the mind of another humanoid or to override another humanoid's control of his or her voluntary muscles (through "mind thrust").

Tana Nile wears body armor of unknown composition, which includes devices enabling her to rearrange the molecular structure of her body and clothing in order to disguise herself as an Earthwoman. She was armed with a "stasis gun" that can project concussive energy or intense heat. She also uses a solar beam communicator device, worn on her wrist, permitting instantaneous communication between Earth and Rigel via hyperspace transmission.

After Tana Nile fled from Rigel-3 to continue her party lifestyle on Conjunction as a way to avoid the Rigellians' coming of age ritual called the Centering, the Grand Commissioner hired the Guardians of the Galaxy to bring her back to Rigel-3. After some difficulty and a special strategy from [[Drax the Destroyer]], the Guardians of the Galaxy were able to apprehend Tana Nile. While on their way back to Rigel-3 with Tana Nile, the Guardians of the Galaxy are warned by the Grand Commissioner that Tana Nile can throw tantrums most of the time and not to let her fall into the hands of a rebel Rigellian group called the Empathetics. As Tana Nile reminds him of his deceased daughter, Drax tries to keep her in a good mood. Eventually, the strain of being their prisoner causes Tana Nile to break Drax's stuffed toy Mr. Rhinopus and flee from the ship in a pod. Drax and Gamora track her to Scrapyard Drofnas where the Empathetics are. When the Empathetics start to harm Drax the Destroyer and Gamora, Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot arrive upon calling the Rigellian army. It was revealed during this time by Tana Nile and the Grand Commissioner that the Centering involves stripping the Rigellian of their emotions to get better control of their telepathy. When Tana Nile was caught in the tractor beam of the Grand Commissioner's ship with Drax also in toll, she accepts her fate as she passes this part of the Centering. Eventually, Tana Nile decides to follow in her father's footsteps where she plans to lead the Rigellians into an era of compassion and better understanding. In addition, she mails Drax a package containing his repaired Mr. Rhinopus. In the episode "Me and You and a Dog Named Cosmo," Tana Nile holds a Rigellian Peace Conference on Knowhere between the Grand Commissioner of Rigel and the Empathetics led by Jukka where Gamora and Drax the Destroyer help with the security detail. During the Universal Believers' attack on Knowhere, Tana Nile persuades her father and Jukka to use their telepathy to throw Drax the Destroyer towards the Universal Believers' flagship.
