Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the man who tried to kill you was Brian Boint, of WXNR, Fort Collins. When he saw there was no money in news anymore he sided with the ads, even though he knew it meant the destruction of our species. Back to you, Tom. Tom, it looks like a popup ad. Tom, that's Bill Keegan, WCFO. Augh!
