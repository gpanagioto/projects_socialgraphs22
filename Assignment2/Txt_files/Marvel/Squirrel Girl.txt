'''Squirrel Girl''' ('''Doreen Allene Green''') is a [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Will Murray (writer)|Will Murray]] and writer/artist [[Steve Ditko]], she [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 2 #8, a.k.a. ''Marvel Super-Heroes Winter Special'' ([[cover-date]]d Winter 1991). Murray created the character out of a desire to write lighthearted stories, in contrast to the heavily dramatic tales that were then norm in mainstream comics.<ref>''Ditkomania'' #79. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although distinct from Marvel's [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], Doreen has a genetic anomaly which gives her the ability to communicate with [[Squirrel|squirrels]], she has been a member of both the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], and has been a supporting character in stories featuring [[Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones]]. She has also appeared in her own solo series, which have depicted her dividing her time between her superhero adventures and her work as a college student.

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===
Squirrel Girl was created by writer [[Will Murray (writer)|Will Murray]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], making her debut in "The Coming of ... Squirrel Girl" in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 2 #8, a.k.a. ''Marvel Super-Heroes Winter Special'' ([[cover-date]] Winter 1991).<ref name=gcd-msh>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/Squirrel%20Girl/sort/chrono/ ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' (Marvel, 1990 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> She ambushes the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]], teams up with him, and, after Iron Man is captured, defeats the villainous [[Doctor Doom]]. The story also introduces her squirrel sidekick, [[#Monkey Joe|Monkey Joe]].

Murray has since described the character's genesis:

{{blockquote|Actually I created Squirrel Girl in script form without any artist input. Tom Morgan was originally going to draw it, but when he dropped out, I requested Ditko and got him. Ditko did a great job in bringing my baby to life. He invented that knuckle spike. It wasn't in the script. I based Squirrel Girl ironically enough on a long–ago girlfriend who read comics and was into "critters"—wild animals of all types. Coincidentally, she was a big Ditko fan. I think I got the idea because I had a bunch of squirrels running around my roof and sometimes coming in through my open bedroom window and inspiration struck.<ref name="Jazma Online">{{cite web|url=http://www.jazmaonline.com/interviews/interviews2009.asp?intID=355| title=Will Murray, Editor of ''Doc Savage''|date=May 2, 2009| publisher= JazmaOnline.com| access-date=2011-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027090135/http://www.jazmaonline.com/interviews/interviews2009.asp?intID=355|archive-date=October 27, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

===Later appearances===
Squirrel Girl next appeared in ''Marvel Year-In-Review <nowiki>'</nowiki>92'', where she made a one-panel appearance in the self-satirizing book's [[Marvel 2099]] section, where "Squirrel Girl: 2099" was listed as one of "the 2099 books we've pretty much ruled out" as actual future titles. Later, she was slated to join the [[New Warriors]], but writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] left Marvel before going through with his plan.<ref name="masked_intentions" /> In 1997, [[SkyBox International|Fleer-Skybox]] released cards based on Marvel Superheroes, one of which was a more sexualized version of Squirrel Girl.<ref name="Comic Collector Live">{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=44316926-2727-4199-bcb6-b4da0e5a0fdc|title=Fleer-Skybox Squirrel Girl Trading card|work=Comic Collector Live|access-date=2011-10-08}}</ref>

She did not appear again for nearly a decade. She was mentioned only once in comics during that time: In ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' #7, Deadpool's friend/maid/mother-figure/prisoner [[Blind Al]] mentions accidentally putting "bleach in with [Deadpool's] Squirrel Girl [[Underoos]]."

In 2005, comic writer [[Dan Slott]] wrote a four-issue [[miniseries]] for the superhero team the [[Great Lakes Avengers]]. Created in 1989, this team was made up of enthusiastic heroes with bizarre and nearly useless abilities. They had appeared only a handful of times over their 16-year history, serving as [[comic relief]]. As part of the team's series, roster changes were made and the Squirrel Girl character was revived and included on the team. The miniseries satirized [[comic book death]]s, and it was announced that a team member would die in every issue. After Squirrel Girl made a fuss to ensure that Monkey Joe would be an official member of the team, he was killed in the third issue. Slott would also pen further appearances for her and the team in the Christmas-themed ''GLX-Mas Special'' and ''GLI/Deadpool Summer Fun Spectacular'' [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Slott's stories satirized Squirrel Girl's unlikely victory over Doctor Doom from her debut appearance by depicting her as capable of defeating some of Marvel's other highest-ranking supervillains, including [[MODOK]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and [[Thanos]], mostly in comedically unexplained, off-panel ways.

During 2006's "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]" company-wide story arc, Squirrel Girl and the rest of the team fought Deadpool in ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #30. In 2007, she and the newly renamed "Great Lakes Initiative" again appeared alongside Deadpool in the ''Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular'' one-shot.

In September 2010's release of the five-part story line ''I am an Avenger'', Squirrel Girl appears in the first issue in the story "Welcome Home Squirrel Girl." The premise of the story was simply Squirrel Girl coming home to [[Manhattan]].

Squirrel Girl appears as a supporting character sporadically in the 2010-2013 ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' series, from issue #7 (February 2011) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). She is not a member of the team, but works as a super-powered nanny for the daughter of [[Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones]] while attending [[New York University]].<ref name="New Avengers #7">''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #7</ref>

===''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl''===
{{main|The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl}}
On October 6, 2014, Marvel announced that Squirrel Girl would, for the first time, be starring in her own series, ''[[The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl]]'', written by [[Ryan North]] and drawn by [[Erica Henderson]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=56067|title=Villains Tremble as North Kicks off 'The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl' |date= October 7, 2014| first= Dave |last= Richards| website= ComicBookResources.com| access-date= October 14, 2016}}</ref> The series' first issue was released on January 7, 2015. The series' title alluded to the character's infeasible history of defeating high-level Marvel villains, and its central premise puts a twist on the idea, presenting Squirrel Girl as "unbeatable" because she always pursues non-violent solutions, befriending villains and helping them turn their lives around, rather than actually fighting them.

''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' ran for eight issues before being rebooted in October 2015 as part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding with Squirrel Girl being part of ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/all-new-all-different-marvel-your-guide-to-the-avengers-team-books/ |title=All New, All Different Marvel: Your Guide to the Avengers Team Books |website=ComicsAlliance.com |first=Andrew |last=Wheeler |date=July 1, 2015 |access-date=October 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706194604/http://comicsalliance.com/all-new-all-different-marvel-your-guide-to-the-avengers-team-books/ |archive-date=July 6, 2015 }}</ref> ''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' continued as monthly publication until November 2019, for a total of 58 issues. Derek Charm took over art duties in May 2018.

Strong [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade]] sales at school book fairs encouraged the team to develop an original graphic novel, ''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Beats Up The Marvel Universe!'', released in October 2016. While Henderson told ''The Hollywood Reporter'' balancing the graphic novel and monthly series "was almost too much work," North expressed interest in another graphic novel, calling it "a fun challenge."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/unbeatable-squirrel-girl-creators-explain-934736|title='Unbeatable Squirrel Girl' Creators Explain How to Beat Up the Marvel Universe (Kind Of)|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=2016-10-04|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}</ref>

Starting in 2017, Squirrel Girl appeared in ''[[U.S.Avengers]]'', a replacement title for ''The New Avengers''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-gets-patriotic-with-usavengers-series-from-ewing-medina|title=Marvel Gets Patriotic with 'U.S.Avengers' Series from Ewing & Medina|date= July 1, 2016|first= Brett| last= White| website= ComicBookResources.com| access-date= October 14, 2016}}</ref>

==== Podcast continuation ====
In April 2022, [[Marvel Entertainment]] and [[Sirius XM]] launched ''Marvel's Squirrel Girl: The Unbeatable Radio Show'' which is a six-episode podcast series that acts as a direct continuation of the comic series. It is written by North, directed by Giovanna Sardelli and stars [[Milana Vayntrub]] as Squirrel Girl; the series is produced by Radio Point.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Maas |first=Jennifer |date=April 18, 2022 |title=Marvel Launches ‘Squirrel Girl’ Scripted Podcast From Writer Ryan North (EXCLUSIVE) |url=https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/squirrel-girl-podcast-marvel-siriusxm-1235228417/ |access-date=April 18, 2022 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=April 18, 2022 |title=Marvel and SiriusXM Launch Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Podcast From Ryan North |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvel-siriusxm-unbeatable-squirrel-girl-podcast-ryan-north/ |access-date=April 18, 2022 |website=[[ComicBook.com]] |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, North "wrote an all-new 'Squirrel Girl' vertical comic tie-in" which debuted on [[Marvel Unlimited]].<ref name=":0" />

==Fictional character biography==
{{long plot|date=December 2017}}
[[Image:Sqlgrl1.jpg|thumb|left|Squirrel Girl, in her initial appearance]]
Doreen Allene Green was born to Dorian and Maureen Green in Canada. When she was 10 years old, Doreen discovered she could communicate with squirrels; she suffered a modification in her genes for unknown reasons that granted her squirrel-like abilities, which manifested predominantly as a prehensile tail.
When her parents consulted a doctor, it was determined that Doreen wasn't a mutant, even though she believed so for a long time. She is first seen as Squirrel Girl ambushing [[Iron Man]] in a forest, hoping to impress the veteran hero and become his [[sidekick]]. The 14-year-old introduces herself and her pet squirrel, Monkey Joe, and displays her squirrel-themed abilities. After she rescues Iron Man from [[Doctor Doom]] with the help of a horde of squirrels, Iron Man says she is too young to fight crime, but that he will put in a good word for her to the Avengers when she is older.<ref name="marvelsh-v3-8">''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 2 #8</ref>

===''Great Lakes Avengers''===
Years later, having moved to [[New York City]], Doreen joins the [[Great Lakes Avengers]]. Squirrel Girl introduces each issue of the team's miniseries, providing an opinion about the contents of the series. Her sidekick Monkey Joe also joins the team and comments upon the series as well. He is later killed by Leather Boy, a rejected GLA member who was disguised as Doctor Doom. Enraged by the death of her friend, Squirrel Girl assembles a squirrel army to stop the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]]. She finds a new squirrel companion during this battle, the only one of her squirrel army who survived. Doreen names her [[#Tippy-Toe|Tippy-Toe]]. After receiving a subpoena from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and discovering that her teammates are all mutants, the team renames themselves the Great Lakes X-Men, complete with new costumes.<ref>''GLA: Misassembled'' #1–4 (2005)</ref>

During the ''GLX-Mas Special'', Squirrel Girl and Tippy-Toe defeat the [[supervillain]]s [[M.O.D.O.K.|MODOK]], [[Terrax]], and [[Thanos]]. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Dum Dum Dugan]] tries to recruit her, explaining that the organization had been watching her for some time. Doreen declines the offer, saying she is happy with the Great Lakes X-Men.<ref name="glx-mas">''GLX-Mas Special'' (Dec. 2005)</ref>

After helping the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] defeat [[Bi-Beast]], Squirrel Girl was invited to the annual Superheroes [[Poker]] Tournament and brought the team with her. In the end, [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]] won the tournament with a straight flush, beating the Thing's four fours. After being discouraged from using the names X-Men and [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] by members of those teams present at the tournament, and since Flatman was the champion of the tournament, the team renamed themselves the Great Lakes Champions, despite protests from former [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions of Los Angeles]] member [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''The Thing'' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' crossover storyline, Squirrel Girl and the Great Lakes Champions registered under the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], as revealed when [[Deadpool]] attempted to apprehend them for violating the Act, only to be defeated and informed that they had already registered.<ref name= "cable_and_deadpool-30">''Cable and Deadpool'' #30</ref> Under the Registration Act, Squirrel Girl remains a member of the again-renamed Great Lakes Initiative.<ref name="deadpool-gli-summer">''Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular</ref>

Squirrel Girl and the GLI, along with Deadpool, are sent to save [[Dionysus (Marvel Comics)|Dionysus]] after he fell from [[Mount Olympus]] and was captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], who planned to use his powers to cause mental instability in superheroes they consider a threat. After their victory, Squirrel Girl helps Dionysus back to Olympus and to his own bed to sleep it off. (It is later revealed that she is a fan of the superhero team the [[New Warriors]], especially [[Robbie Baldwin]], the hero Speedball, on whom she has a crush, and the two eventually share a kiss.<ref name="masked_intentions" />) Squirrel Girl convinces Doctor Doom to let her use a time machine to prevent Speedball from becoming the guilt-plagued hero Penance. The device instead takes her into the year [[Marvel 2099|2099]], where she encounters an alternate, future version of Speedball, whom she unsuccessfully tries to have return with her to her present day. She also encounters a future version of [[Mister Immortal]] who convinces her to kick Deadpool out of the team, which she does after returning to her own time.<ref name= deadpool-gli-summer />

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the team confronted a [[Skrull]] disguised as [[Grasshopper (comics)|Grasshopper]], with help from [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] and Catwalk.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19 (Dec. 2008)</ref> They later appeared to welcome Gravity as leader of the team, after he was transferred to Wisconsin by [[Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref>

After defeating [[Fin Fang Foom]] and finding little support from her teammates on the again renamed Great Lakes Avengers, whom she believes have her shoulder most of their work, she exits the group.<ref name= age_of_heroes_3>''Age of Heroes'' #3</ref>

===''New Avengers''===
When [[Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones]] seek a nanny for their daughter Danielle, they hire Squirrel Girl. It is also revealed that Doreen had a brief relationship with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (then a member of the New Avengers), which did not end happily.<ref name="New Avengers #7"/> During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Danielle gains spider powers.<ref>''Spider-Island: Avengers'' #1 (September 2011)</ref> During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Squirrel Girl runs to the mansion to pick up Danielle while New York is attacked by the [[Thule Society]]. Upon arriving on the mansion, she and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] protect Danielle while fighting Thule Society soldiers.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #15-16</ref>

She later helps the New Avengers fight the [[Revengers]],<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 Annual #1</ref> [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]],<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #19-20</ref> and the [[Dark Avengers]].<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #21</ref> When Luke Cage and Jessica Jones leave the team,<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #31-33</ref> Squirrel Girl follows them as Danielle's nanny.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #34</ref>

She and Tippy Toe have since rejoined the team in the wake of the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #1 (October 2015)</ref>

===''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl''===
Doreen begins her college career at Empire State University, majoring in [[computer science]]. Upon arriving, she ends up fighting [[Kraven the Hunter]], who was lashing out at the local squirrels including Tippy Toe, whom he caught and was about to kill. She stops him by informing him of the existence of sea monsters like [[Giganto]] and challenges him to hunt them. Later, she discovers that [[Galactus]] is heading to Earth to devour it, and she steals Iron Man's armor and heads to the Moon with Tippy-Toe. On their way, they defeat [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]], who had attacked Squirrel Girl, mistaking her for Iron Man. She and Tippy-Toe surprisingly befriend Galactus instead of fighting him, and afterwards tell him of a planet that could sustain him even better than the Earth. This planet is devoid of intelligent life but rich in nuts, which Galactus has developed a new liking for. He then sends the two back home,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Girl|first1=Squirrel|title=Squirrel Girl|url=http://marvel.com/|website=Marvel|access-date=November 28, 2017}}</ref> and he leaves the Earth to live another day. When she arrives back home, her roommate Nancy Whitehead tells her that she has figured out she is a superhero, but promises not to tell anyone, the two becoming good friends. Later, Squirrel Girl and other superheroes defeat [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]], who was attacking [[Liberty Island]] with an army of robot dinosaurs. Shortly thereafter, while attempting to stop [[Hippo (comics)|Hippo]] from robbing a bank, she meets Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boi, both of whom have the ability to speak to different animals. Nancy reveals their secret identities (Tomas Lara-Perez and Ken Shiga, respectively) to her, since she easily recognized them under their masks. They later encounter a monstrous Asgardian squirrel god, [[Ratatoskr]], who had been causing mayhem on the city by trash-talking its citizens during their sleep, but is defeated with help from [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] and the current and former [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' #1-8</ref>

During their second college year, Doreen and Nancy encounter [[Brain Drain (comics)|Brain Drain]] and quickly defeat him due to his extremely outdated technology and crucial design flaws. Upon realizing that he did not have a choice about his evil actions due to his programming, Doreen and Nancy updated his technology to modern standards. When he awakens, Brain Drain reveals that he intended to reform and ends up enrolling at ESU to take computer science courses. Later, she and her classmates get sent back in time to the 1960s by fellow student Cody (who sent them away from the present time in order to curve his grade). Nancy, the only person who remembers Doreen's existence, goes back to rescue her along with a past version of Doctor Doom, who then learns that he'll successfully take over the world thanks to a copy of Wikipedia on Nancy's phone. In the present day, Cody wakes up to a Doctor Doom dystopia and takes himself back to the 1960s with an older, future Doreen to help fight Doom. Doreen defeats Doom by repeatedly using Cody's time machine to send herself a day before the fight, creating a small army of Squirrel Girls that swarm Doom and force him to give up. Doreen and the students are sent back to the present, while future Doreen stays behind and continues to foil Doom's schemes.<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' vol. 2 #1-5</ref> One of the [[Doombot]]s manages to survive and becomes obsessed with living a "normal" human life. He later ends up hiring and then facing off against [[Gwenpool]] in an attempt to remove a group of aliens that are hunting her from the planet. After changing his plans upon deciding that Gwen herself is the bigger threat he tries to team up with the aliens and destroy her. This backfires and she forces him to fight the aliens by threatening his kind elderly neighbors. He does capitulates and to his horror gets the credit for destroying the aliens and becomes a media sensation as everyone wonders what heroics he will do next, ruining his idealistic normal life.<ref>''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #7-10</ref>

Later, she gets jealous when her crush, Chipmunk Hunk, starts dating someone. Nancy, Tippy Toe, and Koi Boi help set her up an online dating profile, which leads to many unsuccessful dates, one of which ends with an encounter with the [[Mole Man]], who is angered by how Doreen's earlier suggestions to Kraven has affected his home. Doreen apologizes to him and the two have a conversation about his situation, leading the Mole Man to proposing to Doreen on the spot and a number of follow up schemes to get Doreen to go on a date with him. He threatens to bury a number of worldwide landmarks if she doesn't date him, and after Nancy is nearly kidnapped by him and being swarmed by the media, she goes to confront Mole Man only to find that the Tricephalous is in love with him. Doreen lets the beast defeat her to woo Mole Man and get him off her back for good, and decides that dating isn't right for her at the moment after seeing that Chipmunk Hunk's girlfriend is a nice fit for him.<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' vol. 2 #8-10</ref>

Squirrel Girl also had an alternate version of herself due to time travel running around for decades interfering with Doctor Doom's plans. As a result, she released an AI [[Doombot]] that eventually became [[Gwenpool]]'s nemesis, Vincent Doonan.{{issue|date=July 2017}} They later reconcile and at Gwen's insistence he even lets Squirrel Girl examine him for her computer class. She then follows Gwenpool to Hell to rescue her brother Teddy Poole and they defeat Mephisto. While there though Gwen points out that in the Marvel universe the devil is very real and punchable, suggesting that heroes should do so all the time confusing Squirrel Girl. Running out of pages, Gwen then leaves, getting Teddy back to Earth to her and runs off to do other things before her comic comes to an end.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

Squirrel Girl later becomes a member of the [[U.S.Avengers]].<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #1-3</ref>

==== ''Marvel's Squirrel Girl: The Unbeatable Radio Show'' ====
While at Empire State University, Squirrel Girl is the host of an [[AM broadcasting|AM broadcast]] [[Call in show|call-in show]] where she answers questions regarding what it's like to be a superhero. She's joined by her friends Tippy T. Squirrel, Nancy Whitehead, Koi Boi, Chipmunk Hunk and Brain Drain.<ref name=":0" />

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
During Squirrel Girl's first encounter with Iron Man, she provided a detailed demonstration of her powers and abilities: a furry, [[prehensility|prehensile]] tail roughly 3–4 feet long, sizable buck teeth strong enough to chew through wood, and superhuman strength and agility that allows her to easily jump between trees. Her fingers have sharp claws that assist her with climbing, and she possesses retractable "knuckle spikes" roughly 2-3 inches long on each hand. Most importantly, she can communicate with and understand squirrels, but does not communicate with squirrels telepathically. Squirrels have also been depicted as understanding her when she speaks in English.

Later appearances have revealed additional abilities possessed by Squirrel Girl including heightened reflexes (which she dubs as 'squirrelgility') and vision (her eyes have been seen to glow red in low-light situations) and she has also at times displayed an enhanced sense of smell. Squirrel Girl has also revealed that her lips taste like [[Corylus avellana|hazelnut]]s,<ref name="masked_intentions">''I (Heart) Marvel: Masked Intentions''</ref> though this attribute has since been [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by ''Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' writer [[Ryan North]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.themarysue.com/interview-squirrel-girl-ryan-north/|title = Interview: Unbeatable Squirrel Girl's Ryan North Talks Nuts, Fighting Galactus, & Hazelnut Lip-smacking|last = Cook|first = Mary|publisher = The Mary Sue|date = 7 January 2015|website = themarysue.com|access-date = 16 October 2015}}</ref> She is also a superb hand-to-hand combatant capable of taking down Wolverine in a one-to-one no-claws fight.<ref name="New Avengers Vol. 2 #15"/>

Squirrel Girl carries a [[belt (clothing)#Variants|utility belt]] comprising multiple pouches that contain nuts to give as snacks to her squirrel friends. These are known humorously as her "nut sacks". It was originally unknown whether the black markings around her eyes are the result of her mutation, or cosmetically applied to enhance her squirrel-themed appearance (though they did not appear to smear when she's crying).<ref name="gla4"/> In ''The New Avengers'' Annual #1, she is shown in casual clothes lacking these markings.<ref>''The New Avengers'' Annual #1</ref>

Squirrel Girl is also shown carrying a full set of 'Iron Man Vs. Series battle cards', which she uses to show [[Dum Dum Dugan]] how she knows him (she mentions Dugan has a 'defense stat of 8'; her own is 6, although the rating system is left unclear). After [[MODOK]] is pointed out to her, she consults the supervillain's own card to confirm his abilities. The printing on the two cards shown (Dugan's and MODOK's) is actually gibberish.<ref name="glx-mas"/> In her solo series ''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'', she has a set of 'Deadpool's guide to Super Villains' cards to help her identify villains and their possible weaknesses. The writing on these are legible, and tend to contain both valuable information  as well as comedic jokes about her opponents. She only owns the super villain set, though some antiheroes such as Ant-Man still have cards in her collection.

In the ''GLX-Mas Special'', she is shown flying a small [[autogyro|gyrocopter]] called a 'Squirrel-A-Gig' and mentions it was a gift from GLA teammate [[Big Bertha (comics)|Big Bertha]]. This reappears in ''Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular'', used as a way of infiltrating [[Doctor Doom]]'s castle. The first version was a standard gyrocopter, while it is later shown as a more stylized superhero [[helicopter]] (including squirrel-styled bodywork). Squirrel Girl is shown as being able to fly the craft expertly, including through the [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] defenses surrounding [[Latveria|Castle Doom]], crediting this to her 'squirrel-agility'.

In ''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'', she also temporarily obtains a set of armor based on pieces of Iron Man's modular armor that reshapes to fit her, including her tail.<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' #2</ref> The same series also retcons her status as a mutant, noting that her powers are the result of an unspecified "something" relating to her [[RNA]] or [[DNA]], and that she is "medically and legally distinct from being a mutant."<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|colorist = Rico Renzi|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Wil Moss|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 2|issue = #1|date = 28 October 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Another ability showcased in ''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' is Doreen's enhanced jaw strength. Due to her proportional squirrel abilities, she can bite with one million and eighty-five thousand pounds of pressure. This gives her the ability to bite through solid steel.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Derek Charm|inker = Derek Charm|colorist = Rico Renzi|letterer = Travis Lanham|editor = Wil Moss|title= The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 2|issue = #33|date = 13 June 2018|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==Known squirrels==
Squirrel Girl is always accompanied by one or more squirrels. Two of these, Monkey Joe and later his successor Tippy-Toe, have been her constant companion. At her insistence, they have each been accepted as a full member of the Great Lakes Avengers.

In addition to Monkey Joe and Tippy-Toe, Squirrel Girl named several other squirrels in ''Great Lakes Avengers'' #4. Slippy Pete, Mr. Freckle, and Nutso are presumed dead; they were sucked into the singularity created by [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]].

===Monkey Joe===
'''Monkey Joe''' appeared in Squirrel Girl's original appearance in ''Marvel Super-Heroes Special'' vol. 2 #8, and all four issues of the ''Great Lakes Avengers'' miniseries.

The [[paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] of the ''Great Lakes Avengers'' miniseries contains a dedication to the memory of Monkey Joe: "Monkey Joe 1992-2005. He loved nuts. He will be missed."

In Squirrel Girl's first appearance, Monkey Joe helped her to defeat Doctor Doom. Shortly after Squirrel Girl joined the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], Monkey Joe met his demise at the hands of Leather Boy, an ex-G.L.A. member who had been rejected by the team due to his lack of powers, and who dispatched the squirrel while dressed in a variation of Doctor Doom's costume.<ref name="gla3">''Great Lakes Avengers'' #3</ref> Monkey Joe's death was part of the series' promise{{where?|date=October 2015}} that a member of the G.L.A. would die in each issue of the miniseries, in a parody of [[comic book death]]s.

Monkey Joe was smarter than an average squirrel, even proving adept in the use of computers. He served as the sardonic commentator on the ''Great Lakes Avengers'' miniseries, appearing alongside the story titles holding signs with humorous, often [[sarcasm|sarcastic]], remarks on the events. After his death,<ref name="gla3"/> the narrator circle showed a deceased Monkey Joe, complete with flies circling the corpse. Reappearing in the narrator circle,<ref name="gla4"/> he possessed a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]].

When [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] visited the afterlife, he met Monkey Joe, who was playing cards with the rest of the fallen G.L.A. members.<ref name="gla4">''Great Lakes Avengers'' #4</ref>

===Tippy-Toe===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of X-Men teams]] -->
After the death of Monkey Joe, Squirrel Girl found a new companion, a female squirrel whom she named '''[[Tippy-Toe]]''' and provided with a pink bow.<ref name="gla4"/> Tippy-Toe replicates Monkey Joe's role as Squirrel Girl's sidekick almost exactly. Though apparently less intelligent than Monkey Joe, Tippy-Toe may in fact be smarter than she lets on and has proved her worth in short order.

A member of the squirrel army summoned by Squirrel Girl to join the fight against Maelstrom and Batroc's Brigade, Tippy-Toe was the only squirrel Doreen was able to save from Maelstrom's Cosmic Crunch device.<ref name="gla4"/> Squirrel Girl also briefly considered the name Monkey Joe 2 for her.

Tippy-Toe accompanied and assisted Squirrel Girl in defeating [[MODOK]] and [[Thanos]] (she scratched MODOK's face, then entered his exo-chair and disabled it). Squirrel Girl left Tippy-Toe behind when she went to fight [[Terrax]], and the squirrel was targeted by Deathurge, who sought vengeance for being stranded on Earth and trapped in squirrel form. However, Tippy-Toe managed to trick Deathurge and defeat him, with help from Mr. Immortal.<ref name="glx-mas"/> During the Civil War story arc, Tippy-Toe joined the Great Lakes Champions in siding with Iron Man's pro-Superhuman Registration group.

Tippy-Toe is able to understand her teammate's comments, complaining when [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] discounts her as a viable teammate for a mission. She has also been seen using tools that a squirrel wouldn't normally be able to use such as being able to wield a screwdriver<ref name="deadpool-gli-summer" /> and operate a blender which Mr. Immortal complains to Squirrel Girl about Tippy-Toe whipping up acorn smoothies that keep compromising the machine.<ref name="glx-mas" />

==Squirrel Girl's victories==
Following her defeat of Doctor Doom,<ref name="marvelsh-v3-8"/> an ongoing joke depicts Squirrel Girl repeatedly attaining victory over various villains, some of whom are considered to be more powerful than she is. Typically, these victories occur off-panel, though some, like her battles with [[Deadpool]],<ref name="cable_and_deadpool-30"/> [[MODOK]],<ref name="glx-mas"/> and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]<ref name="New Avengers Vol. 2 #15">''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #15</ref> are shown. Her victories often result from her opponent's overconfidence, weakness from an earlier fight, or creative use of her powers. For example, her defeat of Bi-Beast: While visiting squirrel friends in [[Central Park]], Squirrel Girl came across the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] fighting Bi-Beast. She told the squirrels to retrieve the smelliest garbage they could find and place it around the combatants, resulting in everyone having to hold their noses. Bi-Beast had two heads, and two noses, and had to use both hands to hold his noses, leaving himself defenseless, allowing the Thing to knock him out.<ref name="thing_v2_8">''The Thing'' vol. 2 #8</ref>

Squirrel Girl's defeat of Thanos is an ambiguous one. [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] was present at the battle and claimed Squirrel Girl defeated the genuine Thanos and not a clone or copy.<ref name="glx-mas"/> However, the same writer responsible for that story would soon after write another tale in which Thanos claimed to have perfected a means of creating clones of himself that could fool even "the most cosmic of beings." Adding to the ambiguity is the fact that the reveal comes from the mind of a clone whose memory had been altered.<ref name="she_hulk-v2-12">''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #12-13</ref>

Squirrel Girl has also saved the world from [[Galactus]], but she does not technically defeat him (though she tries to harm him when they first meet). Instead, she befriends Galactus and convinces him not to destroy the Earth.<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' #4</ref>

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] mentioned the popularity that Squirrel Girl has among writers as a factor in the unanimous decision to use her in the role of the nanny in "New Avengers." After announcing the character at the 2010 Comic-con panel, Bendis described the audience's reaction: "[it] was so loud, the applause went on for so long ... the place went nuts for a while." He described the applause as comparable to that received by [[Stan Lee]] when he entered the room.<ref name="Newsarama">{{cite web |date=2011-10-15 |title=Interview with Brian Michael Bendis |url=http://www.newsarama.com/common/media/video/player.php?aid=39006 |access-date=2011-09-04 |work=[[Newsarama]]}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' has reacted positively to her appearance in the more mainstream ''New Avengers'' comic, claiming, "issue [15] goes a long way towards painting her as a more fleshed out human being with real desires. Bendis hasn't quite found a truly unique voice for her yet, but regardless, it's nice to see her offering something more than comic relief."<ref name="IGN Comics">{{cite web |date=2011-08-10 |title=Avengers #15 review |url=http://au.comics.ign.com/articles/118/1187342p1.html |access-date=2011-09-03 |work=[[IGN]]}}</ref>

Co-creator Will Murray has expressed interest in returning to the character: "I’ve been thinking of pitching Marvel a Squirrel Girl project. She's defeated most of the major Marvel super villains. It's time she met her match in The Ultimate Pistachio."<ref name="Jazma Online" /> Marvel's previous editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] joked, "I've always wanted to do a Squirrel Girl miniseries or a Squirrel Girl event – 'Squirrel Girl Destroys Your Nuts!' ... I haven't been able to sell it yet, but I keep on trying."<ref name="Comic book Resources">{{cite web |title=Joe Quesada Interview |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21788 |access-date=2011-09-20 |work=Comic book Resource}}</ref>
