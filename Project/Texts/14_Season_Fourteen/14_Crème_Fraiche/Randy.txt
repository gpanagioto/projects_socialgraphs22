Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time. Ugh. I'm not staying up to do ''that'' Sharon, jeez! Psseh... huh...  Oh yeah. Fuck. Mmm, God damn. Yeah. Yeah, it's fuckin' money. Aw yeah? Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah.  Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again! Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and heirloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww... No! Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!   Aw yeah, look at that. I worked all day! I can watch what I want!  ...Yeah. Whoa. See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo. Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!  Aww, stupid commercials.  Come on! Bohh-riiing.  Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm. Channel blocked?  Sharon, what are you doing? I wasn't watching food channels! I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw!  Crème fraîche. Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?  Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven? Yeah? You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan? If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan. Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing? Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah. WAH! Sharon! Hello there, children! How's it goin'?  The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great? I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche. Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli. Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah. Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.   Fraîche. Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh... Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah. Quiet on set, please.  Back from where?  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay! Talk to me?! Oh Jesus! Yes chef! No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream! Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay! Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes! Jamie Oliver!  Behind you!  I'll be right back! Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche?? I don't have time! I'm cooking right now! You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!  I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode! Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Ugh, I'm tired. Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything? I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.
