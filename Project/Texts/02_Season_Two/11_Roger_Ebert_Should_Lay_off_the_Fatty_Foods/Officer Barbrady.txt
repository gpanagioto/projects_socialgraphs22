That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys. Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up? Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong. Oh, yeah. Let's go. Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator. Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. Okay, I'll be quick, then. Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef. Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too. That would be super-duper! Oh, neato! Who? Pain.  Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?  Holdjit If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?  Odle-oh who whoo?  Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business.  Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.
