Come on. Throw the football, Ike. Hepatitis B? ...You got Raging Pussies tickets??  Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies? But all the ''guys'' are going! But Mom, I- Ugh!  My parents said I can't go.  Ah. Oh, now I already told them. No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later.  ...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair! What's Cuba? And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on? Hoh, geez.  Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.  I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!  What?? But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba! But that's not fair! You lied to me! What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?! Well I wish I didn't have any parents!  It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?! They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS! How?! What's that?  Wow! Three months without parents! Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.  "My parents molestered me." What's "bad touch"? Okay, molestered, bad touch. Cool, thanks. ...Nothing. Not one adult left?  The fatass. The mayor. Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that. Sure, outlander. I'll get it  Parents. Mom. Dad. Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone. Here's our cell phone, dude.  Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days? Did you make it to your job interview? Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are. Mom! Dad! Yeah. We're fine. But you didn't do anything to me.  But, you guys, I-- Huh. Sure.
