Oh, hey Stan.  Fine. It's kinda far, isn't it? What are you talking about? My name is "Tolkien".  Stan? You out here? Oh, okay, sorry.  Guys? Can I come in now? W-what are you guys talking about?  Oh, hey, Stan. Stan... Are you ok? You've just been acting kind of strange the last few days. Okay. Wow. Wow... Why would my parents name me something that means the only black person? Well, it's not like I really have a choice. That's why I'm here. My parents just bought the farm across the street. Yeah. Out of the blue my dad was just like, "We're going into the farming business!" And we all just picked up and moved.
