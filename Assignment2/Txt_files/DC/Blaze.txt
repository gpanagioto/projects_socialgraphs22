Blaze is involved in the creation of [[Superman]]'s enemies the [[Silver Banshee]] and Skyhook. A red-skinned demoness with horns, she disguises herself as [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] nightclub owner '''Angelica Blaze''' in order to steal souls. Superman follows her to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] to fight for the souls of [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Perry White]]'s son Jerry (who, in fact, was the son of Perry's wife Alice and [[Lex Luthor]]). Superman manages to save Jimmy Olsen, but Blaze succeeds in killing Jerry White, whose selfless sacrifice saves his soul.<ref>''Action Comics'' #655 (July 1990). DC Comics.</ref>

Satanus is the brother of the demoness Blaze. Satanus resembles a traditional demon, with large horns that protrude from the front of his head and dark red skin. He wears a heavy Roman-style helmet which buries his face in shadow. Blaze and Satanus fight each other for possession of Blaze's domain, using Superman as a pawn. Satanus has an Earthly identity and disguises himself as '''Collin Thornton''', the publisher of ''Newstime'' magazine, who had previously hired Clark Kent as editor.<ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #493 (August 1992). DC Comics.</ref>

===''Underworld Unleashed''===

===''Reign in Hell'' and afterward===
{{main|Reign in Hell}}
Blaze and Satanus are major characters in the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries.

DC Comics.</ref>

Blaze contacts [[Mary Marvel]], offering to restore her lost powers in exchange for killing [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] so that she can have his powers. Mary appears to go along with it, seemingly poisoning Freddy; however, when Blaze arrives, Freddy gets up and fights her, eventually impaling her on an iron statue and using his lightning to send her back to Hell. Now, Blaze seems to be interested in manipulating Osiris.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 2) #1 (January 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

Satanus sends the Justice League to Hell, where the League thwarts Satanus' plans to get the nine pieces of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s mask. Satanus attempts to use the mask to become all-powerful, but is prevented by [[Plastic Man]], who is possessed by the mask. The mask is then destroyed by the combined efforts of the League and [[Zauriel]] helps the League escape from Hell.<ref>''Justice League of America 80-Page Giant 2011''. DC Comics.</ref>
