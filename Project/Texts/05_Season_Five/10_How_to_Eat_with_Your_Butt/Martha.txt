 Steven! Steven, come quick! Look. It's him! It's... our son. ...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just ''knew'' the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy. Steven and I have a condition called "torsonic polarity syndrome." It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically. Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again! You're right. You're right.   Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?  Let's hurry!  Yes. Yes, I see. ...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.   The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we ''still'' don't know why.  We've tried every avenue to find him,  Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us.  Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again. Amazing. Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition.  Oh my, isn't this impressive? That's right.   Oh, I'm so happy!
