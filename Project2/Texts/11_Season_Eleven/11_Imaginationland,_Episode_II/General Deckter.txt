Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.  What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?! Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering! That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?  Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret. Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?! THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!  God-dammit, Tom. Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called "Project Imagination Doorway." According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has. They've been saying that for over forty years. Song? You didn't say anything about a song before. Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go? I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety!  All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control! All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready? Are you ready, Kurt Russell? Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard! What?! Sector Two??  Who the hell are you?! Get him out of here! Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls? All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here. Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check? Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me? What do you ''see'' in there? Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack. What? What's the matter? Kurt Russell, what's going on?! Get out of there, Kurt Russell! Talk to me! What's going on?!  Look out!  Reverse the doorway! Send it back through! He's gone, little boy. We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.
