All right, now we all want you to have a good time. But as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you. There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any ''boys'' anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt.  Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party! 
Thanks for taking the kids out tonight, Ms. Cartman. Heidi's been looking forward to it. Cheese. 
Have we already done a search of this area? Maybe she went there with her boyfriend!
