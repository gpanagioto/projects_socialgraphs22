Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned! Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.  What the hell's goin' on?! Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?  Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it! Well, let's kill it. Huh? Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it. Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight.  Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting! Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  Well, try it out! Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake. What? What is it? We just encourage them to find someplace better. Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed! Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express. Close the door!  The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical. Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!
