'''''Night Nurse''''' is a  [[comic-book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]] in the early 1970s. Linda Carter, one of the series' three central characters, previously was the lead of an earlier Marvel series, ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'', published in 1961. Carter later adopted the name Night Nurse for herself, and in this incarnation, first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #58 (May 2004), as a medical professional specializing in helping injured [[superhero]]es.

Dr. Strange: The Oath, by writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Marcos Martin, is a 2007 five part limited series that co-starred Night Nurse. 

Christine Palmer appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016) and ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'' (2022), portrayed by [[Rachel McAdams]]. Additionally, McAdams voiced an alternate timeline version in the [[Disney+]] animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021). Characteristics of Night Nurse were also amalgamated into the character [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] (portrayed by [[Rosario Dawson]]), who appeared in the [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel television series]].

==Publication history==
''Night Nurse'' was a Marvel Comics title that lasted four issues (cover-dated Nov. 1972–May 1973).<ref name="Cassell">{{cite journal|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|title= Enter the World of Danger, Drama, and Death...Night Nurse|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 95|pages= 31–35|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= April 2017|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HjW8DgAAQBAJ&q=night+nurse+daredevil+%2358&pg=PA35}}</ref> The [[medical drama]]/[[romance comics|romance]] series focused on the adventures of three female roommates who worked the night shift at the fictional Metropolitan General Hospital in [[New York City]]: Linda Carter, Georgia Jenkins, and Christine Palmer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/nightnrs.htm |title=Night Nurse |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66tWAUyPa?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/nightnrs.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2012 |access-date=July 20, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

''Night Nurse'' was one of a trio of Marvel Comics of the time that were aimed at a female audience, alongside ''[[Tigra|The Claws of the Cat]]'' and ''[[Shanna the She-Devil]]''. Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] "had the idea, and I think the names, for all three. He wanted to do some books that would have special appeal to girls. We were always looking for way to expand our franchise. My idea...was to try to get women to write them".<ref>''Alter Ego'' #70 (July 2007): Roy Thomas interview, pp. 49-50</ref>

The series was written by writer Jean Thomas, who was at the time married to Roy Thomas, and by artist [[Win Mortimer|Winslow Mortimer]].<ref name=gcd>{{gcdb series|id= 2059|title= ''Night Nurse'' (Marvel, 1972 series)}}</ref> The stories, unlike most of Marvel's offerings at the time, contain no superheroes or fantastic elements. However, the night nurses encounter "danger, drama and death", as the cover tag proclaims, as they work to foil bomb plots, expose incompetent surgeons, and confront mob hitmen. ''Night Nurse'' #4, the final issue, took place away from Metro General and New York City, instead featuring Christine embroiled in a [[gothic fiction|gothic]] adventure, complete with a foreboding mansion, dusty secret passageways, and mysterious lights.

In a 2010 interview, Jean Thomas offered her theory on the series' early cancellation: 
{{blockquote|''Night Nurse'' was an attempt to create a comics book for the same audience of young girls who read such book series as ''[[Cherry Ames]]'', ''[[Sue Barton]]'', and ''[[Nancy Drew]]''. Maybe the comic-book format just didn't appeal to that group. It may also have been difficult to distribute or display: too serious to be with [[romance comics]] but not male-action oriented enough to be with [[superhero comics]], so, regrettably, low sales led to cancellation.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Weiss|first= Brett|date= October 2010|title= Spidey Super Stories|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 44| page= 25|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref>}}

Linda Carter reappeared as a medical professional specializing in helping injured [[superhero]]es in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 2, #58 (May 2004), written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Alex Maleev]]. Matt Murdock / Daredevil refers to her then as "the night nurse ... [who is] sympathetic to ... costumed persons who get a little nicked up in ... the call of duty."<ref name="Cassell" />

''Night Nurse'' co-star Christine Palmer reappeared in ''[[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2004). Series writer [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] explained he was "a huge fan" of ''Night Nurse'', and brought back the character when he realized his first ''Nightcrawler'' story would take place in a hospital.<ref name="nc">{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5445 | title=The Winding Way Back: Sacasa Talks "Nightcrawler" | first=Dave |last=Richards | publisher=Comic Book Resources| access-date=2006-09-01}}</ref>

A [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue, ''Night Nurse'' vol. 2, #1 (July 2015), reprinted the 1970s series' four issues, as well as ''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #80 (Feb. 2006).<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/89266/ ''Night Nurse'' (Marvel, 2015 series)] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

Prior to ''Night Nurse'', writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Al Hartley]] had created the series ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'' for [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], Marvel's 1950s precursor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.netwrx1.com/CherryAmes/lindacarter.html | title=The Cherry Ames Page: Linda Carter, Student Nurse | access-date=2006-09-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907134546/http://www.netwrx1.com/CherryAmes/lindacarter.html | archive-date=2006-09-07 | url-status=dead }}</ref> It ran nine issues (Sept. 1961–Jan. 1963).<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/1483/ ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse''] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

==Characters==
While the three roommates initially bicker amongst themselves, they soon bond over their shared loneliness, and become best friends. Originally, none of the three nurses then used "night nurse" as a label, though the "Next Issue" box in ''Night Nurse #1'' promises, "More true-to-life adventures of Linda Carter, Night Nurse!"
