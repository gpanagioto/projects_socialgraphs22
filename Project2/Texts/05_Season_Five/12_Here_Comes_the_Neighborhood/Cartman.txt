 Stand by, please.  Oh, god dammit! Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature. Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS! I'll make you eat your parents! Nothing!  Aw, that is such bullcrap! No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Tolkien was able to do all that is because his family is rich! Oh, come on, Tolkien! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!  Ooooo, Armani Exchange! All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Tolkien?!  Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars. Hey, you changed your clothes, Tolkien. Not too expensive for Tolkien's rich ass family, apparently.   Oh, Jesus, dude.  What in the hell are they doing? Well, let's just play our game, then. Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny!  Kick his nutsack!  Uh huh. Yeah. Hey. Ey, you did me already!
