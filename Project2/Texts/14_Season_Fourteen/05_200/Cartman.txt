Wow, coo'...  Chocolate rules! AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew! I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad. Hey, that is Tom Cruise!  Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right? I didn't come for myself. I'm just an escort for another celebrity who wants to get in on your lawsuit... Wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money? Uh, excuse us for a second...  Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing? Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money! If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner. You're a no-good swindler and a too-good thief. We were here for money, not goo! Yeah, so what? So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves. No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez. You just had seven tacos. I'm sorry.  Why are you doing this?  Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore! No, I tried getting one last week! God, will somebody shut her up? I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time.  Let me by... Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner. My father... I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father. How could you know anything about who my family is? If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, then you'd better- Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father? I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat. I said GET. Mr. Hat! Put it on!  Do the voice. Keep... your hand... UP! By who? Goddammit, Garrison, who is my father?
