Hey, leave him alone!  Sorry, babe, I had to step in. What's up?  Eheh, stop, Eric. Thanks, babe. I don't know if you guys have heard, but right now, Denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past. They're asking for help, and I thought "why not a school fundraiser?" What? How did I say it?  When was this? Were we at Denny's?  Oh, and you kept spilling it and everything? He had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head. Then we should all come together  Hey guys. Today we're gonna start our school fundraiser. It's an idea I came up with called "Danishes for Denmark." We need everyone to do their part, so later on in the cafeteria, we are all gonna need to-  I really feel like this is the start of something new! We're gonna help Denmark, and Denmark is gonna put an end to trolls. Hello.  Buy a Danish to help stop trolling? How come nobody's stopping? Maybe this was a terrible idea. Then, all of this was... for nothing. Oh no! This was a terrible idea!  I'm so stupid! Why did I even think I could bring the boys and girls together again? 	Stop baby, no I'm not. I have an idea. I might be able to figure out the source of who trolled you last night.
