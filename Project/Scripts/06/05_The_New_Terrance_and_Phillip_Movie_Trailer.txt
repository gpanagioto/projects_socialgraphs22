Russell Crowe

[dressed as a sailor, standing on a dock] Hello, everybody. I'm Russell Crowe, and this is "Fight-in' Round The World" [puts up his fists and cycles them around]. We're gonna have lots of fun tuhday as we travel all around, and look for some good- [a man walks through his shot and Russell does a double-take, then goes after the man] Ay! What the hell do yuh think you're doin'?! [Russell's cameraman moves the camera to catch up with him] You walked right through my shot, mate! Do you know who I am?!

Man

Oh, excuse me. I was just- [Russell proceeds to beat the crap out of the man]

Russell Crowe

God-damned smartass! Do you think you could [Shelly comes in and takes the remote, changing the channel. She stops at the WD]

Stan

Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!

Shelly

Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy.

Stan

[rushes up to her] No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! [she switches back to HBC]

+++++


Russell Crowe Show.

Russell Crowe

Oh! Get up! Get up, you little pussy! [the man crawls along the dock on his belly]

Shelly

The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!

Russell Crowe (off-screen)

Oh ya like that do ya?! [punches heard]

Stan

It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!

Kyle

It's the biggest night of the year.

Shelly

[switching channels again] That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!

Stan

But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.

Shelly

No, turds!

Cartman

Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?

Shelly

Shut up, fat turd!!

Cartman

I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!

Shelly

We're not watching this! [a shot of Russell Crowe and the man]

Russell Crowe

Come on!

Man

Look, I apologize, but I was just--

Stan

But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.

Shelly

[softly, voice rising] There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!

Stan

Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!

Shelly

[glances away, then looks at Stan] All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!

Stan

[glances down, then answers] O-K, deal.

Shelly

And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! [slaps Stan twice and walks off]

Russell Crowe

Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But it looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em.

Kyle

[gathers around Stan with the other boys] Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway.

Butters

Ehyeah!

Stan

[somber] Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.

Kyle

You'd miss the new trailer?

Stan

Dude, I'm not going.

Cartman

Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? [points to Stan]

Stan

Stan.

Cartman

Stan, okay. What's your name? [points to Kyle]

Kyle

Kyle.

Cartman

Kyle. What's your name? [looks at Butters]

Butters

Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?

Cartman

Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.

Kyle

Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.

Butters

Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. [heads for the door. The other three go back to the sofa]

Russell Crowe

Seems like no one else here wants to fight.

Kyle

Dude, thank God for stupid people ["...We'll have to go somewhere else..."]

Cartman

Amen.

Russell Crowe

...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger?

Tugger

TOOOOOOT

Russell Crowe

Great idea! [runs up to the camera] Tugger thinks we should go to the faaar away country of China. [backs up towards the tug boat] China is one of the oldest civilizations on earth. And from what I understand, they LOVE a good fight! So let's go! [rushes onto the tugboat and sets off.]

Tugger

TOOOT TOOOT [a man and a woman appear]

Man with Mustache

Oh my God! It's Russell Crowe!

Russell Crowe

[taunts back] Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe! Oh my Gmah, bah bah byah byah! [gets out and heads for the man and woman] Why don't you mind your own business, you scrotum?! [punches the man. Cut to a sailing Tugger]
Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world.


Stan

Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?

Russell Crowe

[at the wheel] What a glorious day to spend a way, fight-in' round the world. [whistles and spins the boat's wheel]

Cartman

What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. [takes a hold of the remote]

Stan

They look fine to me. [another shot of Russell sailing away]

Kyle

Just don't mess with it, Cartman.

Cartman

[leaves the sofa] Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. [heads for the television]

Kyle

Just just leave it alone.

Cartman

Dude, do you wanna see the Terrance & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? [moves the cable, and the vertical goes out of whack]

Stan

That's worse!

Cartman

Okay, how about ... that? [moves it again, and the cathode ray tube pops. The wall behind the TV is blackened, and Cartman slowly peeks]

Stan

Dude!

Kyle

God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!

Cartman

[panicked] It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!

Stan

Dude, the commercials could start any time!

Cartman

I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.

Kyle

God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!

Stan

Get all the stuff! [they gather the snacks and head for the front door. Cartman opens the door and Butters arrives]

Butters

Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?

Stan

We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! [the three boys exit]

Butters

Oh Jeez. [follows]

+++++


The neighborhood. The boys run towards Kyle's house. Stan leads the way, with Kyle and Butters following.

Butters

Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez!

Stan

Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!

Cartman

[gruffly] Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!

+++++


Kyle's house, moments later. Ike is watching TV.

A Voice

[a slow drawl] ...but the Palestinian government uh is not going to see any for future- [the front door opens and the boys run in.]

Stan

Huff, huff

Butters

Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! [Kyle takes the remore and quickly changes channels, and the Russell Crowe show pops up]

Russell Crowe

And so here we are in history-rich Ch-ooina.

Kyle

We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. [the boys sit on the sofa. Ike looks at each of them angrily]

Kyle, Stan, Butters

Phew!

Ike

Hey! Imong telling Dat!

Cartman

[arrives breathless] Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.

Ike

Dadadadat!

Kyle

No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! [Ike drops down and walks away, Cartman sits next to Butters]

Russell Crowe

[hiding behind a potted shrub which he carries before him. He sets it down and look at the camera] This is Tiananmen Square. Lots of good foightin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93. [he turns back to the shrub and peers through it. The Chinese are pleasantly involved in conversations. Russell turns back to the camera] These chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. Let's see if we can get in for a closer look. [picks up the shrub and goes further into the crowd, then peers through the shrub. The Chinese notice him] Oi! [he looks back at the camera] I've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. You can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end. [turns to the shrub and jumps through it, grabbing a man's ankles] Gotcha mate! [the victimized man speaks first, then another man answers. Russell's head turns to see who's speaking, then he jumps up to challenge the second man] Ah, you wanna fight, huh?! [challenges the first] Think you could take me, you little buggers?! [punches the first man and the man sails to the ground a few feet away, knocked out cold. Blood pours from his nose. The man he lands in front of decides to fight, and soon Russell Crowe is punching men away left and right. A policeman arrives, and Russell knocks him away, too]

Cartman

God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? [Gerald arrives with Ike]

Gerald

Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.

Kyle

They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer.

Gerald

You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!

Ike

Etetheh bunlapala un night.

Kyle

But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.

Gerald

It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer.

Kyle

God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.

Stan

Aww! [the boys gather their snacks and head for the door]

Cartman

Argh!

Butters

Whoa, wait fellas. [the boys stop] We can't go to my house.

Cartman

We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.

Stan

AGH! [thinks hard, then] Wait! Chef just got a new plasma screen TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! [they leave. Ike goes back to the sofa and sits, changing the channel]

Lehrer

...taking place there all these years is sure to continue until the governments of these regions can actually come about some...

Ike

It's a birdy fly.

+++++


The neighborhood. The boys run towards Chef's house. Stan, Kyle, and Butters run past, huffing and puffing.

Cartman

[trailing again] Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!

+++++


Chef's house, moments later. The boys are at his front door, and Stan knocks.

Kyle

God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!

Chef

[answers the door in his nightgown] Oh. Hello there, children.

The Boys

[quickly] Hey Chef. [run for his sofa, leaving Chef at the door.]

Chef

Uh, how's it goin'?

+++++


Chef's living room. The boys are seated on the sofa, with Stan trying to get the remote control working.

Chef

[arrives] Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh? [a new HDTV with side speakers and settop cable box, and a rather large base] Pretty cool, ain't it?

Stan

[impatient] Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?

Chef

Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle. [Chef takes the remote and fiddles with it] I can't figure it out at all. [the program pops up immediately]

Russell Crowe

[in India] -bloomin' Taj Mahal.

Cartman

There, you got it, you got it!

Russell Crowe

[punching the natives - hits one] Freakin' Indies [hits a second] really put up a [hits a third] fight!

Stan

We made it!

Cartman

Oh, thank God.

Chef

Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be watching this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.

Cartman

We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.

Russell Crowe

[still punching Indians as they approach] Alright everyone, we're gonna take our first commercial break. But be sure not to go anywhere, because there's lot's more people to beat up!

Stan

Here they come!

Kyle

Heuh, the commercials! [some commercials air, but they're not important, as little sound is heard]

Announcer

And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!

The boys

[disappointed] Awww!

Butters

Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.

Stan

I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.

Kyle

Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.

Russell Crowe

Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world. [cut to Brooklyn, with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. A lot of brownstones here. Russell has brought his schrub with him again. He approaches the camera] Oi! Now Tugger's brought me to one of the greatest places for foightin' in North America. [backs up] Brooklyn, New York. Lots of minorities here, and they don't take kindly to whitey. [points to himself] Let's get a closer look. Come on, Tugger! [picks up his shrub and runs. Tugger hops after him, tooting along. They end up looking at a pickup basketball game in the shadow of some skyscrapers. Russell peers through the shrub, then turns to the camera] Looks like we got some black people, and some Puerto Ricans. [a quick peek] Notice the colorful rags on their heads, meaning they could be part of a gang, and therefore, [makes a fist] real used to fightin'. [peers through the shrub]

Black player

Hey, look at that guy over there. Ain't that that Gladiator guy?

Puerto Rican player

Where?

Black player

Behind that plant, next to that tugboat? [Russell peers through, but the shows his face]

Puerto Rican player

Oh yeah, I think it is.

Russell Crowe

[in condescending falsetto] Oh my God, it's the Gladiator guy! [heads for the basketball court and puts up his fists] Oh my God, I've never seen an actor before! [moves around for anyone to fight] Why don't you choke on some pig vomit, you stupid sobs!

Chef

Why can't this guy control his temper?

Russell Crowe

Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight? [knocks down a black player. Another one punches him in the back of the head] Oi! Crikey, you've done it now!

Cartman

This TV is great, Chef.

Chef

Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool features, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here- [a menu pops up on a blue screen. He presses more buttons and the default choice changes, but nothing else] No, no wait. You hit this button here [ends up at clock reset function] No, that's not it. Let's see. [presses another button] Menu... [press] Function [screen properties pop up]

Stan

Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. [looks like Russell is fighting Germans, but the menu windows block the view]

Chef

Let's see. Menu? [screen resolution, manual programming, spectrum density, profiles, audio settings, and so on pop up] Aw, dammit!

Kyle

Get it back to normal, Chef!

Chef

I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function- [still no success. The blue screen is still there] Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? [selects 'yes']

The TV

[transforms itself into a robot] Human eradication mode, active. [it rises from its base, which becomes its feet. The side speakers re-position themselves as guns, and the cable box becomes the eyes. Chef and the boys are stunned by what they just saw. The TV turns to its right and heads for the front door. It breaks through, goes down the steps, and immediately starts firing at everything in sight.]

Stan

Oh God-dammit!

Kyle

The TV left.

Butters

Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.

Stan

Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! [the four get off the sofa and head out the door. A car screeches to a halt, and the TV fires at the driver, forcing the couple inside to flee]

+++++


The neighborhood. The boys run towards the bar. Stan, Kyle, and Butters run past, huffing and puffing.

Butters

Where do we go? Where do we go?

Stan

The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!

Cartman

Aagh! God-dammit!

+++++


The bar. The boys burst through the door and head for the counter. The TV turns on to the Russell Crowe show.

Russell Crowe

[back in Brooklyn, amid the bunch of beat-up basketball players] You fight like Norwegians, ya fairies!

The Boys

Phew!

Stan

We made it.

Cartman

[blubbering] This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.

+++++


The Russell Crowe show.

Russell Crowe

These are the Florida Keys, a remote island chain just a few miles from... Oi! Wait a minute! Wasn't I just in Brooklyn fightin' minorities? What happened with that?

Tugger

Mooooot.

Russell Crowe

It's that God-damned editor! He cut the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm gonna get him!

+++++


The editing room, moments later.

Editor

Yeah. Oh I'm just working. I'm probably done around seven. [the door flies open and Russell stomps in there]

Russell Crowe

[lifts the editor up by the collar] Who the hell do you think you are?!

Editor

I'm the editor.

Russell Crowe

I know you're the bloomin' editor! I mean, who do you think you are cuttin' one of my foightin' scenes short?!

Editor

Dude, the director said to cut it.

Russell Crowe

Moy foightin' is poetry! You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you testicle! [drops him, pauses, then delivers three blows to the belly]

Jimbo

Well that guy's just plain nuts.

Barkeep

[rushes over] Hey hey hey, whoa, you kids can't be in here. [the kids are dumbstruck]

Kyle

We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!

Barkeep

You ain't midgets, your lips are too full. [the boys stay silent] Now GET OUT!!

Stan

But we have to watch the commercials in this show.

Barkeep

Look, this is a bar! We can't have children in here. People come here for debauchery and sin!

Cartman

Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.

Butters

Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!

Barkeep

GET OUT!!! [walks over and turns the TV to a baseball game]

The Boys

Aaah!

Stan

[the first to head for the door] Come on, we gotta get to a TV! [the others follow]

Cartman

Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

+++++


Downtown South Park. The TV, now a robot, marches through town blasting holes into buildings. Chef follows behind on a cell phone.

Chef

Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," then "function." [presses the buttons. The TV shoots at a man locking up a store, making him spill his groceries and fall on his back. The TV stops]

Townsman

Jesus! [gets up and runs] Waaaah! [the TV moves forward again]

Chef

No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no. [listens] Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?

+++++


Shady Acres, A Retirement Community. The boys rush in and head for the empty seats in the TV room.

Cartman

Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! [once the boys are in place, Stan walks over to the TV and turns it on. "Puppies From Around The World" comes on, and Stan quickly changes the channel to the Russell Crowe show]

Kyle

We're not too late! [the boys grin]

Russell Crowe

Come on, Tugger ol' mate. Why are you lookin' so down?

Tugger

Mooot, mooot.

Russell Crowe

[whispers to the camera] Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems his girlfriend and him had a bit of a row last night.

Tugger

Mooooot.

Old Man

[everyone watches silently, then] ...What is this?

+++++


The Russell Crowe show.

Russell Crowe

Come on. Cheer up, Tugger. How can I make you feel better? I know! [grabs a guitar off-screen and prepares to play it.] How would you like me to sing one of the songs off me new album?

Tugger

[shakes its smokestack with each protest] Nooo! Nooooo!

Russell Crowe

What's that, Tugger? You say you really love the songs on my album?

Tugger

Noooooooooo! [shakes its smokestack]

Russell Crowe

Alright then, Tugger. [begins strumming]

Tugger

Noo, no! [shakes its smokestack]

Russell Crowe

You know that you're my baby. You know I need you now.

Tugger

[tries to escape, but can't, as it's tied to the dock] Noooooooooo! [shakes its smokestack]

Russell Crowe

I don't know where I'm goin', I gotta get there some, yeah gotta get there, somehow.

Tugger

[returns and tries to rip itself away towards the right with all its might] Noooooooooo! [turns and tries to pull itself away towards the left, but can't]

Russell Crowe

Gotta get there somehow.

Tugger

[continues to struggle] Noooooooooo! [turns and tries to pull itself away towards the left, but can't]

Russell Crowe

You can stay away tonight, but I'm gonna sleep here, in my explosive clouds...

Tugger

[returns, then takes out its arms for the first time] NOOOOO! [pulls out some giant earmuffs and places them over the cabin doors. It shakes violently as Russell lunges into a faster rhythm]

Russell Crowe

SHOUT! Think I feel your heartbeat, can you feel mine... lady lookin' lovely, gotta take your love inside, gotta take it...

Tugger

[struggles fiercely] NOOOOO! NOOOOO! [throws its earmuffs off, reaches for a pistol and places it against its smokestack. Tugger fires the gun, and it falls into the water with a splash. Russell stops singing once he hears the gunshot..]

Russell Crowe

[spins around] Tugger! [drops to the edge of the dock and looks down at the water. Tugger is on its side leaking oil] Tugger shot himself!

Announcer

[the show logo pops up] Has Russell lost Tugger for good? Find out after these messages.

+++++


Shady Acres TV room.

Cartman

Here we go!

Stan

Commercial Break Number Two! [the boys are positively giddy with anticipation]

Announcer

And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!

Cartman

That's it? That's all the commercials?

Kyle

They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!

Stan

I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.

Kyle

Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retarded Russell Crowe show!

+++++


The Russell Crowe show. Russell Crowe is sobbing on a sofa in a hospital hallway.

Russell Crowe

Tugger! Why'd you do it, Tugger?! [a doctor approaches him] Doctor! Tell me how he is, doctor!

Doctor

Well, he's a very sick little tugboat.

+++++


Shady Acres TV room.

Old man

What is this? We wanna watch "Puppies From Around The World."

Old woman

Yeah. We don't like this show.

Cartman

Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!

+++++


The Russell Crowe show.

Russell Crowe

You gotta save him, Doc! Tugger! 'E's my best friend! The only friend in the world who would-

Doctor

He's going to live, but-

Russell Crowe

[lifts the doctor up by the collar] Oi! Don't you interrupt me, you vag-oina! I was givin' a heart-wrenchin' soliloquy about me feelings for Tugger!

Doctor

Sorry.

Russell Crowe

[lets the doctor down and crosses the hall to the opposite wall] Oh, Tugger! Tugger, the world won't be as bright without ya, mate! Give it to me straight, doctor! Will Tugger live?! Tell me the truth!

Doctor

...Now?

Russell Crowe

Yes, now's fine.

Doctor

Oh. Uh, your tugboat's going to be okay. He just needs an oil change and a new steamstack.

Russell Crowe

[quickly brightens and approaches the camera] Ooo, de-lolly! D'you hear that, everybody?! Tugger's gonna be okay! D'you know what that makes me feel like doin'? Foightin'! [turns around and punches the doctor out, then punches a man on crutches out, lifts him up again, and punches him out again.]

+++++


Shady Acres TV room.

Old man

This show is too violent! Put the puppies back on!

Old folks

Yeah!

Old woman 2

Please.

Cartman

Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!

Old man 2

All right, that does it! We know how to get our way! Everyone, on the count of three, release your bowels! One! Two! [everyone farts and the boys are astonished.]

The boys

[bury their noses in their jackets] Awww!

Cartman

Eewww!

Stan

Oh, God, it's horrible! [the boys leave and exit the community]

+++++


Shady Acres entrance.

Kyle

That's disgusting, dude!

Cartman

God, I hate old people!

Stan

We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!

Butters

I told you, we can't go to my house!

Cartman

And my house is being fumigated!

Stan

Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!

+++++


The neighborhood. The boys rush to Cartman's house.

Butters

Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys! ...Come on! [Cartman struggles to keep up, blubbering all the while]

+++++


Cartman's house and garage, under purple and orange tarps. The boys enter a living room filled with fumigation gas, which makes the room look foggy.

Stan

Turn it on! Turn it on!

+++++


The Russell Crowe show.

Russell Crowe

Crikey! Ol' Tugger looks healthy, happy, and [does a catcall] fit as a whistle!

+++++


Cartman's living room.

Kyle

It's okay, it's still the show.

+++++


The Russell Crowe show.

Russell Crowe

But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide made me realize that I should take up a cause. Most great actors take up causes, and I'm the greatest of 'em all! So, from now on I'm gonna spend all my spare time ...fighting cancer. [gets into a fighting stance] Right! Where is that pussy cancer anyway?!

+++++


Cartman's living room. the gas is overwhelming them, and they look ready to pass out.

Kyle

Oh, dude, I don't know how long I can take it.

Stan

Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!

Kyle

Will your sister let us watch it?

Stan

She has to! [leads the boys out of Cartman's house]

+++++


The neighborhood. The boys rush back to Stan's house.

Stan

Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!

Butters

Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...

Cartman

[trailing the other three] Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me! [stops] Oh! I lost a doughnut! [turns around and heads back] Oooh! Oh oh! [stops] Oh my God! [turns around and tries to catch up with the others] Leave no doughnut behind!

+++++


Stan's house. The boys reach the front door.

Butters

Oh Jesus! Wait.

Stan

What?

Butters

I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. [the boys are scared now. Slowly, Stan reaches up for the knob and turns it. The door flies open and a torrent of blood gushes through the door, flooding the boys back into the street.]

The boys

AAAAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh. [Kyle shakes the blood off, Stan looks up and then at the front door, Butters sits up. A trail of blood is left from the interior of the house to the street, and Shelly looks out from her window]

Shelly

I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!

Kyle

Look! Crack addicts with a television! [two men and a woman are shown watching a small TV on a box near some buildings. The boys walk up to them and watch the TV as well]

+++++


The Russell Crowe show. Russell is in a hospital room with Tugger.

Russell Crowe

Well, we couldn't find cancer, but we found a man with cancer. [he walks off and pulls in an old frail man with cancer, then delivers a blow] Take that, cancer! And that! [punches the old man again]

Tugger

Mooot Mooot! [Russell punches the old man behind the head and sends him to the floor]

Stan

The last commercial break has to be coming any second! [two phaser blasts are seen. One kills the bearded crack addict, another knocks a trash can over. Chef's TV appears and the two remaining addicts and the boys scream]

All

AAAAA! [quickly move away. Chef's TV delivers a double blast to the small TV and destroys it, then moves off to its left.]

Chef

[still following the TV and talking to customer service] ...Yes, I pressed "menu" three times! [listens] No! It's givin' me the same error message! [listens] Yes I read the instruction manual!

+++++


Luau's Toys, moments later. The boys run by.

The boys

[stopping] Where do we go?!

Kyle

Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??

Stan

We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??

Butters

I'm sure! There's no way!

Kyle

Well why not?!

Butters

Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.

Cartman

[glares at Butters and slowly gets angry] Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!

Butters

No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.

Kyle

This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!

Stan

Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! [they run off]

+++++


Butters' house, minutes later. The boys burst through the front door.

The boys

AAAAA!!

Cartman

The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! [Stan is the first to reach the remote control, so he takes it and turn on the TV]

+++++


The Russell Crowe show.

Russell Crowe

And so we'll be right back, after these commercials.

Stan

We made it! [grins]

Kyle

The last commercial break is starting!

Announcer

[the show logo appears] Don't go anywhere. Russell Crowe will be right back after a few more commercials. [the grins slowly fade to disappointment]

Cartman

These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!

Stan

Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??

Kyle

What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?

Butters

They have to show it! They promised they would!

Cartman

You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.

Kyle

That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!

Stan

Wait a minute! Look! [points and reads from the TV] "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!

+++++


The Terrance & Phillip trailer.

Announcer

[Terrance & Phillip stand back to back. The camera starts with their legs and pans up] Coming this summer! The greatest Canadian duo of all time is back.

+++++


Action music plays as the following words come flying at the viewer from the TV screen: "THIS........ SUMMER........ TERRANCE........ AND........ PHILLIP........ WILL........ BLOW........ YOU........ AWAY........ AND....... WORDS...... WILL..... FLY.... AT... YOU.. VERY. FAST" The music stops and Terrance & Phillip appear dressed as cowboys. Terrance farts, Phillip laughs, then "ASSES OF FIRE" appears with flames behind the words, then a large "2" lands next to the E in FIRE. It is set to come out June 21, 2002. It is rated R. It ends, and the boys take time to absorb it all.

Cartman

[tosses his popcorn into the air] Woohoo!!! [the popcorn showers all the boys as they begin to move around happily]

Stan, Kyle, Butters

Yeeeeesss! [begins dancing]

Stan

That looks AWEsome! [Cartman goes to the phone and starting dialing a number]

Kyle

They were wearing cowboy hats! [to Stan] Did you see?? [to Butters] Did you see?? [Butters stops dancing]

Cartman

[on the phone] Clyde, Clyde? Did you see it? [Stan jumps up on the sofa alongside Cartman] Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.

Butters

Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! [picks up some popcorn and toses it up into the air]

Cartman

You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to see.

Stan

Oh, dude, let's go!

Butters

Yeah. [the kids head for the front door]

Kyle

It looks even better than their first movie, huh?

Cartman

Yeah, it sure does!

Stan

I wonder if it's all a western?

Butters

How far away is June?

+++++


The Russell Crowe show, sunset. The sun is about to drop over the horizon behind Russell and Tugger.

Russell Crowe

Well, we sure had a good time today, didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen, a few peckers, and a lot of Colombians, to name just a few. But I sure am glad we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you? [a wallaby hops into view]

Wally B.

I'm glad to be back, Russey! [a woman and girl walk by, but stop and look]

A girl

Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe!

Russell Crowe

[in the condescending falsetto] Oh my God it's Russell Crowe! Oh my bluh blah bluh!! [gets into his fighting stance] Why don't you go flush yourself down a toilet, you cu- [the girl's mother picks her up and hurries away]

Tugger

Mooo-oooo.

Russell Crowe


[puts his hand to his ear and gasps] Uh-oh, Tugger's whistle. You know what that means!
[the wallaby hops to the boat as Russell backs away from the camera. He begins to sing as Wally B. turns around...]
Tugger's whistle's blowin'
Means we must be goin'
No more Russell Crowein' for you.
[does some boxing moves and then hops into the boat]
But now don't you start to whine
I'll see ya again next time.
'Cause there's plenty a-more a-fightin' left to do.
[Wally B. hops closer, and finally into Russell's arms. Next shot, a departing Tugger, headed for the sunset. Russell appears and sings the signature line, slowing with every word]
Makin' movies, makin' songs, an' fightin' round the world.
See you next time, everybody!
[waves to the camera]



+++++


South Park, night. Chef's TV is still walking around, but this time away from town. It's showing the Russell Crowe show. Chef is still trying to shut it down.

Chef

So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," then "enter."
