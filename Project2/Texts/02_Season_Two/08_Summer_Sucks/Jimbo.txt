Hey there, boys! How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer. What?! Oh my God!  Buckle your seat belt, Ned. México, my amigo. To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it? Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way. Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr. (Good morning, my friend. I am a spectacular American.) Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr. (I need the spectacular firework.) Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone. Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July. We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning. I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland. Fire away, we have nothing to hide. No, sir. Yes.  I mean, no! No! Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong! Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again. Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light. Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again. No.  Yes? Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again? Holy smokes! What the hell is that? Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside! ''Buenos gracias'', boys. Oh, now, why the long faces? Well, I don't think those are problems... ...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve! Careful with those, now, those are dangerous. Point 'em away from your eyes, now. Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child. Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July! Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell.
