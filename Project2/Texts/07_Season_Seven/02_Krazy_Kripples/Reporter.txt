Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand. Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now?   Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength. Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't know what is. Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now. Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom!  The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom.
