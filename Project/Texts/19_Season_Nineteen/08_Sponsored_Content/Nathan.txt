 I like apples and bananas. It hurts my feelings because I feel bad. That word makes my heart piss its pants. I'm afraid of bears.  What do you mean, Jimmy? Are you ma-ad? Oh Jimmy. So righteous, aren't you? So blind to everything that's going on. Do you really think all the changes happening to this town are just coincidence? This goes so much deeper than you can possibly imagine, Jim. Everyone's about to learn the truth. And then... There's a war coming. A war, Jim. And I'm just gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it. I like to smell trees!  Ooooh boy! I think this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
