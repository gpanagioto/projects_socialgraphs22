 Ah, hahah-uhl, oh.  Looks like our orders are actually... down. You sure you did that right? Not ordering as much? Why... what the hell is going on?  Howdy, Stephen. How've you been gettin' on? Oh, it's early mornin's and lots of hard work, but, gotta do what's best for my young 'uns. I've noticed you haven't supplied up in a while, Stephen, so I thought I'd deliver your weed to you personally. Why not? You're not gettin' all sober on us, are ya? Ohhh he, haha, hey... fuck you. My weed not good enough for ya? Something wrong with Tegridy? You're stealing my idea Stephen! Yeah-huh! While you assholes were all screwing around, I went out and made a living! When you grow your own pot, you're taking weed out of my children's mouths!  What seeds?!   Yeah, that's right! Yeah, that's right. Me too. Yeah, that's right! Yeah, that's right. Yeah! Come on! That's right. Drown babies, yeah. Drown babies, that's right. Drown babies. Tegridy.  Stupid government! How can they sit there and look a child in the face and it's fine for people to grow their own weed?! Why does it? Ugh! Am I the only person here who understands what this will do to us?! You know what? Fuck South Park! Yeah, I'm sick it! I'm just- I'm done! I don't give two shits about South Park! All that matters is Tegridy Farms now! Ah, sorry, tours at 11 and 2, and 4:20. Ohh, I told you rich, big-city folk before: You can't buy Tegridy! Yeah, I think so.  What do you want with me?  So you guys wanna team up and piggyback on the goodwill of the legalization movement for some good old-fashioned crony capitalism? I'm totally in.  Yes, Towelie. I'm working on a merger with Med Men. We have a deal in the works to help each other put a stop to home-growers once and for all. That's because I'm the president of the company, and YOU are a TOWEL! What is wrong with trying to protect our business?  I AM NOT A TOWEL! I'm not a towel!  Ah. Augh! Aaaaawwww!! Well, gang. Looks like Tegridy Farms are turning big profits again. We're on our way to becoming the biggest weed brand in the country. I'm not getting pushed around now, you got it? So go on. Anybody here wants to call me a towel, just go ahead and do it! Go on, Sharon. Call me a towel. Best towel you ever had, bitch!
