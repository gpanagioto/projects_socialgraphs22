Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland.  Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers.  Eric Cartman? Alright, and how about Stan Marsh? Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick? Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today.  I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski? Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it. Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too. I don't care! Get down here and do it!
