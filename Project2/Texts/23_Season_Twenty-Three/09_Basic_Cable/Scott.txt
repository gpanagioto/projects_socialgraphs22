Say what?? Holy shit, guys! What am I gonna do?! About Sophie Gray! She's my boo! I love her! What am I supposed to say to her. I know! That's why she's perfect! But she has diabetes. You guys always rip on me for having diabetes. No! Not this time! You guys aren't ruining Scott Malkinson's life again! I'm taking control! Do you understand?!    Hi Sophie. Hoe's it going? I have something really important to tell you, Sophie. It can't wait. So, uh, you have diabetes, right?  So... what do you wanna do now?  So... what's your favorite food... that you can't eat? Mine's waffles. Oh... Oh... Ughuh, yeah, of course. I love The Mandalorian. Yeah, like, super dog shit. She's busy!  Oh my God. I would love that. Oh. Well, uh, the thing is, I, I mean uh...  She's busy, and she's watching Mandalorian at my house!  But Dad, there's this new girl in school, and she has... diabetes! Yeah. And guess what? She wants to come over to our house! So we HAVE to get Disney+! Dad, please! This is my life! But Dad, what's wrong with people watching what they wanna watch when they wanna watch it? Unbelievable!!  You gotta help me! With my baby girl!  She's everything to me, bro, but to impress her, I have to get Disney+. How can I get it without my parents' credit card?  You once had a girlfriend, Eric. You and Heidi were together a long time. You know how important this is. What are you talking about, Eric? It- I can handle diabetes. I can handle a relationship. Ah, hey. Uuhh, Eric Cartman told me you have access to streaming accounts. No, I'm Scott Malkinson. I go to your school. Haven't you ever heard the other kids say, "I'm Scott Malkinson. I have diabetes"? Uh I'm Scott Malkinson. No, I need a Disney+ account. I have two 16-needle boxes of insulin.  Oh God.  Hi, Sophie. Me too! Oh my God, I love you so much.  Uh, uhhh, here you go. I have lots of juices standing by. O-kay!  and clicks on it. I, uh I don't know.  It, ih-it's not... working.  Oh no, not Jimmy! Bae? Bae, come back!  And Scott. And Scott! Oh, what happened to "girls are just like diabetes"?! And Scott!  You assholes, stop talking to her! I am done having you all ruin my life! You hear me?! Done! You've taken my dignity for all these years, but you are not taking my girlfriend!  Eh. You're not? But Sophie, you're totally my type! Type I diabetes!  You seem to do alright. Yeah. You don't think I'm weird and gross? Wow. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. I'm sorry you missed your show, Sophie. I don't know what happened, but somehow I feel like it's my fault.
