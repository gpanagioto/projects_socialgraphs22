 Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon. I know, right?  "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.  You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you! He's not a fag!  Kenny? And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with ''my'' camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.  Hunh! I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices! I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!  Wha, what?  What?! Fuckin' butthole! You gotta be kidding me!  So, guys! Any of you do anything ''interesting'' last night?! Really?! Nobody was playing with any ''fireworks''?!  Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Unless you ''are'' Mysterion! What?! Why? It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!  Fucking bitch...  Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
