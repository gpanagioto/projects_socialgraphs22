Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!  She's got Colonel! Oh boy! Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy? Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.    Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes? Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  I can't be dead!! No! No!! Oh my God, this can't be happening!   Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?! ...What did you say? Butters...  Butters! You can see me?? Oh my God, and you can hear me?? Because, Butters, I'm... dead.  Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you! I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides. I don't know, but you're the only one who can. Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help! Butters... Butters, you have to help me! All right, Butters, you leave me no choice.   Butters. Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me! Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven. What do you mean? I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?! Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you. This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!   Tell her, tell her that I love her.  Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!  It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted! Just the good times. I can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!  Okay, that takes care of Tolkien, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's everyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.  Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now. Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.  Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on? What else do I have to do?! Atone?  Not really... Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it. I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jews exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid. Really? I know how. Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right. Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right! I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny?  Butters. Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here. I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do! She's gonna close soon! Come on!  Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time! I told you, Butters.  Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day! All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages. Don't worry. I have a plan.  They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead.  Yes, it's working!  Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day. My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends. We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.   You sonofabitch Butters! You told me I was a ghost! How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to
