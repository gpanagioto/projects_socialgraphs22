==Fictional character biography==
===Original version===
The original model (simply known as the Adaptoid) debuted in the ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' title, being created by the criminal scientific organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=118}}</ref> An [[Android (robot)|android]] containing a [[wikt:shard|shard]] of the [[Cosmic Cube]] [[Magic item|artifact]], the Adaptoid is programmed to defeat the hero [[Captain America]], infiltrating the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' [[Avengers Mansion|headquarters]] while impersonating various characters (such as [[Edwin Jarvis]] and [[Bucky Barnes]]), and then copies the stand-out fighting abilities and respective traits of several Avengers ([[Hank Pym|Goliath]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and the [[Wasp (character)|Wasp]]) as the "Super-Adaptoid". After a long battle, the android flees after incorrectly believing that Captain America had been killed.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #82 - 84 (October - December 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=332}}</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid then took refuge underground near the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute For Higher Learning]] and was unintentionally awakened by an optic blast from [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]]. The Adaptoid left his hideout and saw the [[X-Men]] in their civilian clothes ice skating. He then recalls that he had another mission: to transform others into Adaptoids like himself, so he begins his attempt with the [[X-Men]]. They refused and a fight broke out. As the battle dragged on, [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] (having just been asked to leave the X-Men) watched from a distance and saw how powerful the Adaptoid was. The Adaptoid soon defeated the X-Men, and was then approached by Mimic, who offered to become an Adaptoid. During the process, Mimic had a change of heart when learning of having no free will and the two began to fight. During the battle, the Adaptoid tried to copy the powers that Mimic had copied from the X-Men and failed. Mimic then devised a plan and tried to mimic the Adaptoid's abilities, causing huge feedback which made both of them lose their powers. As Mimic was rescued by his fellow X-Men, the Adaptoid fell to a river below.<ref>''X-Men'' #29 (February 1967). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid later attacks Captain America during a charity event involving the Avengers, after copying the abilities/powers of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. He is tricked into using all his powers at once, overloading himself.<ref>''Avengers'' #45 (October 1967). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Adaptoid was featured in the ''Iron Man'' title reactivated by Jarr and Tyrr as a servant. After a battle where Iron Man defeated the Adaptoid, the android evolved into the metal-based '''Cyborg-Sinister''', attacking [[Stark Industries]] which resulted in another confrontation with Iron Man which ended with the android being seemingly destroyed.<ref>''Iron Man'' #49 - 51 (August - October 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Adaptoid reforms in the ''Captain Marvel'' title, and after a brief battle with Iron Man follows the hero to Avengers Mansion, where the character battles the team and [[Kree]] ally Captain Marvel. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]] tricks the Adaptoid into copying nega-bands, which act as a portal to the alternate [[Negative Zone]] dimension. By striking the Adaptoid's nega-bands together, Mar-Vell banishes the character to the Negative Zone indefinitely.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #50 (June 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid is retrieved in the ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' title, and used unsuccessfully by villains [[Annihilus]] and [[Blastaar]] against the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]] and the Avengers in the Negative Zone.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #75 (May 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Adaptoid reappears in the ''Avengers'' title. Revealed to be stored at Avengers Mansion when a [[Masters of Evil|group of supervillains]] attacked, the Adaptoid disguises himself as the [[Fixer (Marvel Comics)|Fixer]], overpowering and changing places with his victim to be the android's former confinement tube at [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]].<ref>''Avengers'' #277 (March 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Adaptoid then replicates [[Mentallo]]'s powers. Uniting a [[Heavy Metal (Marvel Comics)|team of artificial beings]] (the [[Awesome Android]], [[Machine Man]], the [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry-459]] and [[TESS-One]]), the Adaptoid directs them against the Avengers. While the heroes are distracted, the Adaptoid summons the entity [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]] to Earth, so that the character can copy the sentient's powers and become the all-powerful '''Supreme Adaptoid''' that can now reproduce itself. Although successful, the android is ultimately tricked into shutting down by Captain America and its Cosmic Cube shard is removed by Kubik.<ref>''Avengers'' #286 - 290 (December 1987 - April 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Super-Adaptoid makes a brief appearance during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' storyline having a confrontation with the [[Fantastic Four]] ([[Mister Fantastic]], the [[Invisible Woman]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]]),<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #336 (January 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> and in the ''Heroes for Hire'' title, where the android has an encounter with the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] (a.k.a. the disguised [[Masters of Evil]] consisting of [[Helmut Zemo]], [[Abner Jenkins|Mach-I]], [[Erik Josten|Atlas]], [[Karla Sofen]], Techno and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]]) and the [[Heroes for Hire]],<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7 and 10 (January and April 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> and the ''Hulk'' title where scientist [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] is [[blackmail]]ed into being involved with the Adaptoid's repair and activation.<ref>''Hulk'' #469 (October 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The android poses as "'''Alessandro Brannex'''" during various titles. With [[MODAM]] as an enforcer, Alessandro was the C.E.O. of the terrorist organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] on the Boca Caliente island country.<ref>''Quasar'' #9 (April 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> While making A.I.M. into a public friendly company, Brannex tries to personally show Captain America of this legal change,<ref>''Captain America'' #387 (July 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> and tries to get rid of Iron Man to finish a potential nuclear weapons deal.<ref>''Iron Man'' #296 - 297 (September - October 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> His impersonation is revealed during [[Superia]]'s assassination to which the Adaptoid regenerated itself.<ref>''Captain America'' #412 - 413 (February - March 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> On the Adaptoid-inhabited Boca Caliente, Alessandro's A.I.M. fraction is behind [[MODOK]]'s resurrection. The Adaptoid personally reveals itself during a confrontation with the [[Red Skull]] but is caught in the recreated Cosmic Cube's reality-warping ability and is presumed destroyed.<ref name="Ca440-441">''Captain America'' #440 - 441 (June - July 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="Av387-388">''Avengers'' #387 - 388 (June - July 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Super-Adaptoid appears in the limited series ''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'', and is revealed to be a warrior in the employ of the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien race]] under [[Ultron]]'s control. Claiming he left Earth after becoming disgusted with humanity's chaotic nature, the Adaptoid attempts to destroy [[Phyla-Vell]], [[Moondragon]] and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'' #1 - 4 (July - October 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" event, the Super-Adaptoid appears as a member of the [[A.I. Army]].<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Other models===
Another model was provided as a field agent of a [[New Enforcers|villainous group]] against [[Spider-Man]]. This Adaptoid is ultimately used by the crime boss the [[Richard Fisk|Blood Rose]] intentionally to affect the other mechanical teammates.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #99 - 100 (April â€“ May 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> '''Batch 13''' was an Adaptoid in A.I.M.'s possession. Breaking out of its containment unit and escaping to [[New York City]], it copied the various powers/abilities of Captain America and the [[Fantastic Force]]. As it was imitating powers, Batch 13 began to have a psychic breakdown after copying Psi-Lord's psycho armor. As a result, Huntara conjured up a portal to send Batch 13 into.<ref>''Fantastic Force'' #4 (February 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> Several Adaptoids can be seen on Boca Caliente, fooling several Avengers (the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]] and Hercules). During the Cosmic Cube recreation, an Adaptoid (having been impressed by Captain America's heroic nature) ended the threat by willingly transforming itself into a non-sentient containment chamber for the reality-warping energies.<ref name="Ca440-441" /><ref name="Av387-388" /> An '''Ultra-Adaptoid''' appears in the limited series ''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11''. Created by A.I.M. to infiltrate [[MODOK]]'s group of supervillains, the character has no independent will and is remotely controlled. Courtesy of a [[satellite]] relay, the Ultra-Adaptoid has access to dozens of powers, but is eventually destroyed when released from A.I.M. control.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's Eleven'' #1 - 4 (September - December 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> Adaptoids from an alternate reality are used by the [[Andrew Forson|Scientist Supreme]] to combat the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #25 - 28 (January - April 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Other identity users===
The terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] have [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]] as a Super-Adaptoid to battle the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. A fusion of human and machine, she managed to copy the New Avengers' various powers. She is eventually defeated when the powers "copied" from the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] cause her the same [[psychological]] problems. HYDRA then destroys her via a remote-controlled self-destruct device.<ref name="NAA1">''New Avengers Annual'' #1 (June 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Norman Osborn]] is given the Super-Adaptoid abilities by his [[H.A.M.M.E.R.|followers]] to replace his lack of the [[Iron Patriot]] armor and his disinclination to return to his old [[Green Goblin]] role, absorbing the powers of the Avengers, the New Avengers, and his [[Dark Avengers|personal group]]. He is defeated when the Avengers and the New Avengers struck him all at once, the multiple powers working against each other and causing him to collapse into a coma.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #24 (May 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The original iteration is an artificial construct created by A.I.M., and courtesy of a shard of the [[Cosmic Cube]] artifact, the machine was capable of mimicking the powers and skills of numerous super beings. It has mimicked over a dozen meta-human characters, with the effect extending to including specific weapons and equipment, such as [[Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]], [[Iron Man]]'s [[Iron Man's armor|armor]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]'s bow and arrows, and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The Super-Adaptoid possesses exceptional artificial intelligence, but limited imagination and an inability to understand the human condition has led to defeat. The shard was eventually removed by the cosmic entity [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]].<ref>''Avengers'' #290 (April 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> The two later versions, while capable of mimicking multiple foes, have been defeated when attacked by groups of meta-humans simultaneously, being unable to process the sudden surge in information.<ref name="NAA1" /><ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #23 (April 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===2099===
The Super-Adaptoid, having been inert for decades, reactivates in [[Marvel 2099|2099]]. It becomes a version of the future [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] called [[Flipside (comics)|Flipside]].<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #29 - 30 (March - April 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===
The Super-Adaptoid appeared in Franklin Richards's [[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]] universe as a device used by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] but is defeated by the Avengers. Since its defeat, it gains [[sentience]] as '''Amazo-Maxi-Woman''', joining the heroes' quest to stop [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 2 #11 (September 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Spider-Gwen''===
In ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'', which takes place on Earth-65, the Super-Adaptoid is known as '''Project Green''' and is a member of the S.I.L.K. organization.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' vol. 2 #7 (June 2016). Marvel Comics.</ref>
