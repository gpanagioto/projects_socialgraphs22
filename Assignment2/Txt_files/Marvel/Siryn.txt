'''Theresa Maeve Rourke Cassidy''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Debuting under the codename '''Siryn''', she later retired the name and went by '''Banshee''', in honor of her late father, [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]], who first used the alias.

Like her father, the X-Men's [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Theresa is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses a "sonic scream" that can incapacitate and injure an opponent's hearing, or send powerful vibrations through the air, the latter of which she can use to fly. Her name refers to the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] of [[Greek mythology]].

Theresa was raised by Banshee's cousin and nemesis [[Black Tom Cassidy]] without Banshee's knowledge. By her early teens, she left Black Tom and eventually joined the X-Men offshoots [[X-Force]] and later [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]].

==Publication history==
Siryn was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Steve Leialoha]], and first appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'' #37 (April 1981) as a villain.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=335}}</ref> Along with many young mutants at the time such as [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Multiple Man]], she featured in the limited series ''[[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]]'' (1987). She was one of the first members of ''[[X-Force]]'' (vol. 1) (1991), beginning in issue #3, and remained a regular in that book until issue #100 (2000). As a love interest of [[Deadpool]], she concurrently appeared in one of his earliest solo titlesâ€”''Deadpool: Sins of the Past'' (1994), and sporadically appeared in ''Deadpool'' (vol. 1) (1997) and ''[[Cable and Deadpool]]'' (vol. 1) (2005).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
While Sean Cassidy was working on a deep undercover mission for [[Interpol]], his wife Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa, at Cassidy Keep, County Mayo, Ireland. Maeve later dies in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing, and with no means to contact Sean, his cousin [[Black Tom Cassidy|Tom]] takes care of Theresa. When Sean returns and learns of his wife's death, he is devastated. Before Tom can tell him about Theresa, Sean lashes out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. As Sean flies away in anger, Tom falls into a chasm and breaks his leg, leaving him with a limp. Tom swears to make Sean pay and vows to never tell him about his daughter, and raises her himself.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #31 Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tom (now known as Black Tom) trains Theresa as his apprentice in his criminal activities. As a young teen, she accompanies him and his then-partner, the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. She takes the name Siryn, aids them in a [[vibranium]] theft, and battles the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Due to her inexperience, she performs poorly in battle and is defeated by Spider-Woman again during Black Tom's temporary capture. Initially believing her to be seriously hurt, Black Tom resolves to break all association with her so that she will not be exposed to further danger. While in custody, he absolves Theresa of all responsibility for her crimes,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #38 Marvel Comics.</ref> and writes a letter to Sean explaining who she is. The X-Men bring Theresa back to their headquarters, where she is joyfully reunited with her father.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]]. ''Uncanny X-Men'' #148 Marvel Comics.</ref>

Deadpool and Siryn become involved when the two fight Black Tom Cassidy and the Juggernaut. Although Banshee warns Siryn that Deadpool is a madman and a murderer, she finds Deadpool attractive, and the feelings are reciprocated.

She assists him in some of his missions, such as when Deadpool felt he needed some blood from the [[Hulk]] in order to cure problems with his own healing powers.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> In the end Siryn becomes overwhelmed with balancing her duties with X-Force and the demands of Deadpool's mental health. She promises him that she would consider progressing their relationship if he continues on the path of good, and once she has her X-Force responsibilities secured. Warpath continues to seek Siryn's affections, and makes his dislike for Deadpool clear during a visit to the baseball diamond used in the movie ''[[Field of Dreams]]''.<ref>''Deadpool'' (vol. 3) #12.

Marvel Comics.</ref> but they both escape and return the children to their grandparents.

The girl attempts to send the Morrigan back but she ignores the girl and takes Theresa, furious that she has been using the name Banshee, one of the many names associated with the Morrigan. The Morrigan takes Theresa to a lighthouse and offers her a choice: apologize and worship her, or die.

Theresa and Layla attempt to summon the Morrigan but Theresa is teleported to Ireland instead. During the confrontation, Theresa asks if the Morrigan can heal Lorna but the Morrigan advises her she cannot, as Lorna does not believe in her. The Morrigan reveals she is tired of being a goddess and misses her own father; if Theresa wants to help Lorna, she must become the Morrigan. Theresa agrees and hurls a sonic lance through the Morrigan, killing her. In that moment, Lorna is completely healed of her insanity. Theresa teleports back to headquarters, appearing before Jamie as the Morrigan and telling him goodbye. Theresa lets him know she never stopped loving him and if he needs her, all he has to do is pray before departing.<ref name="XFactorV3#244"/>

After Jamie is transformed into a demon, he takes her up on this offer so she rescues  and transforms him back into human form. She then asks the now-married Madrox and Layla if they want to reform the team but, they decline saying that they have a farm to start up and a baby on the way.<ref>David, Peter (w). ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #262. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===House of X===

''House of X'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Siryn is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses sonic powers similar to those of her father, Banshee, although she is able to use her powers in ways that Banshee could not. Like her father, she has the ability to emit high-decibel "sonic screams" to create various sonic effects with her vocal cords. She can vary the pitch to deflect [[projectile]]s. She possesses an enhanced sense of hearing and can use her voice to detect objects via [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]. While screaming, Siryn is able to fly at the speed of sound. She has potent sonic attacks that can shatter objects; project concussive blasts of sonic force (a "sonic lance"); and cause immediate pain, nausea/vomiting, and unconsciousness. She has shown a degree of resistance to sounds and vibrations that would be harmful or painful to normal humans and mutants without sonic-based powers.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #30 Marvel Comics.</ref> She possesses psionic powers to create a force field that protects her against her own sonic vibrations, assists her ability to fly, and directs her sonic powers.

She is vulnerable to losing her power by overstraining and overusing her sonic screams or injury to her throat and [[vocal folds|vocal cords]].<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #90 Marvel Comics.</ref> She lacks fine control of her abilities when in extreme distress: for example, when she screamed in pain during her pregnancy, she unwillingly shattered every window in the complex and caused the medical staff to writhe in agony.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor #39 Marvel Comics. (2009)</ref>

Unlike her father, Siryn is able to influence and control other human beings with her sonics, and cause them to enter a [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] state. Siryn can cause the intended person to fall in love with her without regard to gender or sexual orientation and carry out her wishes and commands, like mythical [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]].<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #1. Marvel Comics. January 2006</ref> Siryn once used this ability on [[Spider-Man]], forcing him to divulge the truth about the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] of the mutants.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #8. Marvel Comics. August 2006</ref>

In addition, she can prevent others from hearing external sounds by a certain vocal pitch so that she can secretly deliver messages to them.<ref>''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Theresa becomes the Morrigan, she gains numerous undefined mystical abilities. Her known powers include the ability to teleport by her own free will or to people who summon her using the correct ritual, heal her followers and people with a personal bond to her, and some form of immortality or longevity.<ref name="XFactorV3#244"/> She is able to revert Jamie to his human form and absorb laser blasts from a gun that can destroy Layla Miller's force field.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' Vol. 3 #262. Marvel Comics.</ref>
