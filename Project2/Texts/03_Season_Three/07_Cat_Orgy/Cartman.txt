 Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek! Are you okay, Salma Hayek? Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!   But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West. But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek. No, Kitty! I don't have anything! What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty! No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty!   Uh-huh.  Right. Aw, Ma.   Ow! You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV?  You're not allowed to have people over! This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!   Ey! I need to use the phone! Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah!    Ey, I was watching ''Aliens'' on TV! Who the hell are you? You know this guy? Christ, he's like 50 years old! Dude, that's not cool. Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit! Hey, what are you doing?  I'm gonna tell my mom on you. Ey! You ate all the pizza! That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass!  Give me that phone number!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over. God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip.  Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip.   Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now! Aaaaa!  Yes! I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home! You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can ''prove'' you had a boyfriend over heuh!  Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Oh! God dammit! Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!  You just want me to open the door! What?? Ih- is she okay? Huh?!  A''ha!'' I ''knew'' it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture! Haa''ha!'' I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it! O-kay! Let's see heuh. Ha''ha!'' Um... Aw, dammit!  Aw, man, you guys suck. You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!  Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head! Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh!  Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over! Well, there's a whole crappy band here!   Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?! I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here!  My Speak and Record bear. Of course.  Okay. See you in a while. Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly. Well, I just, I kind of like having you around. No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could ''pretend'' like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, ''we'' could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day. Yuh, you mean it? Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.  Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother ''is'' away at a party right now. That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve. I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh? I'm sorry. Did ''you'' say something, Skyler?  Agh! Gotcha!  Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway? You're not ugly. Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls? Weh-hull, I ''could'' ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know. If you want, I could help you. Just let me get my cowboy hat.  We don't have much time! Hurry up in there! That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face! Oh my God!  You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!  Uh oh. Yeah. I think we get along okay. Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat! Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush. That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West.
