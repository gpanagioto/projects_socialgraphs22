Butters, what the hell are you doing? Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax! There's nothing you ''can'' do except stop breathing.  Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'. Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan! We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return!  Do you have some scissors to get this open? Well alright.  We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back. Oh, it's just a goat.   Hey there, little guy. I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars. Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle. Kenny? ''My'' parents will ''never'' let ''me'' keep a goat No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please? They're not. Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them.  I don't care! We're going! Okay, thanks, Towelie.  Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!  Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.  Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.  Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions. 'K, let's put him on here.   Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours. Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan. Twenty hours!  Hey look! There's a taxi!   I think so.  A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat? Here. Wu-we don't want it. No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat. Oh uh, and here.  Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America. Hey! Hey, open the door! How come they hate America so much? What the hell did ''we'' do? Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad. What?   You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies!  Dude, these people are insane. Hey, what are you guys doing here? Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war. But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?  ...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes! ...He's got us there, dude.  Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all. Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too. Come on, let's go get to the plane.  No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.  Go America.  Yeah, go Broncos.
