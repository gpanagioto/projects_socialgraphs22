 Saddam... No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now. I love you too, Saddam. If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris.   Saddam, I'm just here to talk. Saddam, I only came here because I need closure. No! Saddam, listen to me. Um, maybe just... a little one.  What is this? Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now.  Saddam...   Oh God, what time is it? I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris. No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation!  Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes.  Hi, Chris.  Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina.   What?  Oh, n-no! I know.  Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say "If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!" or, or "I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!" or something? Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake.   Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!  No! Not like this..!  Oooyeah! Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh...  Chris!  But I thought you were dead! Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in-- Uh... yeah. Gr-great. And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really ''nice'' to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all. I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer. Who?  God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years. Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by. Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around? Great. Thanks.   Hi, God. Yeah. No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice. No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein,  was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April... ...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick. Huh? Well, I just don't know which one to pick. God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself. Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes. You too. Uh, no, I need to be getting back. Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really gotta go.  Guys, guys, guys!  Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision. Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you. Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the ''lover'' I want.  No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!  Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.  Awgh... Not again. Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore! Yes, I can! '''''Raaarrr!'''''  Goodbye forever, Saddam! Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.
