Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay? I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing That's probably gluten, m'kay? Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems, See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off. Then eat it! If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay? Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off.
