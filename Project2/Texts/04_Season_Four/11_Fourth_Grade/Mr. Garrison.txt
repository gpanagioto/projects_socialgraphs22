 Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!! Who-? Who are you? What do you want?  Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....? No, I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang! ...Two hundred bucks. Alright, let's try it again. "But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems." "Well, I'm not ''gong' '' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!" NOOO! Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, "Suck my balls," you say, "Present them." Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.  You will be. This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside. Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.  Haaa! Who? Who are ''you''?  I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!  Yeah, it feels really good! You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!
