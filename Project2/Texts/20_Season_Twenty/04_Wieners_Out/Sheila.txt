Gerald, you've been sitting at the table for three hours now. You okay? Not at all, Gerald. I'm sorry. Well! I know you said your computer was broken. So, I went ahead and got you something.  Here, it's your own iPad.  You don't like it? Gerald,  what's going on? Okay, Gerald. I'll make us some lunch.  Oh uh, did that guy outside talk to you?  You don't have to work tonight? Wow! I don't remember the last time you were able to get in bed the same time as me. Hey, I'm not complaining.  It feels good to have you here.  Gerald?   One night you, you say all of our computer stuff is broken and you, you hide everything and then you show up with all of this new equipment and now this! Please, tell me what's going on! . But I know you watch porn. You told me you watched porn and I told you that I don't care, Gerald. Why?! Because it's not normal porn? Like something really embarrassing? Tell me! Piss porn? Like people peeing on each other? Do you want me to pee on you? You only like watching other women pee?  Because they're pretty? You have to watch around a video because I'm overweight and old? You do, promise?  Am I doing it right, Gerald?
