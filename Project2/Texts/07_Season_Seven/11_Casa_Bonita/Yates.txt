All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him. All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him. Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters.  I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts!  All right, kid! End of the line! Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?
