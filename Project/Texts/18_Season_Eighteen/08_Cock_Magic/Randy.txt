Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous! It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college. Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely.  Oh? Not impressed? How about this?   Hey! Oh! Oh thank you! Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey! All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback. Oh yehhs yesyesyesyesyesyes, Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college. Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer. People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Hey kids, are we having fun?   Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please! Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!   Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody? Alright, come on up here.  What's your name? All right, a hand for Detective Harris!
