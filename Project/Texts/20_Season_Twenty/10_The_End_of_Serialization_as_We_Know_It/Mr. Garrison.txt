Iah-uhk-uh-I cain't?  A cyber attack, well that's good! Where's it comin' from? Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected. Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll. Kyle?! Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?! Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you. Keep up the good work. We're gonna take that big shitstorm of hate you're creating and amplify it. We'll try to create enough energy to blow up the whole fucking internet.  You're doing God's work, son. Keep it up. Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good.  Sorry, Kyle. Looks like its not going to work. SpaceX? What the fuck is that? Okay, that's dumb, but go on. Reroute the internet through SpaceX!.
