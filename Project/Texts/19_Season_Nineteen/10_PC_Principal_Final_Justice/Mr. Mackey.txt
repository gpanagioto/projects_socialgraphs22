 Nobody move! Okay?! Everyone just stay where you are! Yes, I wanted Principal Victoria fired! But I didn't want any of this! Eighteen years of answerin' to you! EIGHTEEN YEARS! Of you always... tellin' me what to do! You never listen!! Nobody listens to me! They just expect me to listen to them! I don't know, maybe I got manipulated by these ads too somehow but, I should have been a better person!
