Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you. First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. "Hey,  cutie."  Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck.  Go ahead and open for business, Porsche! Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you? Great.   
 Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else. Why not? Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing. I think his name was...  Leopold... Stotch or something? A tragedy? Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.  Stan. Stan, we have a big problem! It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle. He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor. 
Are you gonna be in the bike parade?
