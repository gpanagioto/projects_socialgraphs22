Oh, you knight.   Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you. What's the problem?  Hello, children! Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie. Huh? A what?  Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?  Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand? Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow,   Children! That hurts my feelings. I do! ''There's got to be a morning after. [the needle is removed and there's no more music]'' ''I'll'' take care of them!   Aaargh! Noooo!
