We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree! Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub? Because our names were called on the commercial last night! We've gotta find that ticket! Where's Kenny??  Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.  Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there! I can't see.  It was a trick! Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot! We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over!  Cartman, come on! Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!  We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven. Because we wanna see Kenny again.  Mr. Garrison threw away his car? Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it! Excuse me.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with. We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood. No. Hello?? Kenny?? God?? No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off. What?? Hey Kenny. Dude, what the hell is wrong with you?? Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree. No, we have to see Kenny! Cremated? What's that? Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny! Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny!  Where?? Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta ''spark'' the vision somehow. Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?! Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done.  Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels... Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body. Dude, come back here!
