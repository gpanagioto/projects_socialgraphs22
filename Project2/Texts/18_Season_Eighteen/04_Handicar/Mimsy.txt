D'awww, we don't like camp, boss? D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark.  D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss? D'oh boy! Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace? Aw yeah, don't mind me. D'uh I don't know, boss. D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr. D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em? D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss? D'ah oh boy!  D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss. D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. Ah "I drove a Lincoln way before I got paid to drive one." Drrrr.  D'ah, it's an analogy.  D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss? D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel?  Shut up, Mimsy!  Yeah? D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!
