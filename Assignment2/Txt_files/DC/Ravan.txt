'''Ravan''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[villain]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #1 (1987), and was created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Luke McDonnell]].

==Publication history==
Ravan first appears as a member of the villainous mercenary team [[Onslaught (DC Comics)|Jihad]] (renamed the Onslaught later). In an encounter with the [[Bronze Tiger]] his back was broken.<ref>''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #1</ref> He re-appears alongside the Onslaught in ''Suicide Squad'' #17, and is recruited for the Suicide Squad in his second encounter with the Bronze Tiger.<ref name="Suicide Squad #18">''Suicide Squad'' #18</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Part of the [[thuggee]] cult, handsome Indian playboy Ravan tries to stop the coming of Kali and thereby the [[Kali Yuga]], the Age of Chaos, by killing for Kali. In doing so, he delays the coming of Kali for another thousand years. It is through this practice that he both prevents and worships [[Kali]]. His primary enemy is the villain [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]], who wishes to bring forth the Age of Chaos.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #1, #33</ref>
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ravan2.jpg|thumb|247px|left|[[Amanda Waller]] briefs the Squad on Ravan.]] -->
Ravan joins the Suicide Squad so he can continue these efforts while actually being sponsored by the American government.<ref name="Suicide Squad #18"/> He proceeds to develop a strange bond with Bronze Tiger, whom he swears to kill for his earlier defeats, but the two also form an effective team. During the [[Janus Directive]], when Waller must make it seem like she is being controlled by Kobra, she sends the squad after the [[Outsiders (comics)#Enemies|Force of July]]; Ravan kills Mayflower, a respected member of the Force of July.

Ravan becomes instrumental in Amanda Waller's plan to finish off the LOA, a drug-dealing organization. The villains' plan to expose the Squad succeeds, and it is revealed that Mr. Kale, who was seemingly the new boss, was just a front for Amanda Waller who had never left power.<ref name="Suicide Squad vol. 1 #37-39">''Suicide Squad'' #37-39</ref>

With her superiors on the verge of disbanding the Suicide Squad, Amanda Waller gathers Ravan, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Deadshot]] in an assassination mission targeting the LOA, which is planning to create a zombie army. The deal for the villains is simple: the three will help Waller in killing the LOA and afterward they are set free.<ref name="Suicide Squad vol. 1 #37-39"/>

The mission succeeds, and Amanda Waller goes to jail on charges of murder, while Ravan leaves for London, where he sets up a 'cyberchurch' as a front for his assassination organization. A year later, Batman kidnaps Ravan from this 'church' (blowing it up in the process) for the new Suicide Squad, again run by Amanda Waller.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #41-43</ref>

With this Squad, Ravan goes to Israel in order to capture Kobra, but Kobra has already been captured by the Israeli government's superteam the [[Hayoth]]. Ravan easily manipulates one of their agents, thereby giving him access to their highly advanced [[Artificial Intelligence|A.I.]] computer Dybbuk. While Kobra's plans are being thwarted by the rest of the Suicide Squad, Ravan faces Kobra in combat, but Kobra has the upper hand and is close to killing Ravan.

At the last moment, [[Atom (comics)#Adam Cray|the third Atom]] appears on the scenes, striking down Kobra. Ravan's last wish is for either him or the Atom to kill Kobra, but Atom denies him that final wish, and as Ravan himself says, he dies unfulfilled in ''Suicide Squad'' #47.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #45-47</ref> According to ''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 2) #11, however, Ravan is incapacitated rather than deceased, as is shown on a computer screen being viewed by the second Rustam. Assuming this is true, Ravan nevertheless dies for certain sometime thereafter, though the details are not currently known.

During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Ravan's corpse is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 3) #67 (January 2010)</ref> Ravan is apparently destroyed by the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunter]]'s self-destruct mechanism when it unleashes an explosion of [[Green Lantern]] energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #18 (February 2010)</ref>

==Other versions==
A character named '''Ravan Nassar''' appears in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' Season 2.5 Comics: "Haunted", "Gone", Blood part 11 and 12 and "Assault".<ref>''Arrow: Season 2.5'' #3</ref> In 2012, [[Kahndaq]] was liberated by [[A.R.G.U.S.]] and a multitude of soldiers, leading to the imprisonment of Ravan at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and a lot of sectarian violence. Two years later, an extremist sect named [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] began kidnapping and murdering, leading to [[Lyla Michaels]] asking Ravan to join the [[Suicide Squad]]. Ravan was cleaned up and given clothes and weapons. As they were ready to leave, [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] showed up to join them. As they were preparing to drop above the Sinai Peninsula, Diggle questioned Nassar as to what piqued his interest in the mission, considering the nature of the others' membership, being chided for his previous actions as the country's head of military. Once on the ground, they snuck in to the nearby city. They ambushed extremists in the midst of an execution and Ravan, contrary to their initial plans, planted an IED device on one of their trucks, leaving only one, badly-burnt survivor. They took him to a house, tying him up and interrogating him. They requested to know where the resistance leader [[Black Adam|Khem-Adam]] was, but he claimed to have no idea. He refused to give up the location, until Diggle intervened, instead talking to him rather than torturing. Being told the Amon-Shu Caves, they rode on camelback, finishing the journey on foot. They broke through in to the caves, fighting off Khem-Adam and his men. However, before Nassar could take on Khem-Adam, a former soldier under his command, he was stopped by two arrows from [[Nyssa al Ghul]], who took Khem-Adam. With [[Bronze Tiger]] killed, they escaped to return home. Ravan was returned to his cell at Guantanamo Bay, believing that he had to pay for his past crimes.

In the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' reality, Ravan is a prisoner in the underwater facility called The Trench.<ref>''Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year Four'' Annual #1</ref>

==In other media==
* Ravan makes his live action cameo in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' season 2 episode "Unthinkable" as an A.R.G.U.S. Squad Reserve, played by Viv Leacock.
