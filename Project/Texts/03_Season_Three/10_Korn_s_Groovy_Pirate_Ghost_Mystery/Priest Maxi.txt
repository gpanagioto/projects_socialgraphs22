Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh! KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil! I ''know'' who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!  When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get! Whoa!   Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band! Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday! No.
