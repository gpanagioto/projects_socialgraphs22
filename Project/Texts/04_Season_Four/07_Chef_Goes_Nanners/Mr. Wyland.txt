Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club. I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of ''all'' your debates so far has been... Cartman. Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, ''I'' want you all to go out and ''re''search this debate be''fore'' we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on.  Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed. Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the "Flag Should Stay The Way It Is" team? Alright. Stan and Kyle,  Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate! Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club.  Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point?  What?
