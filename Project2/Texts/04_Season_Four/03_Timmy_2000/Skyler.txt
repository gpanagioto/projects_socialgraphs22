Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!  Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?! We've just gotta practice more. Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top!  Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa! You a singer, man? Yeah! 1 2 3 4   Wooo!! Yes! I'm a rocker!   Yeah? Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla. Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run.   Huh? Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.  Uh, thanks man. See ya.  Yeah. All of them chanting "Timmy, Timmy." The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy. And the Lords of the Underworld! It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!  I'm goin' solo!   They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.  I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head...  What do you say, Timmy?
