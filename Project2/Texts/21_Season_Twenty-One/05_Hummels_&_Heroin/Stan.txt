Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa? It's just some Hummels. Grandpa?  That's what the guy gave me. Aw, come on, Grandpa. Isn't it enough I come to visit? I will. I just gotta do this for my grandpa first. I don't know. It's what he wants. I feel bad for him, all right? I think he's miserable. Look, I just gotta make this exchange for him and then we can go. Oh, oh, I think this is her now.  Cool. Do you have the Hummel? 'Kay, fine.  Old people love Hummels, dude. I don't know, all right?! It didn't occur to me as a possibility. I had no idea what was going on! No, we don't have to do that! Let me talk to him. I can put a stop to this.  Grandpa, what the hell have you gotten me into?! There were drugs in the crochet pillow, weren't there?! Do you know people are dying?! Oh, uh, ma'am? My grandpa actually really needs those drugs. He's in a lot of pain. What, what is she talking about? What's the quiet room? Guys, why does Grandpa have to be in a nursing home? Can't he live with us again? Is that really it? Because I, I just feel like we kind of threw Grandpa away and forgot about him. Yeah. I'd probably go crazy and wanna kill myself. Yeah, it's kind of like jail. You should go visit him. I don't have guitar lessons.  Hello?  Dude, I don't have a choice. I have to get the Hummels for my grandpa. All right, all right! I think I know another way. Ah! Uh hey, hey Marcus. Nothing. I-look, I, I just really like Hummels, okay? I'm just, I'm really into Hummels. That, that's uh... That, it's, it's "Whistling In The Rain." No. Marcus, trust me. You don't wanna get involved.  Guys! Guys, I need your help. I just talked to my grandpa. There's more at work here than just old people pushing pills.  The head bitch of the nursing home is gonna take my grandpa down. Maybe my whole family. But I know what to do! Whoever has the best Hummels controls the nursing home. We've gotta steal this lady's Hummel collection and give it to my grandpa!  Yeah? What ih, what is it, Cartman. Cartman, if you have an idea, please tell me. I need you. Marcus. Marcus, it's not what you think. I'm trying to make things better here.  You can put an end to this place, but you won't be stopping the problem. These people are victims too, Marcus. Victims of a way bigger game being played by way bigger people! It's not for me, Marcus. Look, I know you loved Chuck E. Cheese.  That's why you have to go further, Marcus. Take it to the people who profited from Chuck E.'s addiction. I know. I know.  I got what you needed. Yeah, Grandpa. Now you can put a stop to all this, right? What are you doing, Grandpa? Congratulations on becoming head bitch, Grandpa. Ahhh, don't worry. I have a feeling that's about to happen.
