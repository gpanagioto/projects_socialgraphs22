Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you.  An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials. You can count on Postman Butters!  Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you. It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town. Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers. Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there. But, sir, i was just handing out coupons for- It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom.  Oh hey Dad. I love you too, Dad. Sure. Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver. Sure. Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun. Uh, well, to solve mysteries. Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil! What? Why would I do that? Me, Butters. Sir, I'm confused. Really? Pardon me? Yes!  This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping. Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie ''Paranormal''.  Goodnight, Butters. Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.   Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again! Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!  Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem? Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face. Huh? Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a- This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus! I'm trying, sir!  What? But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh... That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-   Um, excuse me? Wahh! Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you. What?? No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters! It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this. Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here! Hah? Aw man. Oh, come on! AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA! Waaaa!  Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
