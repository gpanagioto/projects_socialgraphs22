 But I'm the fat one. Every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me. Shut up! No way. I, I'd just get made fun of. Uh, excuse me. Butters? Um, well, I was just wondering if...  you would like to go to a movie this weekend.  Okay, thanks. What's your problem, Wendy? You're just a hater. Why don't you mind your own business instead of being jelly? Thanks, babe. Lisa Berger!   Don't be sad. If you wanna look really hot, like me, you just gotta be willing to sweat. Get down to the gym and work! Lisa Berger!  It's okay, Wendy. Who care if no one likes you? Maybe you should go out with Butters.
