==Fictional character biography==
Rusty Collins was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Raised by his uncle, Rusty joins the [[US Navy]] at sixteen years of age. His [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power, generation of fire, manifests itself violently, burning a woman. Rusty is arrested, but when a prison guard playfully threatens him with deadly harm, he bursts into flames again and escapes.<ref name="X-Factor #1 February 1986">''X-Factor'' #1 (Feb. 1986)</ref>

X-Factor is alerted and comes to Rusty's aid, helping him to control his powers. He comes to live with X-Factor,<ref name="X-Factor #1 February 1986"/> who are slowly gathering a small team of mutant wards. Rusty forms a relationship with [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], a former [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #16 (May 1987)</ref>

For a time, they all live upon [[Ship (comics)|Ship]], a sentient being in the form of a long, rectangular spacecraft that towered over all other Manhattan skyscrapers. Rusty and the X-Terminators help X-Factor when an old booby-trap activates, threatening Ship's brain with a gigantic bomb. Ultimately, the bomb explodes harmlessly far above Manhattan.<ref>''X-Factor'' #28 (May 1988)</ref>

==="Inferno"===
During the 1989 "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" storyline, Skids and the other wards, taking the name [[X-Terminators]], the name their mentors used when traveling in their mutant guises, teamed up with the [[New Mutants]] to help rescue mutant babies from [[N'astirh]], who was using them to help keep open a portal to [[Otherplace|Limbo]].<ref>''X-Terminators'' #1-4 (Oct. 1988-Jan. 1989), ''The New Mutants'' #72-73 (Feb.â€“March 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> Rusty himself had gone back into custody at the Navy but willingly goes with the group when he realizes his younger friends, [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] and [[Artie Maddicks]] have been captured by demonic forces.<ref>''X-Terminators'' #1 (Oct. 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> At the conclusion of Inferno, with Artie, Leech and the even younger kidnapped children involved rescued from the demons, Rusty joins the New Mutants, along with Skids, [[Rictor]] and [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]].<ref>''The New Mutants'' #76 (June 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Rusty and Skids help out when long time New Mutants member [[Danielle Moonstar]] loses control of her mystical powers. During the incident they are separated from the rest of the group. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s [[Freedom Force (comics)#Mystique's Freedom Force|Freedom Force]] attacks them at Liberty Island. Part of this conflict involves the ultimate fate of the children Rusty helped rescue; he believes that Freedom Force had wrongfully taken them into custody.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #80. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Due to a fight with [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Rusty is brought back into the sights of Freedom Force. While attempting to escape, he was severely injured by the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]].<ref>''The New Mutants'' #86 (Feb. 1990)</ref> While recovering in the hospital, he and Skids were contacted by members of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]]. With soldiers opening fire on them, they felt there was no other choice than to join them.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #87 (March 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Brainwashed===
Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were brainwashed by [[Stryfe]] into being two of his soldiers. During this, Rusty is part of an MLF strike team sent to a museum to steal an ancient artifact. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], the man who took over the New Mutants soon after Rusty left, is there. Cable slays MLF member [[Sumo (comics)|Sumo]]. He attempts to kill the rest of the group but only gets two of them in the arm, Rusty included.<ref>''Cable: Blood and Metal'' #1 (Oct. 1992)</ref>

Due to the brainwashing, Rusty had no qualms about attacking former teammate [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] during the [[X-Cutioner's Song]] storyline.<ref>''X-Men'' #15 (Dec. 1992)</ref> At the end of this story, the Mutant Liberation Front are turned over to the authorities.

Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were kidnapped by the [[Friends of Humanity]]. While being transported, [[X-Force]] (the team created by the former members of the New Mutants), rescued them.<ref>''X-Force'' #24 (July 1993)</ref> Arriving back to their base, X-Force was soon confronted by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. He was inviting original New Mutants Cannonball and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] to [[Providence (comics)|Avalon]], a "safe haven" for selected mutants. Cannonball refused to go unless all former New Mutants present (Boom Boom, Rictor, Rusty and Skids) were invited also. While Exodus complained that Rusty and Skids were "damaged" due to their brainwashing, he finally acquiesced.<ref name="XF25">''X-Force'' #25 (Aug. 1993)</ref>

Upon arriving at Avalon, the mutants were taken to "the Savior" (in reality [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]), who used his powers to undo the brainwashing done to Rusty and Skids. When X-Force arrived to save their friends, Rusty and Skids decided they would stay with Magneto, feeling that they owed him. With this being done, they joined the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]].<ref name="XF25"/>

When a mutant body belonging to [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], a "survivor" from the [[Age of Apocalypse]], was discovered floating in space near Avalon, it was brought on board. While on guard duty watching over the thought-to-be frozen body, Rusty's life force was drained by Holocaust, killing him.<ref>''[[X-Men]]'' #42 (July 1995)</ref>

===Return===
Rusty is resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XFv3i21">''X-Force'' vol. 3 #21 (Jan. 2010)</ref>
