Created by writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #134 in December 1970, before being officially introduced in the debut issue of ''[[The Forever People]]'' in February 1971. Darkseid is depicted as the tyrannical Lord of [[Apokolips]] whose ultimate goal is to enslave the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] by eliminating all hope and free will in sentient beings. A [[New Gods|New God]] and one of the most powerful beings in the [[DC Universe]], Darkseid was initially conceived as the chief [[antagonist]] of Kirby's [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] saga, before becoming one of [[Superman]]'s greatest [[List of Superman enemies|adversaries]] and the [[archenemy]] of the [[Justice League]].

The character was ranked as the sixth Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time by [[IGN]] and the 23rd Greatest Villain of All Time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/6.html|title=Darkseid is number 6|publisher=[[IGN]]|access-date=April 5, 2016}}</ref> Darkseid has been adapted from the comics into numerous forms of media, having most notably been voiced by [[Michael Ironside]] in the [[DC animated universe]], [[Andre Braugher]] in ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]'', and [[Tony Todd]] in the [[DC Animated Movie Universe]]. The character made his feature film debut in the 2021 [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Zack Snyder's Justice League]]'', portrayed by [[Ray Porter]].

==Publication history==
When [[Jack Kirby]] returned to [[DC Comics]] in 1970, he produced a series of interlinked titles under the blanket [[sobriquet]] "[[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]", which included a trilogy of new titles&nbsp;— ''[[New Gods]],'' ''[[Mister Miracle]],'' and ''[[The Forever People]]''&nbsp;— as well as the extant ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]].''<ref name=gcdjack>[https://www.comics.org/credit/name/Jack%20Kirby/sort/chrono/ Jack Kirby] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>{{sfn|Van Lente|Dunlavey|2012|page=115}}<ref>McAvennie, Michael "1970s" in Dolan, p. 145 "As the writer, artist, and editor of the Fourth World family of interlocking titles, each of which possessed its own distinct tone and theme, Jack Kirby cemented his legacy as a pioneer of grand-scale storytelling."</ref> The omnipotent dictator Darkseid was created to serve as the chief antagonist of this new series. According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby modeled the character's face on actor [[Jack Palance]], while the villain's personality was inspired by [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2006/11/10/the-palance-darkseid-connection/ | title=The Palance-Darkseid Connection | last=Evanier | first= Mark | work=News From Me | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-comic-book-villains-real-life-inspiration/|title=Real Life Inspirations Behind Some of the Best Comic Book Villains|date=Mar 30, 2014|website=ScreenRant|access-date=Oct 12, 2020}}</ref> Darkseid made a cameo in ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #134 (November 1970) before making a full first appearance in ''The Forever People'' #1 (February 1971).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |pages=39–40}}</ref> The character has continued to appear as a main villain in DC Comics, having faced renowned superheroes such as [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], and is now widely considered the greatest enemy of the [[Justice League]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=71–was 73}}</ref>

'''Prince Uxas''', the son of King Yuga Khan and Queen [[Heggra]] and the second in line to the throne of [[Apokolips]], plotted to seize control over the planet from his older brother, [[Infinity-Man|Drax]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=76}}</ref> When Drax attempted to claim the fabled Omega Force, Uxas murdered him and claimed its power for himself.

However, Heggra ordered [[Desaad]] to poison Suli out of the belief that she was corrupting her son.

Following Suli's death, Darkseid's heart grew even colder and his disdain for his mother intensified when she forced him to marry a woman named Tigra, with whom he had another son, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. Seeking vengeance against Heggra for killing the one he loved, Darkseid ordered Desaad to poison her so he could finally become the supreme [[monarch]] of Apokolips. Darkseid then tried to force Tigra to eliminate Orion, but the latter was ultimately traded with [[Highfather]]'s son, [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]], as part of a peace treaty between the warring planets of Apokolips and [[New Genesis]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|penciller=Kirby, Jack|inker=[[Mike Royer|Royer, Mike]]|story=The Pact|title=[[New Gods]]|volume=|issue=#7|date=February 1972|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> This trade eventually became a setback for Darkseid, with Orion growing up to value and defend the ideals of New Genesis as a powerful champion in opposition to his father. The prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of Orion in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of Apokolips. Likewise, Darkseid and his training minion, [[Granny Goodness]], were unable to break Scott Free's spirit after a long, torturous upbringing and Free ultimately managed to escape Apokolips, taking with him the mightiest of the [[Female Furies]], [[Big Barda]], as his wife. Free, now known as the superhero Mister Miracle, and Barda began living on Earth, and Darkseid used this "betrayal" as a pretext to declare the treaty with New Genesis abrogated so the planets could resume their conflict.

Seeing other deities as a threat, Darkseid invaded the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] in order to discover the secret location of the Olympian deities, planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power. Refusing to aid Darkseid in his mad quest, the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] battled his [[Parademon]] troops, causing half of the Amazon population's death.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Second Genesis: Part Two |title=Wonder Woman|volume=2|issue=#102|date=October 1995|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Second Genesis: Part Three |title=Wonder Woman|volume=2|issue=#103|date=November 1995|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Second Genesis: Part Four |title=Wonder Woman|volume=2|issue=#104|date=December 1995|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> [[Wonder Woman]] was able to gain her revenge against Darkseid for killing so many of her sisters by placing a portion of her own soul into Darkseid.

Darkseid's goal was to eliminate all [[free will]] from the universe and reshape it into his own image. To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious [[Anti-Life Equation]], which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion [[Glorious Godfrey]], who could control people's minds with his voice. He had a special interest in [[Earth]], as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation.

Darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many [[superhero]]es of the DC Universe, most notably the Kryptonian [[Superman]]. Darkseid worked behind the scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through [[Intergang]], a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the god of evil.

===The Great Darkness Saga===
{{Main|The Great Darkness Saga}}
One thousand years in the future, Darkseid has been absent for centuries and is almost completely forgotten. He returns and comes into conflict with that era's champions, the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. After using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power, Darkseid transposes the planets Apokolips and [[Daxam]]—which places Daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants Kryptonian-like superpowers equal to those of Superman. Placing the Daxamites under his mental thrall, he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe. However, he is eventually defeated by the Legion and many of its allies.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Paul Levitz|Levitz, Paul]]|penciller=[[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|inker=Mahlstedt, Larry|story=Great Darkness Saga, Chapter One: And the Servant Shall be a Sign...|title=Legion of Super-Heroes|volume=2|issue=#290|date=August 1982|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Paul Levitz|Levitz, Paul]]|penciller=[[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|inker=Mahlstedt, Larry|story=Great Darkness Saga, Chapter Two: ...

However, the tale has been restored to continuity in recent years. In ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 6 #4 (October 2010), explicit reference is made to the events of "The Great Darkness Saga", mentioning (among other things) Darkseid's victory over [[Mordru]] on the planet Avalon. Similarly in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 7 #3 (January 2012), a Daxamite official remarked that the people of his world "still mourn how Darkseid used us for violence".</ref>

===The Seven Soldiers and "Boss Dark Side"===
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s 2005 ''Mister Miracle'' limited series, it was revealed that Darkseid had finally discovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], which he then used to destroy the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] altogether. The [[New Gods]] fled to Earth, where they hid. Highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people. [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] used a wheelchair, the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] was an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad|DeSaad]] was an evil [[psychiatrist]], [[Granny Goodness]] was a pimp (or "madam") for the [[Female Furies]] and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as "Boss Dark Side". It is revealed that Darkseid actually gave the [[Sheeda]] North America in return for [[Aurakles]], Earth's first superhero.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|penciller=[[J. H. Williams III|Williams III, J. H.]]|inker=Williams III, J. H.|story=The Miser's Coat|title=[[Seven Soldiers]]|volume=1|issue=1|date=December 2006|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> This was, in turn, purely in order for Darkseid to get [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], whom he considers the "Avatar of Freedom", in his clutches so that he could eventually destroy the New Gods.

===Final Crisis===
{{Main|Final Crisis}}
As prophesied, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] returns to Earth via [[boom tube]] for his final battle with Darkseid. During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, which created a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid's chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having "won" the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid's life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as "Boss Dark Side", aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]].

Once again bound to the form of a human, "Boss Dark Side" began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to ''[[Final Crisis]]''. In ''[[Flash (DC Comics character)|The Flash]]'' vol. 2 #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the "spoken form" of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], to kidnap the Tornado Twins. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by [[Bernadeth]]. In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #59, it was revealed that he had employed the [[Terror Titans]] to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights.

In ''Final Crisis'', Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and [[antichrist]]-like figure who soon converts much of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to his cause with the aid of the [[Crime Bible]] and the [[Holy Lance]]. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as [[Mary Marvel]].

Darkseid also arranges for detective [[Dan Turpin]] to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's "final host", as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest "rebirth", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], the "Embodiment of Freedom" is shot by [[S.H.A.D.E.]] operatives, thus signalling the "Victory of Evil". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his "fall" having the effect of compressing and crumpling spacetime around Earth.

After escaping from captivity, [[Batman]] shoots Darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Beam, sending back in time and then "infecting" Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into [[prehistoric]] times. Remains believed to be Batman's (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid's fall through the multiverse, he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence. When Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the Anti-Life Equation and that killing Darkseid will kill humanity. Darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him, to kill Orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time (a move Superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions: the bullet used to kill Orion is ultimately fired at him by Batman and is now poisoning him to death).

Before Darkseid can use the Omega Effect to kill Superman, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]] lead the Black Racer to Darkseid and making contact with him frees Turpin from Darkseid's control. Wonder Woman (having been freed from possession by one of Darkseid's minions) then uses her lasso of truth to bind Darkseid's spirit form, effectively freeing humanity from the Anti-Life Equation and being controlled by Darkseid. In his final effort, Darkseid's disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the [[Miracle Machine]] Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid's plan fails when Batman, thanks to the actions of the new Batman ([[Dick Grayson]]), Red Robin ([[Tim Drake]]), Robin ([[Damian Wayne]]), and the Justice League, is able to return safely to the present, consuming the Omega Energy in his body without damaging the time-stream further, thus becoming the second individual, along with [[Mister Miracle]], to escape the Omega Sanction.

[[Doctor Impossible]] later manipulates the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] into helping him resurrect Darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] itself. The resurrection backfires, and instead creates a new being known as the Omega Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Mark Bagley|Begley, Mark]]|inker=Hunter, Rob|coinkers=[[Norm Rapmund|Rapmund, Norm]]|story=Omega, Part 1: Worlds Collide|title=[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]|volume=2|issue=#50|date=December 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

===The New 52===
[[File:Justice League New 52 23.1 Darkseid.jpg|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Justice League'' vol 2 #23.1 (November 2013). Art by [[Ivan Reis]], and Joe Prado.]]
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity.

In the New 52 continuity, there is only one set of New Gods across the 52 Multiverse. So as Darkseid invades Prime Earth in ''Justice League'', he sends his lieutenant [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] to do the same, with greater success, on [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]], resulting in the deaths of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, and stranding Helena Wayne and Kara Zor-L on Prime Earth. Five years later, Darkseid once again invades Earth 2, which never fully recovered from his armies' earlier assault, and it is revealed that he and [[Highfather (comics)|Highfather]] of New Genesis struck a deal allowing him the unchallenged right to invade Earth 2.

In ''Darkseid'' #1, his background story was revealed. Formerly a farmer named Uxas, he hated the deities of his world. So he traveled up to their mountain while they slept and tricked them all into fighting each other. As they were all weakened from the war, he killed them one by one with his scythe (similar to [[Cronus|Kronos]] of [[Greek mythology]]) and stole their power, before destroying his world and creating Apokolips.

In ''Justice League: The Darkseid War'' (after the retirement of the "New 52" imprint), Darkseid comes into conflict with the Anti-Monitor. Darkseid's daughter Grail leads the [[Anti-Monitor]], who is revealed to be a scientist named Mobius, to Darkseid for the former to kill the latter. Mobius believes that with the death of Darkseid, he will be free from being the Anti-Monitor. After an intense battle, the Anti-Monitor fuses the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] with Flash and sends it after Darkseid. Using the fused Flash and his own powers, he kills Darkseid. With Darkseid dead, the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its God of Evil. Later, Lex Luthor would be merged with the Omega Sanction, becoming the new ruler of Apokolips.

After killing the Anti-Monitor using an Anti-Life Equation-powered [[Steve Trevor]], Grail would later resurrect Darkseid through the [[Alexander Luthor Jr.|newborn child]] of [[Superwoman]]. The child has the same powers as his father Mazahs, with the ability to steal the powers of others. Stealing the new "God" abilities of the Justice League, Grail fuses them with the child and brings Darkseid back to life. However, he is under her complete control. Grail later attempts to redeem herself by seemingly killing Darkseid with the Anti-Life Equation. However, it is later revealed that she reincarnated him back as a baby with the intention of teaching him differently.

===DC Rebirth===
Darkseid (as a baby) appears in ''DC Universe: Rebirth'' #1 where Grail tells him of Wonder Woman's long lost brother, Jason.

Baby Darkseid reappears in ''Dark Nights: Metal'' where it is shown that Batman stole him from Grail and intends to use the Omega Beams to send himself back in time. This never comes to fruition and Darkseid is either returned to or retrieved by Grail.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Greg Capullo|Capullo, Greg]]|inker=Glapion, Jonathan|story=Metal|title=[[Dark Nights: Metal]]|volume=|issue=#2|date=November 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

Sometime afterwards, Darkseid matured into a toddler, and using telepathy, demanded that he needed to feast on Old Gods to return to his former self. After killing A.R.G.U.S. agents that were hunting them down, Darkseid and Grail began hunting down and taking the life force of Zeus' demi-god children, killing several including Perseus and Hercules, and growing into the size of a child. After recruiting Jason and luring Wonder Woman to him, Darkseid ages once again into a young man. He fights Wonder Woman himself and as he starts to drain her life force, he is betrayed by Jason. When Zeus appears and transforms into his true form, Darkseid fights the Olympian God, destroying their surroundings in their brawl. When they take a Boom Tube to [[Manila]], Philippines, Zeus grabs onto Darkseid and unleashes bolts of lightning on him. However, Darkseid reveals that he planned for this and that his true target was Zeus himself, and he begins to drain and kill him, restoring Darkseid back to his original self. When the rest of the Justice League arrive, Darkseid decides it is best not to fight them as he does not want to risk revealing his greater plans, and promptly leaves through a Boom Tube with Grail.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|inker=Parsons, Sean|coinkers=Paz, Jason, Hanna, Scott|story=Children of the Gods, Part 1|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=#31|date=November 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Davila, Sergio|inker=Hanna, Scott|coinkers=Morales, Mark|story=Children of the Gods, Part 2|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=#32|date=December 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Lupacchino, Emanuela|inker=McCarthy, Ray|story=Times Past: Grail|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=#33|date=December 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Davila, Sergio|inker=Hanna, Scott|coinkers=Gray, Mick, Ferreira, Eber|story=Children of the Gods, Part 3|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=#34|date=January 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Luppacchino, Emanuela|inker=McCarthy, Ray|story=Times Past: Jason|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=#35|date=January 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|inker=Paz, Jason|coinkers=Parsons, Sean|story=Children of the Gods, Part 4|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=#36|date=February 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref name="Wonder Woman Vol 5 37">{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|copencillers=Segovia, Stephen|inker=Paz, Jason|coinkers=[[Art Thibert|Thibert, Art]], Fernández, Raúl|story=Children of the Gods, Conclusion|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=#37|date=February 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

=== Prime Darkseid ===
During the "[[Infinite Frontier]]" era as a result of the Multiverse being expanded into an Omniverse, Darkseid is trapped in Earth-Omega. He regained his original form by fusing with all his various selves across the multiverse which he declares are all lesser Darkseid. Without an alternate in any other universe he becomes Prime Darkseid. Darkseid's former henchmen eventually reunite with him on Earth-Omega and remain by his side as he gains a new follower named X-Tract (a version of [[Chase (comics)|Cameron Chase]] from the original [[Earth-Two]]).<ref>''Infinite Frontier'' #1-6. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a [[New Gods|New God]], Darkseid is among the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, with immortality, immense strength, and many abilities.

His best-known and most-used ability is shooting Omega Beams from his eyes. Powered by a cosmic energy source called the "Omega Effect", the beams are an intense form of heated energy that can act as a concussive force, can disintegrate organisms or objects, can cause a target to have never existed, and can resurrect fallen beings killed by them. During the Final Crisis, Darkseid used his Omega Beams to grant power to Mary Marvel, and her powers afterwards were based on Anti-Life rather than magic. Darkseid has pinpoint control of this energy, and can direct the beams to travel in straight lines, curve around corners, and even pass through matter or other forms of energy. Some super-powered beings, such as [[Superman]] and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], can resist the Beams, although in the case of Superman, with a great deal of pain. Orion and [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] were able to deflect them, Firestorm once used his powers to redirect them, and, in a crossover story, [[Galactus]] was unaffected by them. Darkseid sometimes uses the beams to punish those who fail him but are too valuable to kill outright.

Darkseid can teleport himself or others through time and space.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Ostrander|Ostrander, John]]|penciller=[[Eduardo Barreto|Barreto, Eduardo]]|inker=Kryssing, Ray|story=In My Life (Part Two)|title=Martian Manhunter|volume=2|issue=#34|date=September 2001|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

His Omega Sanction traps organisms in a series of alternate realities in which they die. Upon their death, they are resurrected in a new reality, in which they die in a worse and more painful manner than the previous.

Darkseid is depicted as immensely strong. He has effortlessly broken a [[Green Lantern|Green Lantern Ring]] with his bare hands, easily overpowered two Kryptonians at once, and defeated the entire Justice League. He can move with great speed, once catching Superman off guard,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=[[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]]|story=Legends From the Darkside|title=Superman|volume=2|issue=#3|date=March 1987|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> and can react in nanoseconds.<ref name="Genesis #4">{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=[[Ron Wagner|Wagner, Ron]]|inker=[[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Joe]]|story=Last God Standing|title=[[Genesis (DC Comics)|Genesis]]|volume=1|issue=#4|date=October 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> Even without his full power and strength, Darkseid has held his own against an Olympian God such as Zeus. He can increase his physical size, his true form as a New God being almost incomprehensibly massive.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Paul Dini|Dini, Paul]]|cowriters=[[Sean McKeever|McKeever, Sean]], [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|penciller=[[Scott Kolins|Kolins, Scott]]|inker=Kolins, Scott|story=Darkseid Equals Death|title=[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]|volume=|issue=#2|date=April 2008|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

Darkseid has powers of [[telepathy]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], and he can create psionic avatars.<ref name="Jack Kirby's Fourth World">''Jack Kirby's Fourth World''</ref>

In "The Great Darkness Saga", Darkseid displayed a range of deity-like powers, such as transposing the positions of two planets in different solar systems, taking mental control of the entire population of a planet, instantly absorbing all the information from another being's mind, pronouncing a curse, manifesting the worst fears of other beings as realities, and easily defeating incredibly powerful beings such as [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], [[Mordru]], and the [[Time Trapper]]. He has also displayed godly abilities by sensing the death of his son Orion<ref name="The Death of the New Gods">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jim Starlin|Starlin, Jim]]|penciller=Starlin, Jim|inker=[[Art Thibert|Thibert, Art]]|story=Sacrifice|title=[[Death of the New Gods|The Death of the New Gods]]|volume=1|issue=6|date=April 2008|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> and fluctuations of the energy of the "Godwave".<ref name="Genesis #4" />

Darkseid is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant who has been trained in the [[art of war]] on [[Apokolips]]. Combining his superhuman powers with his [[combat]] skills makes him one of the strongest beings in the [[DC Universe]]. He is proficient in the use of various weapons, even though he rarely uses them due to other powers like the Omega Beams.

Despite Darkseid's extraordinary physical powers, he rarely engages himself personally in confrontations, as he prefers to use his superhuman intellect to manipulate or control others to his ends.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual">''Doomsday: Year One'' Annual</ref>

As the ruler of Apokolips, Darkseid has access to all of its military and technological resources.

While Darkseid is a deity and immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years, he is not invincible and has been killed on several occasions.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual" /> Darkseid is able to drain the life force of other godly beings to rejuvenate himself or return to his full power. Demi-gods are capable of slowly rejuvenating Darkseid, but a god (such as Zeus) can return Darkseid back to his original form by draining the demi-gods.<ref name="Wonder Woman Vol 5 37" />{{vague|date=March 2018}}

==Other versions==
Darkseid makes his first official appearance in Chapter 22 of the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic on Apokolips. He is seen overseeing the torture of an unseen figure as his son [[Kalibak]] approaches him. Kalibak informs his father of [[Superman]]'s worldwide ceasefire on Earth. Darkseid muses if Superman has begun to soften before Kalibak asks to take a war party to personally investigate. When Kalibak sees just who it is Darkseid is torturing, the lord of Apokolips confirms the man's identity before saying, "He made a mistake." When Kalibak asks if he can be killed, Darkseid chides his son, "Of course not. Who would come for him?" He then allows Kalibak to go, bidding him to kill the Kryptonian and take the Earth. Darkseid grins to himself as he asks to be left alone with his prisoner: [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]], death himself, as Darkseid resumes his torture. In the Injustice Annual, Darkseid hires the bounty hunter [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] to go to Earth and kill Superman in retaliation for the death of Kalibak at the Man of Steel's hands. However, Lobo returns some time later after a 'therapy' session with [[Harley Quinn]], and brazenly challenges the Dread Lord to a battle. Later, under Darkseid's command, [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] manipulates the Justice League into battle with the Greek Gods. The attempt, while initially successful, is defused by Batman and [[Highfather]]'s intervention. The Greek Gods depart with no further conflict and Superman brings Ares to Darkseid to torture in exchange for Darkseid, Ares and their underlings to "never step foot on Earth."

In a crossover comic ''Injustice vs. Masters of the Universe'' Darkseid and the forces of Apokolips invaded Earth and [[Eternia]] to take the Power of [[Grayskull]] for themselves and reach the Nexus of All Realities. There, with his Soul Siphon (a pseudo-Infinity Gauntlet) and the Anti-Life Equation, Darkseid planned to rewrite and enslave a new reality. It turned out that [[Skeletor]] was working with Darkseid all this time since he also wanted to enter Castle Grayskull. He secretly co-opted the power of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] to make his own power sword, and he did battle with Darkseid to control the Nexus. As Darkseid breaks into Castle Grayskull, and prepares to use the Anti-Life Equation, along with the Sorceress of Eternia's Orb of Power, to poison the multiverse, Skeletor betrays him and attacks. He's now powered up, a la [[Black Adam]], because of the Rock of Eternity, and he wants all of that power for himself. However, Darkseid proves too mighty, and pummels the dark wizard, beating him into submission for his treachery. With the help of [[Supergirl]] and Batman and Superman, [[He-Man]]'s crew and the League defeat Darkseid's forces and the residual legion Skeletor had there occupying the lands. That provides a window of opportunity for Superman to fly in and blindside the ruler of Apokolips. With the villain's focus is on Superman, He-Man ambushes the New God, and stabs him in the chest with his inactive Sword of Power, which penetrates Darkseid's armor. Instead of being a full-blown killing stroke on the physical plane, it actually strips Darkseid's essence from reality and turns him into knowledge, which the elders of Grayskull store within the castle. Superman looks on as Darkseid withers away into the abyss, becoming the very thing he sought. After Darkseid death Superman betrayed everyone and killed Skeletor to seize the ultimate power for himself and takes up the sword/orb, puts on Darkseid's Soul Syphon and prepares to step into the Nexus of All Realities. He-Man returned to face the Man of Steel, and with his Eldritch magic, he disintegrated the Kryptonian and helped save all realms. Eternia was at peace again with [[Sorceress of Castle Grayskull|Sorceress]] and [[Zatanna]] working to ensure no future threats like Skeletor or Darkseid arose.

* Darkseid appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', voiced by Perry Brown. He and [[Shao Kahn]] are the key villains in the crossover though both are playable characters. In the game's plot, Darkseid attempted to conquer Earth with help from Lex Luthor, but was foiled by Superman. Attempting to retreat back to Apokolips via a boom tube, Darkseid was hit by Superman's heat vision so he would be too wounded to return soon. Unfortunately, this happened at the same time that [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Lord Raiden]] was zapping [[Shao Kahn]] with lightning as he was attempting to leave Earthrealm. The resulting energy caused the portals the link and fuse Darkseid with Shao Kahn to create '''Dark Kahn'''. Darkseid and Shao Kahn's consciousness did not seem to have any control over their shared body, only being concerned with senseless violence. When Dark Kahn was destroyed, Darkseid ended up in the Mortal Kombat universe by accident, chained in the Netherrealm. In his ending [[Shang Tsung]] made the mistake of attempting to steal his soul for power; Darkseid reversed the spell and took the wizard's. Restored to full strength, Darkseid gained a minion in the weakened wizard.
