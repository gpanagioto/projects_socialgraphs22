 Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city. They're Hollywood! They can do anything! Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you? Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town. Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off? Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is ''much'' better!
