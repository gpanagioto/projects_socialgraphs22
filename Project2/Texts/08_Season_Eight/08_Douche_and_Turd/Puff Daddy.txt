Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting. Apparently, you haven't heard of my "Vote or Die" campaign.   What you ''think'' it means, bitch! <poem><i>Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye..</i></poem> <poem><i>Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you.Yeah.</i></poem> <poem><i>You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!</i></poem> <poem><i>'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice </i></poem> <poem><i>Vote or die! Vote or die! </i></poem> No, Justacious, let him go. He won't survive a fore-night in the wilderness.  Yo, what did I say was going to happen to you, bitch?  Itius, Rodicus!
