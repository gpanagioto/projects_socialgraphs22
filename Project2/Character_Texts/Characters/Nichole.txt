Oh my gosh, who? Oh jeez, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute. That kid, with the orange coat and the green hat? Yeah. Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush.  Yeah.   Oh no, who told you that? Ohhh. Wow, I-I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.  Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here. Oh, he does?  Okay.  Hello?? OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry! Coach wanted me to...  You think the janitors are still here? Look!  And board games. And massage oil. Well that was sure an interesting night. Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been really scary. Yeah, it kind of was. Maybe... I-I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow. Cool. Well... thanks again.  His name is Tolkien. He's really nice. So? It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence. Oh no...  Hey Tolkien. Can I talk to you for a sec? Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out. I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know? I think you're really great... W-w-we just... ...I'm sorry. Okay.  Where are you going? He did that? Oh no. Tolkien. Hey. Tolkien, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black. Maybe we can give it another try? Let them look. I don't care. I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter. 
Nichole! Ugh. Nichole! Nichole! 
We all have to be on-board Wendy. Every girl in school, or it means nothing. 
Why do you care? Do you like Heidi? 
Nothing. Oh, cool. 
'Bout what? We're trying, just talking a lot and seeing if we can work things out. That's... really none of your business.  I don't know what you're talking about. We've never talked about it.  I gotta get to class. 
Oh, give me a break!  It's not just girls who wanna change the menu, it's boys too! Doesn't it matter we're being silenced?! Yeah, but eating this kind of food makes us all just as guilty. It is up to us, as students, to protest for change. 
Hey guys.  Okay, I cast Vampiric Touch on the druid.  Hey guys. Hope it's cool we brought Kelly. She wants to be in the club too. Yeah, we saw it on the schedule. We watch YouTube tutorials. You can find a much on BGG. Oh cool. We just watched the tutorial for that on Dice Tower.   that area. Yeah, we get advanced copies of games because our club reviews them for our gaming channel.  Yeah, but I bet you can't beat Tammy at War of the Ring. Okay, so then let's do it, bitch!
