 All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, "Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!  Did I say something to you, sugartits?!  You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, "The Old Man and the Sea"! Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done! If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?! They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are!  I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how ''hot'' you look! Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage. Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.   Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so. Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking.   scissored all night long. But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.  Teeheeheehee.
