Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check. Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt. Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad. Right now South Park is here. Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea. Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely. Uh - pretty sure. And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon. Uhh... 
Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing? Huh? Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions. 
How's it feel to be 102, paps? Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa. Me. Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh. Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison. Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh. Did you turn the heat down? Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won. 
Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son? 
Uhh, yes, Officer? Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?  Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house. Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy. Ow! Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow! Ooww! 
Dammit, stop. Oh! Dammit! 
How do we get our runaway children back? Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa. Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early. Yeah, it's-it's true, he is. We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes. See ya, son.  Doctor? Wh-where's Stan? Stan, our son? Will he be okay out of the hospital? Okay, well well, let's go look-- I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far. Stan? Stan? Stanley, where the hell have you been?  Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. What? Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley? I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals! 
Uh oh! No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. Okay. Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something? How do you think I met your mother? Oh, brother. Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.  Okay, okay. Give me a second, would you? I didn't snap at you. Whatever. I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry. Uh I think I found it. Hey, back off, bitch! Did I? Stanley, I... Skylarkings? Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school. You need to shape up, mister.  I don't interrupt you. Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation! When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap! Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say. Oh, please! No, she is. Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in. Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up. Well, hello, ladies.  I'm already there. What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more. Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what. Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it. Well, anyway, have a nice day. Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out. You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan? Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party. I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse. Oh, maybe it was. I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse. Sharon? Truth or Dare? No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare? Do you still love me? Well, you never know. Maybe--  --thing will work out.  Dare. 
Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning. Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity. Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. .  Sharon? There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off? What is it? Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick? I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore. Uuuh, do you want your pants back? 
 Eh, it's fine with me. Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something. Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays. 
...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist. Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth. Wow. Or else what?  Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no. Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else. Exactly. Right. It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing? New girlfriend? Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.  What?! All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Do you feel hot? Damn it! How come you're not combusting?  No! Has she been doing anything odd? Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend. No! I think I might have it.  Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust. Wow.   The methane gathers here in the bowel area  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long. Exactly.  I am? I ''am'', huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!  You wanted to see me, Mayor? I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave. Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems. Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent. Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly.  Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up? Stan? Awww crap. Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.  Hey! Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.  Mr. Garrison, help me! I-I don't know what to say. Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me. Hm. Really? Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me. What? You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book. All right. Now, let's get to work. Wow!  ...Right, right right. Uh. Please, everyone-   Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer. It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny. I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow. 
No problem, Jakov. Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels? Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov. 
Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time. Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it. Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him. Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time. We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan. One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little. Yeah, experiment. Hell, we should get in. I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo! Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh? I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things. Good idea. Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me. Huh? Oh, you mean, this? Yeah. That, that was me. Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot. O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.  With two girls or two guys? You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have. ''No'', I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they? Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it? ...Well it is a night for experimenting. Okay, I'll start.   ...Yeah. No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right? Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing.  Um... Yeah yeah sure sure.  Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay? Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself. Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.  Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.  I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub. I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody ''could'' know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.  Well, of course we wouldn't.  Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?  What?! Why the hell would you do that?!  AAAW!!   Who?! Who who did you hear is, is gay?! Oh.   What the hell is that supposed to mean?! Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now? There's nothing to talk about. No, I-... I don't know. No! Will you stop it?! I don't... I just... Aaww!  Sharon, cuh can we go?  Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now. Ogh, I already did. Not now, Stanley.  Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?   God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows. What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-! It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is! You mean it? I'm not gay? Oh, I feel so much better! Wow! Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay! 
Lynch mob!   Here's their van! Here's their van! KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us! 
 What are you doing? Why? ...Are those good moral values? I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all. Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.  My God, you're right.  Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys. Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is! Well, I guess that settles that. Chinpoko ga dai-suki yo!  Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1! Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool? Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves. Well, I'm sure glad this is all over. 
Uh, look, Mr.... Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own. Well, ''some''thing. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once. Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?  
 Alright men, fire!  Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down. Yeh-hah!  He took the bell!  Ow! That hurt!  Oh? Jimbo, have you lost your mind?! Alright, alright. We surrender.  Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.  All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka! Huh? Well, the Union be damned!  Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?! WHERE?!  Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!  We're out of s'more schnapps?  Oh, my head. Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us. Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here. Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff. Ey, that sounds fun.  What was that??  A whole year? 
Yeah, with our own eyes. We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?! That's God? 
Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it. Wasn't that great, son? 
Okay, is everyone ready to go? You didn't know ''that'' was gonna happen, did you, Stanley?  You're from Cirque du Cheville.  Well… Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley! Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping. Huh? Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.   No, Dad. No, Dad, she's dead! It looks like she had a heart attack.  Ew! Uh, girls, we… have some bad news. Um...  Well, Stan, it's not really our-  Uh-oh. I don't know.  That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.  I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls.  Oh, shi-  
Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag. 
 Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.  would you do that too? '''''You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL!'''''  Where is Stan? '''''What?! I specifically told him not to do that!''''' And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they ''do'' make it? Are ''you'' gonna be the one to tell 'im?!   Stanley, what the hell are you doing? You get in the truck right now!   Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed. Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana? Well, maybe it's time. Because I said so! Let 'em be pissed off, then! '''''No!!'''''   ...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school... ...I said good-bye to my girlfriend... ...And I left my family. And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know.  The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world.   And then one day, just as quick as it started... They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car... ...the women all left... ...and they took back my house. The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.  And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about. I didn't ''want'' you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished ''every single day'' that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  Huh? Yeah?  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes. You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid? Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall. Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this. Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.  
Well, ''that'' was quite an uplifting sermon. Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death. Oh, what the hell are they doing now?! 
Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both. 
Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child. 
''That'' is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work! 
Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news? Yeah. Oh, sure, I mean, you know, ''Cop Drama'' is a very artsy, dramatic show.  Shipped. He said "shipped". Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore. Really? So we can't say  fag? ...Hey, you didn't get beeped. I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all. That makes sense. 
Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts. Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years. Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine. You're the new scout leader? He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone. So he's a homosexual. So what? Aw, that's ridiculous. Come on, Stanley.  Come on, Stan.  What did you say?! You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid! Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant! That's better. Nice to meet you.  Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then. Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape. You bet. See ya, Mr. Grazier.   Oh, no. Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off. Oh my God. Well, we've all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too. 
 WAAAH! Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever! No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual. Well, ''you'' know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... ''stuff'' come out.  Well, ''Jesus'', haven't they taught you these things at school?! Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone!  
What? 
 Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?  Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days? Oh okay.  
I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one. Oh, man, it that the IT? Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works. Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.  Well... so... they don't really... do anything. So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth? 
 Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses? Yeah. You'd become what you hate. 
They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon. 
Here he comes!  Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever!  Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny! 
Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void. They let you stay for free? Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend! Oh, do we have to do it right now? Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal. So then it's not really ours.  Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now? Wait... All right, look, we've been here for over three hours. No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay. Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are. Well, ''this'' certainly is nice. Oh, God-damnit!  Don't listen to 'em, let's just go! Let's just get out of here.  That does it! I'm calling the police!  All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave! Oh, Jesus. Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year! 
Stanley, they belong to him. Stan, you're behaving like a kid! Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house. We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!  What is that? What? Jesus Christ! Vaginitis? 
  ahem. 'Scuse me. Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests. With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests. It couldn't hurt.  You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist! Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists. Yeah!  Stan, you're an atheist now! Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food. Noho, it doesn't work that way, son. No it doesn't. Honey! Honey, come quick! Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say.   And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids. Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!  He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up. Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology. No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. }} 
Why? What's the matter with him? Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts. Hey there, son. Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan. Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life. But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever. I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most. If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no ''real'' power at all. 
Well, what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town! Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in. Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us. Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker. If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters. There, I think that's got it.  You can barely even tell you have one on. There is no other team. Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us.  Yeah, and you kicked ass!  Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years. The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you. We can't tell you because we can't know where you are!  Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you.  What's the matter?    Sweetheart, you saw the news... Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves. What's going on? What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble! Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro. Bi kute.  Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!  No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together. Yes, kids.  
Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor. A ladder to heaven? Why, son? That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard. The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven. ''No'', it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny. Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.  No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough. Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but... When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes.  The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is. What?  Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven. If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons.  Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy?? No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it. 
 Butters' parents want to borrow ''The Lord of the Rings'' video we rented. Could you take it over to them? Yeah, whatever.  Hmmm, that gets rid of them. Yeah, well uh, ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.  You wanna go watch?  You ready for some hot, steamy fun? The guys at the office told me I ''had'' to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt ''the'' hottest porno ever made."  I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that? Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready? Oh, yeah.  Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story. Oh yeah.  Yeah, it almost looks like... ''The Lord of the-- [jumps up and sits on the bed, aghast]'' '''''Oh, my God!'''''  This is ''Lord of the Rings''! The boys have the hottest porno ever made. Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet. Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape? Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast?  Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.  Okay, problem solved. Uh... Chris, are the boys over here? We...  The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.  And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape. I'm a...fraid it was... ''Backdoor Sluts 9''.  It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it? We think our boys might be showing other children a, uh... pornographic tape.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.  Where did the boys go with the porno tape? The video sandwich? What's a video stockyard, Jimmy? I know where it is!  Boys! Boys! There you are! A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal. That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting. Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it. Well, let's all get going. 
Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage.   Aw I'm surprised at ''you'', Stanley. I really thought ''you'' knew how to accept people for who they were. No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!    Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture. That's our Cartman.  Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys? Well I really thought you boys learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers! Oh my God. He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way ''this'' asshole was acting. We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top? 
 Who is it, Sharon? Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!  Okay, we've had enough!  I don't know. How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.  Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you. I think he's pretty scared alright. Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us. Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself. Oh. You. You don't? Well, you know what I think, Stan? I think he IS from the future. Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get rid of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol. Oh, Stan!  Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself? Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?  Stan... Uh... nothing. Go ahead. Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand ''did'' disappear! He ''is'' you from the future! Uh..  Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too. Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are. Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorists, but... Well son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything. Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.! You really did a nice job, Eric.  
Christmas is ruined again!  Stan! 
Oh, what a fighter. 
The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?! He's right.   Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square. Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music propaganda! Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle! Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song. The boys are going to give a presentation at ''our'' rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!  Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side. Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song! <i>Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!</i> <i>And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.</i> <i>No, but war shouldn't be our goal.</i> <i>If it means war, then we say NO!</i>  He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another. <i>And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!</i> <i>And me, I'll be the caring soul.</i> Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes. 
Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect. All right, time to win some money! Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em.  How's it goin', Gerald? Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks. Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars?? Gerald, twenty-six thousand-! Where did you get that kind of money??  Just six quarters! He... he lost his house to the Native Americans. They don't care.   But how can they do that?! No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves!  How much do we have to raise, Mayor? Ohhh, never mind.   How can you do this to people? There's more to life than profits! Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff.  Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow. Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town. All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here.  It's in God's hand now.  We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  Oh hell yeah! Let it ride! Dammit! Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak. Stan? Okay? All right? Stan? Okay?  I'm sorry, Native Americans. Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes. It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over. We can stand here as long as it takes.   What do they want? You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you. Well, thanks.  How's your... mother? It's cool on my tongue. Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live. Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people. The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellow Creek. Now go. GO!  Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision?? Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone!  We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture. We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives. 
 Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual. It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz? Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll. You're looking ultra-fabulous.  Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that. Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight. Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about? What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about. Oh really?! Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare. Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!  Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you! Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets! Oh my God, it's on fire!  I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants! Put it out! Put it out! Fire! Hey eses. 
 Stan, are you okay? Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths.  Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not ''that'' big a deal. 
Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue. Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away. Yes Dad. Yes I know.  Sharon, have you seen Dad? Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...  Oh My God! Get inside! Get inside!  Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?! The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!    GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF... GET OFF THE STREET! -STREETS!! OFF- GAAAAAH!!  Get over there! Stay low!  Shhhh!  AWWWW!! RUN!  Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!!  In here!  Quiet! Keep quiet!  Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to.  Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go.  Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now! You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?! We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry? Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did! What the hell is going on?! Dad, what are you doing?? This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!  Stan! Boys! You're safe! They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!  Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them! No, son. We... like to sleep in. They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGE ME!! Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over? Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does. Huh? Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a little. Let's just go home.  
Who? Who are the Harrisons? Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?! We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.  All right, that does it! I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Harrison is, is a white guy, right?  God-damned religious kooks! Tell ''my'' son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass!  Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison? Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a- Uh, look, I just want to tell you that Well, thanks. Uh... Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son. You know. About... God, and stuff. Well, I... Well, no, no, I just... Y-you can call me... Randy. Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honest, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't}} even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem? Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night. Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America? Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion. All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon! One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening. We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening! And?  Your turn, Sharon. Yes. Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion. Ooo, what's that? Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion. Yeah!  
I don't have a son! Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!  What? Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies.  Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right. 
Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters! 
What happened to him? 
What's the matter with him? You got served? By who? So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back? What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it? No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage! Now!  All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye and give 'em this. Come on, Stan. ...six, seven, eight.  What? So what happened? Uh, hey, ex- excuse me. Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm Stan Marsh's father. Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on. No, no, no, it's not on. It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off. I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye.  Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.  Ungh! Grrgh. Stan? Stan? Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.  You did it, son! You did it! 
Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon. I heard people saying you all were from Illinois. ....Yeeeah. Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent? Stan, time to get up for school.  Mr. Jefferson?! Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate! Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting.  
We know, Stanley. We've been watching. That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour. Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?! They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do. Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is! All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking. Stan Marsh! Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  Hey, Mr. Nelson. Why? This is my office. What? You can't be serious. Oh my God. They took my jarb!! We're doing the only thing we ''can'' do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there ''are'' no future humans! Present-day America Number One! All we can do is try, Harrison. Well what are we waiting for? We're going back to the pile. 
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?  You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!  You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?! You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean! You don't understand the issues, Sharon! You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein! Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote! Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended! Expulsion?! Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?!  This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse. Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.  So who won, Mr. Mackey? Stan! He's going to vote! Hey! That's not true, Stan.  Your vote still mattered.  Now your vote didn't matter. 
 Look at it, honey. It's so big. It's beautiful! Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters.  It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.   I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick. Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  Staaaan?  Staan... No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night. Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park. Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled. Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy ''six'' steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart. I know, I know! God!  Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart! Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart! STAN! ''One'' family buying ''one'' glass isn't gonna make a difference! Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?! I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here. Oh all right, maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips. And butter.  And some new pliers. Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all! Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.  Can I help you?  You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better. I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend. Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine. Shhhhh! What are you talking about? Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God! Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us! Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains!  The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight! I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me! This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff! Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us. You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand? All right, let's not make that mistake again. 
Oh, no she di'int.  
Believe what? 
 What are you talking about? Sharon, have, have you seen Stan? Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?! Yeah, but when ''we'' did it we actually ''stood'' for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.  S-stan. STAAAN!  My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan! Stan! Sta-ogh. Ugh!  Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now? Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier. We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake.   It's yours.  My God... I'm the... only scientist in town. You got a better idea, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there! Well I... guess this is it, Sharon. Check. Vehicle shell holding!  The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies.  Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters. Which cord is it? I'm a geologist! Nyugh! It's working! It's, it's working! Stan!  
Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it. Good call, ref! Good call! What'd you say?! You want me to kick your ass right here?!   Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do? I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it? This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America!  Heeey! Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place. Wha-what do you mean? I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life. Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!  Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter! Yeah! Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'! Walk to first! Woo! Fort Collins can't play!  Come on, let's go! I'm right here!  Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry! Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks! What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!  This is America! This is an honest America!  Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever. I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life. They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance. Well I think that there's a uh...  Oh my God.  Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go. I just... don't think I can, all right? Because I'm scared, all right?!  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon. Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I ''have'' to fight him because it's who I am. I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone.  It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!   I didn't hear no bell.  
 Boy, that's just awful. Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault. That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is.  Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen.  My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow.  With all due respect, cliché dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow.    Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!  Come onnn, come on! No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.   Go back, go back!!  Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.  Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building! You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero! All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.  Stan?? Stan!!  Stan?? Stan, you're alive! Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age! What is it, son? You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!!  I'm going to Beaverton. My son is counting on me! You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death! All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find. Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia! Yeah, me too.  Don't be a fag!  We have to try!  
 
Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?! Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley. Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know? Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?! Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed? Right now, Stan!  Stan! What the hell did you do?! All right, what the hell is going on here?! Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay? Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this.  What?! Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet. Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.  What did you say to him? Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out. Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet. Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet! Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer? Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology? All right, go ahead and tell him. Aw rats.   Hey, come out of there! 
 Oh hey, sorry boys.  Hey, see you Nelson. Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home.  Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going. I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys? ...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan. Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole! Aww crap!  Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal.  What seems to be the officer, problem? Okay.  Okay, no problem. Easy. Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem! Do what?? Wull come on, that's impossible! Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  What? What did I do?!  What did I do?! Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these. Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.  Hi Bill.  Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.  But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic. Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again. What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing. Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again. Uh... a disease?  Oh my God...  Hello, Stan. No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick. Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease.  I can't! I'm sick!  Stan. Stan I... need your help. Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?  I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness! I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle. Cure... cure disease. STAN!!  I gotta drive to Bailey.  No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass. They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!   This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will! I sure hope this works. No. No, it ''will'' work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan! Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Is this the line?  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured? I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism. Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him. I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'? I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You? We are the same, she and I. This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!  You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place. The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go!  I'm going to die! Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it. Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me. Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power. Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?! 'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.  I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic. But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now!   What? That means... I'm ''not'' cured. I still have the disease!  Come ON! Let's GO! You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!  I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon! But the statue wasn't a miracle! You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I ''can'' force myself to never drink again.  No?? But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing. How did I manage to raise such a smart kid? Thanks son. Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.  Well how about four? How about twenty? Right right. Does vodka count? 
Good-bye, Chef! Have a good time at the Super Adventure Club! Oh, finally!  Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again? Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right? Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in. Yeah. 
What's this?  A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?! You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?! I know it's not a real ticket!! The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts! And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do! There, like that! Stop that! I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl".  At least ''we're'' smart enough to know better! Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all? Yeah. Good going, stupid! Hey, where do you think YOU're going?! Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em! That's it. That's that the last one. I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend. Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars. You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it. I'm...  I'm not ready... Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us. 
STAAAN!! Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Shelly, go get my gun!! JUST GET THE GUN!!  Unh, come on!  A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character!  SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoons in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore. Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! ''Family Guy''! Because ''Family Guy'' doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... ''precious money!'' We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead. We're alive?? We're alive!  Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!! Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the ''Family Guy'' episode airs in six days! I like the sand idea. It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up? All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole. Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  
 Uhh, Stan?  It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home? Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay? ManBearPig? Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention. 
 Stan? Stan!  You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?  Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together. No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  What?? Why?? Why?! Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys?  Yeah, I'm playing from the office. Yes? That's my son's character's name in Warcraft. Who are you?  Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?! Where?! Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him! Give me the sword. I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online. Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Where's your car? Dammit, mine's in the shop!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON! World of Warcraft! I need to play! Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in!  Staaan!  Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana. No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another? Okay.  Augh! Stan...   I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.  Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... 
  Godspeed. 
 What's goin' on? With a student? But... she's a woman. But... she's hot. Yeah, she's a hot victim.  
 What?  Biggie Smalls?  All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror. I'm a geologist!  ...Smalls.  No way! That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon! 
Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV! Oh, well that's good. ...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago. Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it? Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche? Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are! What are we goin' to do, Sharon?? Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to ''prove'' something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish. Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.   NOOOOOOOOOOO! OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again. Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago. Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO!  
Thanks, Pat! Yeah, they're all rooting for me.   Yeah.  Hi, everybody watching in South Park! Okay.  Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.  An O please. Uh... Well, uh... I know it but I don't think I should say it. Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Ohhh...  Right.  Well, gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang? Wha?! Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money. I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson.  Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right? Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans. Y-Yes, absolutely. Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you. Huh? You want me to kiss your- Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh... Ooh! An African-American performer at the comedy club.  Yeah... No problem... I just... need some aspirin. Fine!  Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how I try, people just say "Hey! There's that 'ni**er' guy."  And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you!  Awww! Awwww!  Whoa!  Please I, I don't want any trouble.  What do you want? What's going on here? No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money. You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did! No. Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "ni**er guy". Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate. Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a ni**er guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence. Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "ni**er guys"?  We did it! 
''[inside] ...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.'' Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good.  Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter! Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them. Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins. That's right. Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs! What is wrong with him?!   Hang on, I'm taking a crap. What? We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys. Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son. Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here. I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions! We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men. Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand. I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected! Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world! I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time. I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father. Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning. You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away. Dammit. Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here! Just get out of here!  Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something. Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us? You... You monster! You have no right to wear that hat! It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge. I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore. No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this! Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit! Just hand over the bunny, Stan!  Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit. No! That is not the way we're remembering it! Oh, we should've seen that coming! No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof. Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter. That's my boy. 
Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars. You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA. No, sorry, I don't have any change. No, sorry.  Huh! I don't have any change.  No!  Leave me alone I don't have any change! Oh, now I ''feel'' bad.  Nono, that was really all the change I had. I just gave you change! Wahhh! I don't have any more change!   Stay awayhay! Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange! Help! Help us!  No sign of anybody else.  Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people. You won't make it through, Gerald!   He's become one of them. We don't have any change! Go away! Find another place to hide, Steve! There isn't enough food for more people up here! All right all right, fine!   Harrrh!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts. Face it, we're gonna starve! Those are cherry! Ich! How? Call the fire department. He's homeless now. We aren't safe. Not yet. It's only a matter of time. If we have to! Siddown Glen! SIT... doowwwnnnn! A bus! A bus is coming!   Don't leave us!  Oh Glen! We made it! 
 Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?! P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff. How painful is "painful"? Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon? Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what? Come on! That's pretty impressive!   Look what your old man made. Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first. Well ''he's'' gotta see this.  No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying! Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard.  Hey guys! Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.  Well I don't know about ever...  I guess it was pretty big.  It wasn't bigger than mine was.  Mine... mine was bigger.  You wanna see it? Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.  That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?   Aw crap! The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.  Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning. Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.  Courics... But that means... Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!  You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!  Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.  What? Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.  Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!  I would need a lot of help. I say...  YYEEAAHHHH! Oooooo. Can I, can I see it? Ahhh... In Zurich?  I can't do it! I can't do it! But then, does it still count?  No... Nooo... I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon?  I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono. Oh God, here it comes!  Yeah, I'm...  Feel a lot better. 
 Sharon, what are the boys doing? They can play guitar now? Ohhh. Hey yeah...  So you boys like this music, huh?  I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how? But... But this is real.  No way! Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh... Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.  I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now? NOO! NOOO, I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON! 
This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff. Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! ''This'' is what really matters!  Oh-oh boy, what's she done now? She's such a train wreck!  For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it. We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest. Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone.  An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.  
 Let's hear it for Gerald! And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway.  
Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone. But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-   My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya? What?!   I know that, okay?!   Gerald. Please help us. Our house... It has no Internet.  We've got nothing! It's just gone.   Oh no you're not!  What?!  It's not working, Gerald. Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it! Right, Starbucks! No! Nobody's is! Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now. God, the whole neighborhood's affected.  Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store. How do you know?! Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!  Jesus, it's statewide. Jesus... we're all alone...  I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't.   Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop! You're right. We can't just sit here any longer. We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way. Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up! Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go. How. You won't have Internet.  Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet. Sure will be nice.  That's right. We need to get online. Come on, Stan, let's get some rest.  Everyone, wake up!  Do they have Internet here? Marsh. NetZero. So is there Internet here? Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet. Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia! Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way?  Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.  Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.  I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy! Three minutes would be plenty.  Ohhh. Yeah, how'd you know? I know, right? "Internet Porn Simulator"  Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  It's just not the same.  Well at least that part's like the Internet. Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Oh niice... Whoa...   Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!   It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me! Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost!  And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  
  There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?  Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot.  There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?  Huh?  Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.  Ohhh this is good! Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday. What the hell was that?  Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here!  Get back to your room, Shelly!  What's going on? What are?! What did that?!  Oh my Gohhhd!  Startled. HAAA!  
 ARRRGH! I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Wave to the camera, Shelly. ''I don't know'' what to do. I'm so startled. Jesus, this thing is worldwide?  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd! Gotta get out! Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Ohhh! We've got to get out of town. Go through that way.  Oh Jesus!  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon? Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside.  Here we see a view from outside the bus. I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon.  All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters. That's a that's a, that's a new sound.  Go! Go go go go go!  Oh no! Oho oho.  Oh, my god!!  Whoa, that startled me! That was ''really'' startling! We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.  I'm so startled.  Oh God, what are we gonna dooo? You can't help him! No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid!  It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah!  It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys. I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside!  What is it? Oh no, I'm way too startled! Jesus, they can't kill it!  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly? Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday.   
Yyeeaahh!!!!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it! Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!  He's so perfect and awesome! Yes I can! Yes I can!  Here comes the change everybody! WOOO!  This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can! I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers! WOOOO Obama! O ba ma! O ba ma! Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo! BOOOO!  What are you? A McCain voter? Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car!  O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama!   Wooo, change. Not anymore we don't; everything's different now. We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore. Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss!  Yeah, you know what? Fuck you!  You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole! It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can! Obama's not talkin' about you!  Uhh...  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!  
Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money. Go on, Stanley.  Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money? Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!   Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all! Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea.  We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves! We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan. Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us. What?! Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement? We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy? That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous! What is this? What's going on? What's he doing? But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?  Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here. Wow, the new Margaritaville!  
Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh, okay, well, thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.   Hey, pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it? I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody. Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again. The question is how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again!  What does that have to do with anything?  What was that? Oh my God, did you just...? At the table? Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon? Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny! Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay? Sharon! Marsh! That's it, I'm leaving!  That's completely different!  Heh, yeah?  Yeah? Come on Stanley, let's go.  It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon!   and of course there's the- Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker!  Jesus Christ!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing! Alright son! Yeah!!  HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing! Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...  Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right. ''There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.'' ''You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.'' 
Alright,   We know! Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again! That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  There. It's, uh it's nothing, really. Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells." When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear. Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son.   Yes I do, yes I do.  Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already? One point five? Come on, Stan, you can do this!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!  Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.  Hey, hey Sharon. So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space. Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon? Hullo? Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing.  That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan. He's got a gun! What do you want? Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy. Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son. We're working on it!   Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.  Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?! Hello? Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!  What?!  Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything. Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax. Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly? No, we're sure. That's right, yep, you're the first ones. ...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact! We will give you a call! Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before. Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast! No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien. Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck. Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look. Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!  You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out. But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again. Oh my God. Spaaace caaash.  Right.  Or what if we didn't call the cops? Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it. Will you relax, Stan?  Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Ah hey, space officers. Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.  There wasn't any space cash. Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash? Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.  Probably.  Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything! No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions! Nobody can build anything!! Wha?! Finland?!   Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything. Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment? All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland. Oh dammit! Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?  Whaa-wha-what about it?  Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland. Hey guys, Finland's dead. Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.  No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide. Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'. Stan? Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.  Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?  Yeah, no, we've told you everything, space officers.  Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax! It was... a trick? No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!}} 
Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?  MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese. Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.}} 
Isn't this great food? You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and they- Fags!  Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots!  
I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4:00, you got it? What's going on? Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened? Oh my God. I've gotta help him!  You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee! It's the pee! It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out! Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died. I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants. Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors. I'll do it.  Give me the banana.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah. Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww. No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.   
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?  
Read what? So? Huh? "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross! "He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this-  Noo, noo, that's just WRONG! "Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"  "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man. It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's the best book I've ever read. No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow! NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff. Butters? Is that true? Ohkay boys, you already told the truth. 
 Hey, uh, what's up with the KFC? Alright, boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on.  Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC? Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!  My huh? Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back!   KFC's gone, been replaced. Yeah, well, I gotta get to the doctor.  I gotta get to the doctor!  All right! That's great. So can I get a referral from you? Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed. But you said I'm totally healthy! ...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer? Yeah, but what's the quickest way? Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver? Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay.   Stan? Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon! SCORE!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?! Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival... One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush! Uh that is nice! That is nice! I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh? Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer!    Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing. No, Peter Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer. Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em. Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies.  See? Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed? I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed. Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh? Hey. My eyes are up here. It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe.  Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please? Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over? Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high? What do we want? Where do we want them? What do we want? Where do we want them? Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls.  Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir.  And when it gets cold it shrinks.  
Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now? Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend? ...Oh okay.  So I'm, I'm not your friend then? ...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend? Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr? Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends? Oh cool! Okay.  Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma? Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her! That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it.  Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back. Stan, poke your grandma! Yahtzee! Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore? Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then? 
You just had to push it, didn't you, Stan? You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again! Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks! Mr. Cruise, my son is so, so sorry, and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments. Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box...  We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages... Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer again.  ANYTHING! Anything you want, Mr. Cruise. Sure! Who is it? We can get anybody for you. That's... tricky... Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we- Okay, people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park. Alright, Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I've done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today.  Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad. Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo. Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, not even showing his eyes?   Aw. Aw, it's just a stupid threat! Come on, we don't wanna piss off Tom Cruise again.  What the hell was that?! Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved.  Helllo? Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you. There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they're gonna bomb us. Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise. Well, yeah.  
Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you. Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?  She's destroying everything! We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is. 
I don't really work out. People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands.  More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey. Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own. Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next? Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?! Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography! Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own! There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help. We could ask Al Qaeda. Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them. People from Jersey? What is it? That thing is famous? Why? Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this.  Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?! What does that mean?! Stop playing stupid!  What are you people planning?! Yup. They're from Jersey alright. This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey!   Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey! Then we've got to start falling back to Utah! It's Al Qaeda!  On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden.  On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences.  We got him! 
Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now. What does that mean? What?! Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible? What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?! That does it!  I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too! Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son! I said get me in there! Ahhh. Stan?  Stan! Yes, it's me, Stan. It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly! I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings! I was gonna, but ooh! This is fun! Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.  Aah ahhh aha ahhh. Aw, dammit.  
Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon? It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous! I mean, hello! Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace.  What the hell is that?  Who put that there? I don't know. I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools.  
Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time. Ugh. I'm not staying up to do ''that'' Sharon, jeez! Psseh... huh...  Oh yeah. Fuck. Mmm, God damn. Yeah. Yeah, it's fuckin' money. Aw yeah? Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah.  Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again! Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and heirloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww... No! Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!   Aw yeah, look at that. I worked all day! I can watch what I want!  ...Yeah. Whoa. See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo. Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!  Aww, stupid commercials.  Come on! Bohh-riiing.  Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm. Channel blocked?  Sharon, what are you doing? I wasn't watching food channels! I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw!  Crème fraîche. Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?  Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven? Yeah? You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan? If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan. Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing? Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah. WAH! Sharon! Hello there, children! How's it goin'?  The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great? I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche. Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli. Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah. Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.   Fraîche. Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh... Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah. Quiet on set, please.  Back from where?  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay! Talk to me?! Oh Jesus! Yes chef! No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream! Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay! Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes! Jamie Oliver!  Behind you!  I'll be right back! Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche?? I don't have time! I'm cooking right now! You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!  I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode! Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Ugh, I'm tired. Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything? I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  
Oh dear. Did they measure from the base or from the balls?   I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this. Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you. Good! The man puts his penis  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids. And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud  Four point four inches... Seven centimeters... Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average.  PUTAIN D'MENTEUR!!!   Aw, suck it! All o'ya! You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!  Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!! No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit! Yeeaahh! Yeeaahh!     This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express! We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the- Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing! Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down! And we want- Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um, Yeah, we want our moms to stop trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it? Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt! No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?! Rrrr! 
Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party. Well, do you really think we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to? Tween Wave? Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?  ...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.  "Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber." I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool.  Uh... NO I mean...  I like it. No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon. It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome!   Ugh, that's so unfair! Yeah it's good! Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us. What? Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau! No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon! Anybody could play it. Do you really think so? Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old!  City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much  City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks. Yoyoyo!  You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?! I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon! I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be! Why can't you ever just support me?! Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old! Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time!  I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it. You kind of seem shitty to me too. 
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with ''one'' shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" ''freak''! I mean ''look'' at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!  Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together! We worked it out, pal. Surprise! 
Well, I think it's good.  
I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?  You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing? A musical?  What?  Nuh uh.  Noh uh. Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?  Oh. Wicked. Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon? Okay, I'll be right back.  Can I get a scotch and soda?   Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected. To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening. Subliminal messages?  Whoa, no way! You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time! She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes. Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it. Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something. Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now. Really?? Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?  I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours! Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans! Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be! It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times. Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?  Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town. And hold!  Uhh, this better be important. Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it! Not much, sup with you guys? Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs. My musical has ''lots'' of subtext. And then she does. It's a metaphor.  Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too! Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!   What is it now?   Then what am I supposed to do?! Run? I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Whassup brah?! Sup brah?! Right here, brah!  What makes you the brauthority brah?! What brah?! What brah?! What brah?! I do respect you, bro! I do respect you, bro! I respect you, bro! Okay!  Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do! Hey, really?? Oh, that is beautiful! Bro'dwaaay! Ooof.  Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys. Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it. Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?  Alright babe. Okay. What's Shelly doing?  She's WHAT?! OH!  AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?! She's too young for that stuff! This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter! I can't! Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext. D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"? And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"? Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon. No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry. AAAA! Shelly!   Shelly, come on. We have to go! Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on! Oh you fucking pervert! Shelly!   Sorry! Sorry. Agh!    I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad. Really?  I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier. 
Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer. Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh... Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket! I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick.  Yeah thanks.  Asshole. No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work.   So ridiculous.  Thanks.  Aw, you people have me on camera now? Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights? Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA.  What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet? We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity. Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves. It is time for us all to grow up. It is time for a sue-ance. Well, yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off. Oh, that's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops. 
Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.  Just trying to leave without being rude.  Grandpa, how much did you spend on that? Six thousand?! Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ''our'' money! 
BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM! That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow. All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.  Huh?  Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?! Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?  Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?! Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric!  Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug! Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!  Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team! Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool.  Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it. How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about! Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is! Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!   Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks! Yeah, no, ''you'' nice going!  Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt!  Oh yeah, good one!   Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs! YEAH!  YEAH! WOO! Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared.  Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it! ...Yeah...  All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow. That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better. That's IT!  Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show. Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this. Thanks Jim.  Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal? Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now! Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic! Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.  Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better. So that's it.  No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse. My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety! Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much!  STAN?! Stan!   Get in the car, Stan! We're going home! Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  God damn it! Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do! Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous! I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity. ... Come on, everybody, let's work on that kick off change and get back to some football.  
 Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it? Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives? No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.   Oh, is that so?  Sure um... Chad, is it? Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day? Yeah I'll bet.  Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you. Yeah, w-what are they?  You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what? Yeah, sure, 'cause...  Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Ooohhh shit. How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?  You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?  You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive. Oh no, pull in here. Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun!    Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark. Huh? Nothing. Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean? And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.  We scared him! We thought that'd be enough! This guy doesn't know when to quit!  Hello? Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.  Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is. Yours? What? It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves. 
 It's finally happened, Sharon!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.  And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now. I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video!  Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it? You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition. Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan? Well? There she is.  Shelly come on! Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Well, what do you think? Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it. You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS. How many uh, how many copies of ''Meet The Fockers'' do we have in stock, Shelly? Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly. Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?  People just don't know we're open yet!  Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something? Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong! Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place! I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone! Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!  Hey, whoa, what are you doing? Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night! Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here! . This is the night we turn it all around. Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be ''swamped'' with people trying to rent DVDs! Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!   Sooner or later! They'll have to come!  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie! I'll take a DVD of ''Robocop 2'' and the director's cut of ''Blade Runner''. No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak. He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother. No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!   Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little ''talk'', Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  What are you doing, Shelly? Okay.  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'! Who are you people?! You aren't real! Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  Run! You'd better run! Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr! Haarrrr!  Raaaawr!  Streaming ''Halloween 4''! Hahaha! AAAAA!  Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?! Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!   No... Yeah... Okay... Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange.  
Oh I feel like such an idiot. But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today. All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair! I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now.  
Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  ...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show. Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff. Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?! Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row! Yeah, I got lube right here. Yeah-hah!  What the?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock? Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft? What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?! Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock? What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now! Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!  Oh. Well okay, great. NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November! I can't afford DirecTV. No, just the usual cable-company stuff. I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off. Hi. Corey Lanskin? We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults? Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're ''desperate''! We have a hundred ounces of silver.  Why, why would we punch trees?  Watching informative murder porn? Puh, punching trees? Oh, I see. So when does the game start? ...I don't get it. Yes ah, I'm getting it now. No.  I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one. Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond. No, ''I'' know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube? Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back. Yes? No, what happened? Punched his trees, huh? Huh.  That's weird. I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo. Will do, officer. Will... do...   Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks! Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!  Oh crap. Sharon, I'm I'm sorry.   No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us. Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here? It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you.  Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from. Oh yeah? What's that?  Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull! Felt great? Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill ''you'' now. That felt so good! Okay, hang on. Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now. OH! Ohoho, you bitch!  Ohohunh. I love you too babe.  OH! 
I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.  So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday?  Is it really as bad as they say it is?  Please to put a penny in the old man's-  Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash. I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.  Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want! Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Morning, Joe, Marcus. What is it? Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both. Whoa! Haha.  Yes sir! No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh. You-d, you do?  Yeah... awesome... Alright, listen up.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God! No!  No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you! No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.  
Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner. Everybody stay put! I'll handle this.   If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving. Well, you're about to be. You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while. Smartasses.  My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?! 
Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did ''not'' deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  Stay tough, rookie. We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?! OKAY?! Not one more good person dies on my watch!  Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO! Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?! What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them! Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh? WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I ''REALLY'' CARE ABOUT HIM!   
 Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school? A startup company? A company that does what? Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name. 
 Make your dick fly off? What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars? Hamburger Helper? There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon! Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS! This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan! Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?! Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you! You sure? All r- all right, you got those?! All right, come on!  Son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah!  Yes? Gluten expohn... oh not here! Wuh sure!  Well that's just a beer.  beer is bad for you?! Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick? No! Not Papa John's.  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!! How long do I have to stay here?! What am I supposed to eat? Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.  Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay? I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand? How's your mom? Your, your sister? That's my son, you bastard! Staaan! Staaaaaaan! You can't just keep us in here! They don't care about us. Face it. We're already dead to them.  Are you crazy? Oh my God, you...  But... you're okay. Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who could get the word out. Ng-oh.  <poem><i> Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.</i></poem> <poem><i>We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.</i></poem> 
 Aaah, I don't know. Why? In my jeans?  ...Yeah. I do. Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel. You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?! Every time? Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup.  <poem><i>Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.</i></poem>  <poem><i>Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.</i></poem>  Shelly, that's enough time on your phone. You know we're all cutting down on phone time.  Oh really? A-About... about what? Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde. It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down. Yah, that's my cover. Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs. Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."</i></poem> Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Stan?  You wanted to see me, boss?  Hi Carol. Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined. I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music. With what?   It's okay, it's gluten free. 
 I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde. Wacky Races?! Holy shit! I know! Are we watching at your house?! All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today. Geez! Did you see that?! Oh! Ohh! Ohh! Duuude!  Oooo! Booom! 
 Eeww. It's simple. Oh yeah, this is gonna work great.  Heheh, Gerald is watching ''Housewives of Atlanta.'' I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  No! Noooo! I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere! Okay. No. I didn't.  What might be? ...Drones are spooky? 
You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?!  You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"? Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough! How?! Can you believe him?! He ''knew'' how much he was spending! He ''knew'' he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.  Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan? I ''had'' a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop. Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  Come on Dad, we're going home. Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit! I just don't understand what is ''wrong'' with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?! It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for! I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp* What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough! $26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?! Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?! You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?! I am not chugging beer!  Oh pass interference! Interference!  Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that.   What are you gaywads doin'? Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine.  It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse. You guys wanna put some money on it?  
Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous! It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college. Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely.  Oh? Not impressed? How about this?   Hey! Oh! Oh thank you! Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey! All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback. Oh yehhs yesyesyesyesyesyes, Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college. Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer. People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Hey kids, are we having fun?   Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please! Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!   Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody? Alright, come on up here.  What's your name? All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  
Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert! Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no. What is that supposed to mean? Yes, Freemium gaming. I ''love'' Candy Crush. Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up. And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person? You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow. If she means that much to you. How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little. Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work. No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live. Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that! No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models. Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you. Fuck you!  They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong. Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something. Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!   Sorry folks, just one second here. Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo!  Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about? I was told to! Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him!  Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing? Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be- This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth. Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth.  I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do. Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of. I'll do no such thing! You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content? Sharon? Sharon! They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us! The hologram's in our bedroom? You slept with Tupac?! SHARON! 
Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it. Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde. No! That was a copy of me! Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned! Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde. Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do? A holiday special. Oh my God.  Can you help me stop them?! Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do. We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth! Oh my God... My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world. I guess... one step at a time. Shelly? Um, I'm Lorde. Whew, that was hard.  Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS! THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  
I mean, who the hell does this guy think he is? Some college kid's gonna come in and tell us our ways are old? Yup, that's right. Can I speak with PC Principal please? Hey what?   Yeah!  Wooo-ooo! I've joined a social awareness group. It's a coalition that discourages the use of ... words that have negative or offensive connotations... to grant respect to people who are victims of unfair stereotypes. We've been getting away with horrible things, Sharon. Having- laughs at less privileged people and thinking it was harmless. Our group is... trying to be a civilizing influence... where we discuss and have meetings to better define and reinforce tolerance and acceptance  of all groups of people. Uhhhh... They serve refreshments, yes. I'm sorry, I don't know what that is. You want me to shame Brett Favre?  Did I check his privilege? Yes. I had some refreshments and I checked your friend's privilege. Stan, straight white males in a capitalistic society have little- understanding of victimization compared to injustices against the underprivileged. Dicks on your face is a very first-world problem.  <poem><i>Woowoo!</i></poem> Ow, hot. Hot hot, hothohhht.  Ahhh. So I'm PC now? Oh wow. Oakleys!  
 
  It would instantly validate us as a town that cares about stuff. And why not?! Huh?! We all just don't believe we could get a Whole Foods! Because we don't believe in ourselves! Mayor? Lots of cities are dong this. The area south of Downtown South Park has always been the ugly eyesore of this town. But now, SoDoSoPa... is going to bring in the fresh new vibrancy that Whole Foods can't ignore. Oh, this is really exciting. I thought this area was just gonna stay shitty forever.  We're gentrifying. It's all good. Okay, hold on, everyone listen up! We understand that not everyone is for the town spending money on the SoDoSoPa project. We want everyone to be able to voice their concerns.  Stuart, come on. Your house sucks. My house is nice. It's like a dream come true, Nelson. This area is gonna put our town on the map.  Hi, um, yes, my name is Randy Marsh, and um, we would like to try and get a Whole Foods in our town? ... Yes, that's right. Aaah, yes, it's ah, South Park, Colorado. Nonononono! Nononononono!  Oh, hello again. Stephen and I were just heading to SoDoSoPa to enjoy some specialty foods.  Uh, well, tonight, you're at our Motel 6. But, we'd like to show you the plans for something extremely exciting. Oh Jesus! We forgot all about that guy! God, why do the economically challenged always have to screw up everything?!  Come on, we'll get that asshole! Alright, take these kids and hide them in the- Ow! You little-!  
Mornin' Ger! Just another day in paradise, huh? Hi. Two of us. please? Whoa, what'd you say to him? Who are you? 
 Alright.  Oh, uh, no, that, that's okay.  I'm, I'm good.  Not today, thank you.  Oh, come on. Look, I give money to charity a lot, okay? I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food.  Look, if I give money every time I went grocery-shopping, I would be-!  Dick! Oh no, my, my fault. This is where I come for lunch every day. Gotta eat healthy to stay fit.  Great.  Uh, listen, before you ring me up, I just wanna let you know I'm not gonna be giving extra money to charity, so can we, can we just skip that part? Yeah, thanks.  No. I said no, before. This is not streamlined!  I can't. Dammit! The sandwich isn't coming out. I was having a nice day!  Yes. Yes, I would like to give a dollar. Yes, I will. This is a place where hope is scarce. These people are hungry. Little Jojo here might not eat today. But does that mean it's okay for cashiers to ask us for money while we're in the checkout line? It isn't right, and it isn't fair. Just $2 a day adds up to 62 goddamned dollars a month if you go to Whole Foods as much as I do. Nobody should have to feel the shame, the humiliation, of being asked to add money onto their grocery bill. Help now. Let's make grocery stores a #SAFESPACE for all. Together, we can make a difference. <poem><i>You might call me a pussy, but I won't hear you in my safe spaaaace.</i></poem> <poem><i>My safe spaaaace.</i></poem>  And this is Vin Diesel. It'd be... a really bad idea for you to charity-shame me today. These guys are here to protect my safe space.  But it doesn't stop there. People also can be shamed for other traits viewed as negative. Mike here was shamed for not being a good recycler. Let's work together to create a completely shameless America. Yeah, um, I'm a little tired because I'm actually hosting a huge fundraiser for my charity organization  that I'm sort of the head of. Yeah, we're gonna raise a lot of money. Celebrities are coming. Demi Lovato is givin' a hundred thousand for the event. I just thought, you know, a fundraiser dinner was sort of the appropriate place to ask for donations.  ...What? Did you not hear anything I said? I'm - I'm doin' all this stuff. Actually, my big fundraising gala is helping put hamsters through college too. You're welcome.  Alright everyone, thanks for coming to help raise money to stop shaming, and put hamsters through college. And now, a woman who knows about shaming firsthand, supermodel Gigi Hadid. What? Reality? Who let him in? Shit!  Alright buddy, let's go. Seagal?!  Listen, everybody.  I think there's a way to try and make this right for everyone. To date, Shameless America has raised over $40,000. With that money, we are putting more and more iPads into these people's hands.  We won't rest until America is completely shameless. The world can be brutal, but Shameless America is going to continue to take steps to make sure everyone has a safe space... forever. Uh huh.  
For what? What? Wow. Our town has only had a Whole Foods for three weeks and we already have our first gay kids. So cool.  Hey, bud. How's it hangin'?  Well, guess what? You've got a really progressive PC dad who knows all about this stuff, okay? Go ahead, ask me anything. Ah, well, you see, it's a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.  Uh are y-, yeah, yeah they do. Uh, the Asians just, you know, the Asians pick who they pick, and um, it's al- it's, the way it's always been.  Yeah, of course. Yaoi, anal intercourse, Maui Zaui, I, I know all this stuff, Stan.  Uh, hi, Mr. Jinping. Thanks for taking my call, I was... just wondering if you could shed some light on how your people decide who will be gay and who will be straight.  I'm sorry, I-I don't speak Asian, but... um, oh uh, oh, y-yao, yaoi. Yaoi, yes? Boizu rabu. Huh, how does that work? Oh, it's Japan that decides?  Aaaa-a-ah, Japan. Of course, is who does the yaoi to make people gay. Uh huh, yes, that of course I do already know about homosexuality. Hey, hey, whoa, you didn't do anything. Yeah, let me handle thisk guys, I'm PC. Look, Thomas, you need to understand that being gay isn't a decision. You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide who's gay and who's not. But it isn't all Asians, it's just specifically the Japanese, okay?  Well, it all goes back to World War II, and atrocities that happened in China called the Rape of Don King. Yes I do. 
Really? I'll bet you don't even know what "farm to table" means.   Ew.  No I don't I'm sorry thank you Goddammit ew.  Mayor, I didn't bust my ass to gentrify this part of town to have it overrun with homeless people! What? Okay, we've just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didn't mean it, okay? Alright, look. There's homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district. If you don't stop thewe twisted kids, then-  Officer Barbrady. Hey buddy.  We need you to shoot some kids.  Shh! Shhh! Shhhh! These are really bad kids. Terrorists. This is totally different from before. You're the only cop this town needs, Barbrady. Go shoot those kids. Okay, okay Dad, it's not organic chicken. I'm not comfortable shopping at Whole Foods with all the homeless people there. But don't worry. That's all about to change. Soon we'll all have CtPaTown to enjoy again. Where's Stan? Ninjas? That's gay.  He's playing ninjas at Kenny's house? You mean, SoDoSoPa?  ...scary... gay... Scary. Gay. Scary gay scary gay. Scary gay scary gay scary GAY.   Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now. I said kill some kids, but I said it as a question, remember? I said "Kill some kids?" Thank you, officers. 
Oooo, brutal celebrity mugshots.  O-hoh it got me. Ad got me, Sharon. What? Sh-sharon, most of the guys in my PC club are right out of college, alright? You know how college kids are. Who wrote this?  I don't cheat on you, Sharon! I'm happy. Look at what's happened to our town. We have ShiTpaTown, boutique restaurants and artisan shops. We have a fucking Whole Foods, and that was all me! Diverse people are moving here, and everyone is being aware of how they talk. This is paradise, Sharon! He or she is an agenderphobic microagressions, Sharon. You are a bigot.  
So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now. You guys wanna bail?  It's just, you know, it used to be nice and laid-back here, but now it's all  Uuuuhhh, you know? Like like now everybody's all Uuhh-uuhhh. Let's bail. You wanna bail, Stan? Nothing! I just... You know, we don't have to live here, we can live anywhere.  All these fancy new restaurants and shops and  everyone wants to live here! A bowl of City beef costs ten bucks now, for Christ's sake. And there's nowhere to shop but stupid Whole Foods! I had to take out a second mortgage on the house.  I had to, Sharon! It isn't my fault! It's the Man. Don't you see? The Man... is pricing us out of our own town. Don't you get it? That's just what they want. Nobody cares about the people who lived here before. They want us to move, 'cause they wanna knock our houses down and build more lofts and villas!  Oooff! Hey, it's Caitlyn Jenner!  Principal Victoria?  One of what? Hey, fuck you.  Garrison? The hell is wrong with you?! I don't know what you're talking about.  All right, it was kind of my idea. What? To take one area of town that was rappy and gentrify it for the local people to enjoy? I thought we could keep it contained. Oh my God. What does it mean? Not me. If PC Principal has been using us, I'll take the bastard down myself.  Whoa whoa whoa, guys, whoa! We can't just go walking in there. This is a safe space. We're not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is. Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered. Wow, how did you-?  Whoa. It doesn't make sense. Someone's always here. Click on that. What is that? Whoa, whoawhoawhoa wait wait wait. What, what were we doing again? 
What? Why wouldn't I be able to pass the garlic bread?  What, wait. Where was I what? Out, with friends, doing things.  On stuff to do, things.  Um, oh I'm gonna take some of this with me. I'm still hungry. Jee-sus! What? Am I on trial or something? God-damn!  Alright, we're good. Nobody suspects a thing. '' Not human? Then what? Oh my God. Don't you see what this means? If something not human is gentrifying the entire world, soon no human will be able to afford it. They're trying to price our species out of existence. There has to be something. Some clue as to what we're dealing with. That sounds like vampires to me. Stan, what the hell are you doing in here? Nothing. We're just hanging out, talking about Coldplay, alright? What are you doing with that? Stan, it isn't what you think. Look, I need to show you something, okay? You need to see this, son.  Ohh! Psych! Now put the fucking gun down, bitch! Oh yeah? You go tell her! I'll tell her you had a gun! You'll be in more trouble than me!  Stan! I am your dad. Put the gun down and sit over there. Shit!  I'm warning you: you're on the wrong side of this! We're just trying to get answers! He pulled one on me first, Sharon!  Stanley, let your mother and I deal with this!  Whoa! Whoa, Shelly! Put down the gun, Shelly! Shelly, put it down, now! I want to, Shelly! I just sometimes feel like you hate me!   Alright. I'll tell you everything.  Yes. They wanted to use his PC as a means to start gentrification in our town. When the pussy-crusher story came out in Super School News, it started to make PC Principal question himself. He started digging for answers. They didn't like that, so they tried to distract and mislead him. With this.   Well then, it's time to go ask Kyle why he sold out his own kind. We're going to kill him with kindness. But instead of kindness we're going to use guns. Come on, let's go!  Shelly, you take care of Grandpa! Nonono, don't shoot Grandpa, just literally take care of him.  Nobody move!  Listen to me, everyone! There are beings who are purposely gentrifying the Earth so that humans can no longer afford it! We've been looking for Kyle Broflovski! Somebody's hiding him!  Classi? An ad? Woah, flippin' ads! They're such a pain in the ass! Mackey? We all could be better people! All of us! We all played a part! If only we'd had these before, huh? Well, I guess there's just one last thing to take care of. Why did it have to be like this?! Why couldn't we try to live on this planet together?! Maybe we're not perfect beings, but we built a better town. We didn't need you to do that! And we'll keep on trying to make it better! Go on, get outta here! We know! Others will know!  
Screw that. I've got 100 bucks riding on this. Come on, Nichole. Sit on it! This is it. Wow, Yeah, 100 bucks! Oh great. Everything's getting a reboot now.  Oh. Oh-okay. Well, this is usually a giant douche household but... we're going firmly with the turd sandwich. That's right.  You can put my wife and I both down for turd sandwich.  What? What the hell is wrong with people?! They really think that a giant douche should be President?? It's insane! You can't possibly be thinking about voting for the douche?! What's wrong with you?  Because we're Americans. 'Cause this is America  Cyyynical. Cynical maaan. You just think everything and everyone is dumb, huh? 'Cause you're a kneel-ist. See, you're such a nihilist. What is wrong with people, huh?! How can they vote against a turd sandwich more than a giant douche?! It's senseless!  People actually think a turd is worse than a douche! Member berries? Oh, they're adorable.  Ohh, I 'member. Wai- what?  Wait. What the fuck's going on with these member berries? 
Stan?  You can't just stay in your room all day.  Everyone's divided. Nobody's getting along. And there's people like your MOTHER who are thinking of voting for a DOUCHE because she doesn't have a BRAIN. I don't know what's wrong with people in this town. More and more are agreeing with your mother. I tried getting on community message boards and swaying people's minds but... it always ends up with some asshole talking about vaginas and photoshopping a dick in my mouth. That's where we're at today. Everything sucks. Okay, what?! The fuck?! Is wrong with you people?! I just saw a new poll that says more and more of you are thinking about voting for that douche! 	You're tellin' me that after that debate, you still wanna vote for that guy?! Did you see the same debate I saw?! 	 I agree. 	Shit, I'm startin' to really like this guy. I was wrong, Stephen, I'm votin' for your guy. 	It's just...  I see what you mean. He talks like an ordinary person. And he has a lot of the same emotions I do, you know? He's got my vote. 	 What? You were just voting for him yesterday! What happened?? What the hell is wrong with people?! You just don't flip back and forth like that?!  ...I did. What's going on, Stephen? Why does everything suck this hard? But how did we get here? Completely confused and with shit for choices? It's like... it's like there are other forces at work.   Yeah, I have some questions about uh member berries? Oh my God, there's this many? 
Gerald. Hey come on in. You're not alone, bud. We're all facing the same struggles and trying to do something about it. Anyways please continue, Richard. It's okay, man. You're not alone. And that's how we got here to this very memberberry election. What have been your struggles with memberberries, Gerald?  Michael, are there memberberries in your pocket? Anyway, Gerald, what has your experience been? 
	Hey, Mr. Garrison. Come on in, bud. Have a seat, you're not alone. No lynchings here, little cowboy. Take a seat.  You wanna share with us what you're goin' through? It's not your fault, little guy. 	Not your fault. You've gotta stop blaming yourself. Here, catch.  That... is why millions of Americans want you to be President. But there's more... Every great empire reaches a point where going backward can seem more appealing than forward. When the world is changing so fast it makes us yearn for the old ways, when life seemed simpler. But it doesn't mean those old ideas are good for us now. We have to face one hard reality as a country.  The new Star Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was. It may seem fun to go back and recycle the past we loved, but we end up with no sustenance. Well, that's important too, I guess, but, it's just a symptom of the same thing. See, when a civilization has become so big it starts to get lazy, then that's  Once too many Romans ate the member berries there was no more growth. They rested on their laurels just eating and 'membering all the good stuff. Thought so too till I zoomed in.  You see, we all wanna go back to when we were kids. Simple ideas like a big man to protect us, keep us safe. Instead of a fresh new Star Wars we want the old, just recycled and plopped in our tummies. Does this look familiar?  
 That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried. Uh, there has to be something. Damn it!  These things are impossible to get rid of.  Nothing kills these things! They're not in the jar?  That's it. Look, it's over.  Even if we've found a way to eradicate them now, we don't have time to implement it nation-wide.  You're gonna have to talk to them.  you're gonna have to speak from the heart: not make it about you. You know what these things are capable of. Even if you lose the election, another one like you is gonna rise up and take your place. J.J. Abrams is seeing to that. All I know is that for the future of our country, you're gonna have to give one last speech: the speech that everyone needs to hear, a speech where you finally just talk like a normal human being. 
What have you done?! You maniacs!  This isn't how it was supposed to happen. Garrison! Garrison, what the fuck have you done?!  Where is he?!  Do you have any idea what you've done to our country?! You admitted you didn't know how to run a country! You agree people were supporting you just because they like the new Star Wars, and you begged me to help you lose! No it wasn't!! Something else has to have happened!! There's nothing great about rehashing all the old Star Wars moments into a new-  I, I suppose... I suppose I can watch it one more time. Give it another chance. Well, I don't know about you guys, but I sure am excited. America is going to be great again. Aren't you excited, gang? Aww, come on, Shelly. We've learned that women can be anything. Except for President. Have you really watched it, Sharon? It has more to offer than just nostalgia. Let's all watch it again tonight. 
Yeah. Yeah, fuck Denmark. No,  but there is somebody he will still listen to. 
There's been a lot of hurting in our country lately.  And I'm her husband Randy. I do the construction and practice MMA in my spare time.   What we're thinking is to take out the wall between the kitchen and living room for a more open concept.  there's never a dull moment.  So guys, are you ready to see your renovation?!  On White People Renovating Houses.  Janet and Dave Fitzsimmons are looking to move from their dated two-story colonial home. What we're thinking here is taking out the wall between the kitchen and living room to give you an "open concept". Then we'll give you lots of space to entertain with an updated kitchen island and bar stool.  What the hell is that?  What the hell are you doing? 'Kay, cool. Could you do that somewhere else? Tryin' to do a home renovation show here. Cool, thanks, guys. [goes back inside and closes the door] And now back to White People Renovating Houses.   Oh, Goddammit! Not these dipshits again!  Will you assholes knock it off?! Don't you know every time you wave Confederate flags around, you make the rest of us look stupid?! Put the flag down unless you wanna get pepper-sprayed!  Agh. Ah, dammit!  Damnit, knock it off! Ow! Your honor, we have a TV show called White People Renovating Houses. We named it that well before these guys decided to start taking our brand and run it through the gutter! People are gonna start associating White People Renovating Houses with their hateful stupidity! All the other names were taken, your honor! Everyone's got a flipping show.  we built our show into something! We're trying to help people, and it's impossible with these guys waving a Confederate flag every chance they get! Hey hey hey heeey! Stop it! Stop it!  I came to make a truce. Now look, there's been a lot of hurt here. Hurt from both sides. It's time to end it. What if I told you... I could get you all jobs? No, I've spoken to everyone in the community, and they've agreed to go along with my plan. I believe I have a solution to all of this. So, Heather and Mike, what we're thinking is to take out this wall between your kitchen and your living room to give you a more open concept, with space to entertain. So let's talk about materials. What'd you pick out, Sharon? Hey Darryl, add Bella Terra quartz slabs to our shopping list. And what about the back splash, Sharon? Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tiles to our shopping list.  Hey Darryl, add Carrara su- Huh, that's- that's not what I said.  Hey, Darryl, add Carrara subway tile to my shopping list! Well, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get? Hey, Darryl, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get? Hey, Darryl, sorry, but you did not go to college, so you have to take the jobs you can get. Hey, Darryl. Hey, Darryl! Coal mining and truck driving are not exactly jobs of the future, so add Carrara subway tile to my fucking shopping list!  Hey Darryl, you're supposed to be at work. Hey Darryl, come on. Everyone else is tryin' to make this work, and all you keep doing is ma-  Hey Cleetus, volume down. Hey Cleetus, define "expunged".  Whoa. What the hell was that all about? I think something's going on with Darryl. If we're gonna get anywhere, we better figure out what. Darryl?  Darryl, come on! Everyone's trying to work things out but you! You're stuck in another time, afraid to change no matter how necessary that change may be! Why are you so closed-minded? Don't you see that these walls have to be broken down before any progress can be made? Oh, God, Darryl, I- Jesus, Darryl. I'm- I'm sorry. I-  Things are different now. It'll be harder, but you can change. You just have to demolish what's there and start over. No.  Hyah!  All right, Darryl, we've certainly been through a lot and I know you're anxious. Are you ready to see your new home? Well Darryl, what do you think? You like the breakfast nook? And where you used to have your gun case, look at what Sharon did.  Well, it is real and now you've got the space in your home to entertain all your friends and family. Come on in, guys! }} 
 Okay, Stan, you got your phone? I need to call everyone on this list. They all live in the same city. Stan, it's not right that people celebrate a man who wiped out millions of people for his own glory!  Okay, next one, come on. Get calling, Stan! You have to overdo it in today's society Stan. You can't be nuanced and subtle anymore or else critics go "Wow, what was the point of that?"  Hi, Francis Melman? Hey, how are you, you fuckin' racist? Good evening. Well, I just have a problem with the racist people of this city. Yeehaw,  I'm from New York! I drive around a big circle n' celebrates a guy who murdered Native Americans! Shoowee! I don't care if people get indigenous, I'll crap all over their statues! I'm the one who's indigenous that this landmark even exists! Not now, Stan. I'm working on a proposal to change British Columbia to just British. Where did you get that? Look, that was a long time ago, okay? It's just a dumb Halloween costume. Look, I was younger! We were all... younger. It was another time. You have to understand, it was 2013. Everyone was stoked on Columbus back then. If you guys found those pictures online, it's only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won't care about what I do now. They'll just see me as a thoughtless, indigenous son of a bitch.  What's the point, Sharon? Soon they're gonna be coming after me. Hell fucking yes I'm in. Alright, everyone's here. Let's do this.  All right, everybody. Hey, thanks for comin'. If uh-I can have your attention, please? I think we're ready to get started. Yeah, I know, but I just, I was really excited, wanted everyone to witness my test. Okay, great. I'm very interested to see [begins speaking more slowly] what those results have to say. Shelly! We've got an emergency! We're getting rid of all the Columbus stuff in this house! Any Columbus costumes? Columbus pictures? They all gotta go! Sharon! Peter Galtman called! He sounds suspicious! We've gotta get rid of all our Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups! Where are they?! Shot, shot glasses, coffee cups, towels, plates. What about the Columbus figurine salt and pepper shakers?  Sharon, do you know what they'll do to us when they find out how we were so stoked on Columbus?? Oho, really?! Did you forget our wedding?! That's you, right there!  Standing there with a big smile on your face! You didn't say anything about it being insensitive then, did you?!  Oh... nooo, nonononono. Thank you. Lo-lovely flowers. Thank, thank you.  Sharon, have you seen my Columbus staff and orb? Sharon, Galtman called again. Somebody's out there trying to get me in trouble! Everyone was excited about Columbus! For some reason people are just pointing fingers at me! Just because he's suddenly not cool now doesn't mean I'm gonna be the effin' scapegoat!  I've gotta burn this stuff!  Oh Goddamnit! Will you get out of here?!  I didn't kiss you 'cause I liked you! Okay, okay That's it! Get off my property!  Get off my land, you piece of shit!  Don't post that.  Shit!  Sharon, good news! The people from the DNA test called. They're on their way over. You wanna come down? You sure? These results could be really interesting.  Oh Goddammit, what the hell do you want? Crap, it's them!  Get over here! I don't have any feelings for you. Do you understand?!  NO! No buts! There is nothing here! I'm not in love with you! Got it?! Good! Now leave!  Hi, sorry. You guys have my results? Well what? You found something there you didn't expect to find? What is it? Do it again? That's not fair. Agh-uh oh, okay, no problem.  Okay! Okay, all set. Let's do this. Aaaaa- An anal swab? Give me tuh, three minutes.  Oh, aw shit.  Whoa, ha-hay.  Chillin', chillin'. Oh, you did? Oh, great. Sure, why not? Uh, I'm here. Huh let's uh, let's do that.  Really? Like Native American? Like a, like a little bit? Nnnuts!   Awww. Neander-thal? What the hell is that about? Wiped out? All of my people? Cross-breeding? You mean rape. You're telling me that my ancestors were raped, and then eradicated by you? You maniacs!   You find this funny, Galtman! Nobody had the guts to tell me what happened to my people, huh? Get the hell out of here!  Waww God! Yeah, sure! Everyone gang up on the Neanderthal! Isn't it funny!  Mr. Galtman, I haven't been honest. It's time for us all... to be honest. What is a holiday? It's a day off work, yes. A day off school. But holidays are also meant to be a time to reflect. Today, I'm happy to announce that the school calendar committee is reinstating the day off.  But instead of glorifying anyone, Let us make it a holiday about the negative feelings that we all sometimes feel. Say what we're really thinking so we can move on. And so, the second Monday in October will still be a holiday, but instead of Columbus Day, it will be for ripping on each other and tearing each other down. And we will call it Indigenous Peoples Day. For perhaps if we all do it at the same time, we won't be so indigenous the rest of the year. And since this is the second Monday of October, let's all embrace the new meaning of the holiday starting right now. That's the spirit, Dave. Come on, everybody, let's just all be totally indigenous. Come on! Good one Kurt. Your wife's a whore. Come on, everyone! Indigenous People's Day! Let's go for it! Okay, I will in a second, fatso. All right, who else? Come on! Get it out of your system! Happy Indigenous People's Day, everyone. Suck my asshole!}} 
And who are these kids? Does anyone know? They're wearing capes and forcing objects into their own rectal cavities? Why? Facebook? How so? That'll never happen. You know what I say we do? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg to come and talk to us all about our concerns in this community. We did.  We invited Mark Zuckerberg to town. Poop in his mouth! 
Stan, Grandpas has a lot of needs that we can't provide him here. He needs professional supervision. Oh really? Do you have any idea how much money we pay to have Grandpa in that place? Your grandpa is stylin'! Can you imagine being able to just sit around all day and not have to do anything but eat and watch TV? Jesus, Stan! It's not like he's in jail! I can't! I'm too busy busting my ass to pay the bills for that place, and to pay for your guitar lessons! I don't want to go there. It's depressing. Aw you tricked me. Well, it's really great seeing you, Dad. Guess we oughtta hit the road soon. Aw Jesus, now we know where Stan gets his guilt trips from!  Yes. Yeah, we love coming here. Wugh.  We're never visiting here again. 
Hey Sharon, did you see the box of Jack Daniels? What do you mean? Of course I am. Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys. We have some drinks. Come on, all the other guys' wives aren't being bitchy about it. Sup, witches!  Yep. Who's got the other stuff.  Yeah, right. We're gonna miss the first night of the party. Well, I got the Jack. Oh yeah! Jack and Crack Witch Week! Let's do this! And screw the Raiders too! No way. Check out Stephen, you guys. Oooooooooooooo.  Like real, how? That's pretty cool.  Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa. Oh. Hey, didn't see you there. Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened? Are you serious?!  God, I knew that guy was a fuckin' chode!  Nothin'. We were just hangin' out and talkin' and stuff, and then Chip got all weird. Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch! All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night. What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys. Why not? Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we're supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus!  Sup guys? I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy. A witch uhhh- Yeah, that's what it is!  "Park closed until further notice". That's bullshit! They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing! Yeah, sure, no.  You go over there. Sure, Stephen.  Okay, look. You're freaked out, it's understandable. Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun. Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy.  All right, Stephen. At least give us till tomorrow morning to talk to our wives and prepare them, all right? Can you just give us till morning? It's okay. It's okay.  Hey, it's Randy. We’ve got until tomorrow morning to sacrifice Stephen to the Devil. I'll explain later, just get everyone together. And, maybe bring just a little bit of crack. Hello, Stephen. We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do! Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right? Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out. No, seriously. No we wouldn't! Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.  
[rides up on his bike] ...Stranger Things. Stranger Things is the show. I saw it too. You saw It too? Jesus. I don't think anyone's imagining anything. I think the President IS here. You kids get inside somewhere. I have to warn the town! [gets on his bike and rides off, only to fall on his face a few seconds later.] Aw! Oh, for fuck's sake, White, he's running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids! Make her not funny for thirty years? What are you doing, Bob? [Randy is joined by Steven, Linda, Sharon and Roger] Have you been putting food out for the president? We all agreed not to feed him so he'd go away. Bob, come on. You have to know it's not safe to have him here. What's that got to do with anything, Bob? Come on. Bob, if Canada finds out the president is hiding here, they are going to nuke us. He needs to go. Give me the finger sandwiches. What? I'll do it. What the... Principal and Vice Principal...? But... But you two work togeth... You two work togeth... [Vomits] The Principal and the Vice Principal! [He takes off his hood] Sharon... I... I... The... There's... Ugh... You don't want to know. The Principal and Vice Principal are, like... together. [Sharon vomits right onto Randy's face.] Aw! Bob, for the love of Pete, our country is about to go to war! He's not saving Christmas, Bob. He's running around scaring your kids and shitting in the woods. Come on, Bob. What's best for your daughter? I mean, really? I don't know. I guess... It's up to the Whites. 
 What happened at school today? Who shot up the schoo-  was it you? Did you get shot? Oh...  Well, what's this about failing a math quiz? I'm sorry, Sharon. I...  Hey, Sharon, ya... doin' okay? Uh huh, and... what else is goin' on?  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sharon. ...Hun, uh...  When was your last...? I mean, you know how sometimes things can seem like a little bigger deal 'cause you know, your... down there? I mean, I'm just, I'm just pointing out that it is around that time. Okay. Okay, love you, honey. I'll leave you alone.  I agree with my wife. ...Anybody need a drink?  Everything's going fine, and then at a certain time of the month I have to start walking on eggshells. It's just. it's just once I'd like her to acknowledge it, you know? Just once say "You know, maybe I was overreacting a little bit 'cause of my hormones."  Okay, Sharon. Cool. Nuh-nothing. I love you, sweetheart. I don't know. I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's like, I turn on the TV and dread they'll say something about a school shooting because it's gonna set my wife off.  What... what do you mean? Menopause? I don't even know what that is. Uh huh. But... if a woman isn't having periods anymore, then why would she still overreact and be bitchy? Well wait, you're saying this could actually get worse?  Oh my God! How long does it last? You... you got your period? You just got your period this morning? Soooo the past few days, maybe you have been just a liiittle- Aw guys, uh she didn't mean it! She just... get, give her a...  Sure, honey. I know, sweetheart, I know.  Aaaaah? Aaah? Aaaaah? Aaaah. Aaaaaah.  What is it? Shuh-should we get down there?  
Come on, guys, we don't wanna be late! We're all going. Come on!  Church is important, Stan. Way more important than video games and TV. Church is about community and coming together. A lot of things. Yeah. Me too. Hey, mornin' Stephen, Linda. You got it- hey, where's Josie? Aw, she's gonna miss church? That's too bad. Give her my best.  Kind of like a priest in a room full of naked boys.  Oh, that was a great one, Nelson. Salvation in a little boy's mouth. I'm gonna post that one for sure.  Yeah, well, I used to think that about church when I was a kid too. Hey, don't say things like that, Stan! You wanna go to fuckin' Hell?  Hang on! Hang on! I gotta post this! This is hilarious!  Four boys and a priest playing a board game! Nononoait, let me get the picture.  Aw shit, I missed it! Hey, mornin' Mackey! Ah, doin' better, huh, Josie? All right.  It's not open. Hey! Hey, it's nine o'clock! Hey!  Hey...  Well this sucks. What are we supposed to do without church? Shut up, Shelley! What's it all about, huh? Are we just bags of carbon and water put on this planet for no purpose? You're born, you die, then you're just... food for the worms. The church is back open?  Hey! What uh, what are you guys doing? Last week? No, he was at my house a couple of days ago playing board games with the boys. Boring  Father!  Hey, hey Sharon, it's Father! He's back! Hey, Father's back! Oh uh, no. I haven't seen, Butters. Or Stan. But Father, please, we all need church. Please, Father, we're all lost, and the cleanup crew hasn't helped at all.  Stephen! Stephen, listen! The boys are missing! Fr. Maxi thinks they've been taken by the other priests!  But seriously, we have to find these guys! The boys are in danger! What-what'd she say? Can, can I post that? Yeah I'll bet.  Kind of like how getting raped by a Catholic priest is undeserved.  Oh God, it's good to have my faith back! 
 My God... He'll have to find a place that accepts racist, awful beings like him. There are still places out there who don't care about bigotry and hate. 
Exactly what kind of trouble is Shelly in, Mr. Mackey? Her butthole??  Why would the recess monitor want a picture of my daughter's butthole?! Jesus Christ, how much worse can things get around here?! Seriously?! Dog's butthole?! That's what we're doin' now, huh?! There's not enough bad things in the world, we get called into school, "Here's a dog's butthole for ya." That's what it's all come to, Shelly?!  I am seriously over it. Don't you just wanna start over? Go back to simpler times? I've had it. School shootings, pieces of shit taking Ambien and tweeting, priests raping kids, and somehow... I'm not laughing anymore. Let's do it, Sharon. What I've always talked about. Let's get out of here. Go buy a farm and live off the land. Never been more serious.  Let's move out to the country. Go back to simple living when things mattered, like hard work and 'tegridy. By growing things and, and selling what we make with our hands. We can do this, Sharon. It's time. Mornin' Joe? How's the farmin'? Well that's fine, Joe, just fine. I'm growin' some Green Willy Stranger myself. And the Catatonic Tegridy Bud is takin' well.  So long, Joe!   Name is right there on the sign. Come on back! Now, what about the Tegridy Jungle Bud? Yeah? Yeeahh?!  All right!  Howdy. What can I do ya for? Yeah, name's right there on the sign. Really? Hey, that'd be great. What kind of company-   Oh no, sorry. I don't want my Tegridy Bud put in those pussy sticks. Yeah, you know. Penis pens, wussy vape, lady joints. Not on my farm, no sirree. That's nice. Now how's about you take that pussy stick and get off my farm before I shove it up your ass and you're blowin' mist out your butthole?  Yeah, whatever. All you're doin' is blowin' smoke -- Sorry, "fruity steam." Pussy. Go vape some more, ya fuckin' puss! Whatcha doin', Joe? Just like that, huh? You gonna let those people with pussy sticks take over everythin'?! Oh. I hope you didn't pack your tegridy, 'cause clearly, Are you still here?! Agh!  Isn't this great, Stan? Livin' off the land?  Well you see that? We're talkin' now.  When was the last time we really talked like this? Ithink we're havin' a breakthrough moment. I want to give you somethin', son. Somethin' I made that I want you to have.  It's a hemp hat. Come on, let's just see how it fits. Here, just-just look. Just try it.  Whoa. Bless us, Lord, and our little cannabis farm, and may we always keep our tegridy. Amen.  So, how was everyone's day?  With a WHAT?! Stan had a vape pen?!   Where did you get this?! Yeah, right! My own son using a pussy stick!  Don't you know what these things are doin' to our way of life?! I've had enough! You think I'm just gonna stand around while they destroy my family?! We've worked this farm and this land for over four days! I'm not about to let some vape queens take it all away from us!   All right, you bunch of vape-smoking' pussies! You try and take my way of life?! Time to show you some tegridy!   Get your stupid mist out of my fucking face! Yup!   I don't think so! Just what the Sam Hell you boys doin' here?! It's good you came clean, son. It shows that you've got-  Yeah. She taught me somethin' else too! If you're gonna fight for your tegridy, don't forget to bring a towel. Yeah!   Well, shit. Looks like we made it to another sunrise. Yup son. I think the fight's just startin'. Farmers like us are under attack. 
Yehello? Oh, I see. You want a place to hide on Halloween night, and you thought out here on the farm you'd be safe. You think them fancy e-scooters don't make it out here? We're gonna be bombarded just like you city folk. I gotta keep what I have.  
Hey!  What the hell are you guys doin' on my farm? A bear?  
 Stan?! Come on. Get out of sight.  Your mom's been out trying to find you a lawyer and a therapist. We've been doing all we can! What are you talking about? It was just a bear. What? Why? I dunno? What? A little bit. I mean... when I'm not doing all this stuff for you Sorry, I needed a little break! I'm a little high, yes! Oh what?! I'm sorry! I'm sorry that I need to decompress with all this shit going on!  Well at least I'm not a school shooter! Oh whatever!  "ManBearPig! ManBearPig!" You sound like your freakin' grandpa! He had been talking about ManBearPig comin' since I was fuckin' 14. Nothin' new. Do you know how to craft stamina tonics?  
I have a weed business to run! I need my shit from Amazon to make it all work! Oh yeah, that's typical rhetoric from a Marxist box. 
I can't even believe you would say that, Sharon! It's the stupid Amazon strike! I rely on things for marketing, Sharon! A small business needs products for exposure, and until those assholes go back to work, small businesses are gonna suffer!   Aw yeah yeah, Of course. Out early today, huh?  Yeah, tell me about it. Uh, yeah.  You're strikers? Okay, okay, hold on. Uh, let me got some more weed.  Huh.  All right, there you go, friend. That's an ounce of weed, and thanks for supportin' small business. Next? Sorry friend, that's the law. Us simple farmin' folk respect the law and each other.  Well don't buy weed from them. Their weed sucks. Shit! This whole Amazon strike has more people smoking weed than ever. We have to make sure Tegridy Weed stays ahead of the competition! Yeah, like a, like a delivery service. Some way so people don't have to drive out here and even see the other weed farms! You mean the things that almost killed us all on Halloween? Yeah, I 'member.  Oh shit. We could have Tegridy all over town.   Bezos! Bezos! Hello Bezos! You can take your fulfillment center and fulfill it right up your ass! See, there's one thing you didn't count on, and that's Tegridy! Just look in the eyes of these people!  Everyone has Tegridy now! Tegridy that you will never understand! We aren't just different classes of people anymore, we are a town! Why do you ask that? Oh. Hang on.  Hold on. Okay, I got it. Anyways... you see, Tegridy is something that can't be understood by big corporations! Oh, they'll try to package Tegridy, but only I can really package Tegridy. I got more money now 'cause of Tegridy, and that's 'cause I figured out how to get Tegridy to everyone. And that's- now everyone is in their state of Tegridy that's impenetrable. Am I making sense? The point is, nobody's comin' to work for you! So you can take your whole plan and fulfill it somewhere else!  
 Ah, hahah-uhl, oh.  Looks like our orders are actually... down. You sure you did that right? Not ordering as much? Why... what the hell is going on?  Howdy, Stephen. How've you been gettin' on? Oh, it's early mornin's and lots of hard work, but, gotta do what's best for my young 'uns. I've noticed you haven't supplied up in a while, Stephen, so I thought I'd deliver your weed to you personally. Why not? You're not gettin' all sober on us, are ya? Ohhh he, haha, hey... fuck you. My weed not good enough for ya? Something wrong with Tegridy? You're stealing my idea Stephen! Yeah-huh! While you assholes were all screwing around, I went out and made a living! When you grow your own pot, you're taking weed out of my children's mouths!  What seeds?!   Yeah, that's right! Yeah, that's right. Me too. Yeah, that's right! Yeah, that's right. Yeah! Come on! That's right. Drown babies, yeah. Drown babies, that's right. Drown babies. Tegridy.  Stupid government! How can they sit there and look a child in the face and it's fine for people to grow their own weed?! Why does it? Ugh! Am I the only person here who understands what this will do to us?! You know what? Fuck South Park! Yeah, I'm sick it! I'm just- I'm done! I don't give two shits about South Park! All that matters is Tegridy Farms now! Ah, sorry, tours at 11 and 2, and 4:20. Ohh, I told you rich, big-city folk before: You can't buy Tegridy! Yeah, I think so.  What do you want with me?  So you guys wanna team up and piggyback on the goodwill of the legalization movement for some good old-fashioned crony capitalism? I'm totally in.  Yes, Towelie. I'm working on a merger with Med Men. We have a deal in the works to help each other put a stop to home-growers once and for all. That's because I'm the president of the company, and YOU are a TOWEL! What is wrong with trying to protect our business?  I AM NOT A TOWEL! I'm not a towel!  Ah. Augh! Aaaaawwww!! Well, gang. Looks like Tegridy Farms are turning big profits again. We're on our way to becoming the biggest weed brand in the country. I'm not getting pushed around now, you got it? So go on. Anybody here wants to call me a towel, just go ahead and do it! Go on, Sharon. Call me a towel. Best towel you ever had, bitch! 
  You guys, I've just had the greatest idea ever! No! I've been trying to figure out how to make more money selling weed. And last night, it came to me. We could grow the family business by selling Tegridy... to the Chinese.  What's this Saturday? Everyone?  Stan, you need to wear your Tegridy T-shirt at the performance. Stan, they're available on Amazon starting Friday, so you could really help promote the family business while I'm gone!  First time goin' to China?  It's my first time. I'm goin' out to try and drum up a little "business." What are you headin' out for? Ohhh, huhuh, heeeyy. Fuck you. I, I had that idea like three days ago. So when did you come up with it?   It's okay, it's okay. I'm sure there's plenty of Chinese people for all of us.  Oh that? That's weed. Marijuana. You know.  Ah, here. Here we go. Jay shi daamaa Tegridy Weed.  Uh hey, don-don't forget my suitcase! C-could you grab my suitcase? All my weed is in there! Excuse me! Jay shi daamaa! Aaaugh. I am a proud member of the Communist Party, The Party is more important than the individual.   Who, who's there? No, I don't have any honey. Are you prisoners here? Jesus. What kind of madhouse is this? Your Honors, I'm just a simple farmer, from a simpler time. Now, I've never been to China before, but I hate to say I'm a little disappointed in all of you. From what I've seen, you seem to treat your people like dirt. You don't believe in any individual freedoms. I mean, you got Winnie the Pooh and Piglet in jail! Now, come on, China! You know, a country ain't nothin' unless it's got decency and in-tegrity! And I think I speak for Pooh and Piglet and all of Disney when I say you could use some 'tegrity, China!  Now, it just so happens that I own a Tegridy farm. And I think I might be able to work out a deal for all you nice folk. Uhhh, that's me. Randy Marsh No, I'm from ''South Park''. Hey, hold on a minute! Do you really think this business should be run through intimidation and fear?! Whatever happened to old-time values?! You already have business with the Chinese. You have all the connections money can buy! But there's one thing you don't have. That's Tegridy. Now, it just so happens- They didn't listen at all? But I... wuh-why not? But for what? What if we took their side, then? What if we showed China that we understand how they feel to be made fun of on the Internet? Well, gang, looks like the family business is starting to really turn the corner. I don't know about you, but I, for one, think the world is gonna be a better, and safer, place, now that China finally has Tegridy. Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh- Oh, yeah, I did kill Winnie the Pooh.  Where are ya goin', Stan? Ooo, about me? Make sure it talks about me bringing Tegridy to China!}} 
<poem><i>Happy 300 thousand dollars.</i></poem> Can you believe it, gang? We've broken $300,000 selling weed.  "stupid" idea. Now we're living the dream.  Who wants shots?! [jumps into the scene] How many thousand dollars has Tegridy Farms made selling weed? $300,000!  We've got $300,000, just selling  Well? What'd you think, guys? Who cares, Sharon? Business is up. Yeah. We make money either way.  Shelley!  Stan! Mrs. Cartman? Whoa whoa! What's goin' on? Okay, okay. Come on. Let's get you inside and get you some weed.  Believe me, I know how that feels.  You try to do what's best for your family and all you do is get shit on. [hands the joint to Liane] That's just it.  When it comes to families, we have to do what we think is best. All-county immunization roundup? What's that? It's just... it's like, can't people see us trying to do what's best for my family? I'm trying to provide for them by running a business. I'm sorry if I make mistakes. And I get it from both sides, because my family's pissed off at me too. No, you don't!  No, you don't! Nobody understands. Yeah, like, everybody's doing business with China. It's like "get over it." I am. I'm afraid I haven't been very kind to that partner lately. I think maybe it's time for an apology. Where are you going? Do you remember we used to come here and look over the town lights together? I brought you here to apologize, Towelie. I let the money go to my head. I... I got greedy and I started acting like a towel. I need you back. I need Tegridy back, the way it used to be. No more harassing homegrowers. No more Med Men. China's actually a free and loving country that- [gets out of the car and chases after him] Wait, wait, Towelie, come on! I need you! Okay, okay. No more selling to the Chinese.  Fuck the Chinese government. Fuck the Chinese government! There! Hahaha! This is it. This is the moment that Tegridy Farms got back on track. 
Good morning, everyone. 'morning. So, listen guys. We are not in good shape. The whole "doing business in China" thing has sort of bitten us in the ass,  how do we sell more weed? Stan. Not good enough! Shelly?! Nice attitude! How do we sell more weed? Sharon? Right. Cut out all our marketing. That's Sharon's great idea, everyone. Towelie? Go on. Mulch.  Everyone, great job. You just got powned by a towel. How much do you think we'll get for our mulch? This is gonna save our business. I'm really hungry all of a sudden. You want some Burger King? Uh, hi, can I get, um, large onion rings... the big Coke Zero and, um... What's an Impossible Burger? Plant-based? You mean, it's not like a cow? Hoh. Okay, I'll try it.  Hey. This tastes like shit. You guys make money off of this? Aw that, that's amazing. I mean, this seriously tastes like dog shit, and you get people to buy it?  Wait a minute... Plant-based... Plant... based... Plant-based. Oh my God. Gerald, thanks for coming! You're not gonna believe this! Come on come on come on.  It's a Tegridy burger. Go ahead, try it.  Well? Yeah. It's plant-based. But keep eating it, though. Wait for it. Wait for it... Yeah ha ha? Yeah, right? And you can eat a lot of them and not feel bloated. Towelie's had like 12.   Burgers! Get your burgers here! Plant-based burgers for sale! Get your hamburgers here!  Plant-based burgers for sale! I'm sellin' hamburgers. All-natural, completely plant-based.  Thank you, sir. Yeah, you sell hamburgers here. Tegridy Burger. Made locally right here in South Park. Tegridy Burger. Eating meat doesn't just hurt animals. It hurts people. It takes 13 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of animal meat. All that plant food could be used much more efficiently if-m, if people just ate it directly. Meat is also not environmentally friendly. Meat production is wasteful and causes enormous amounts of pollution. And the meat industry is one of the biggest...  that adopting a vegan diet is way more effective than switching to a greener car in the fight against climate change. For your health, for our planet, for the animals and for each other, we have to switch to plant-based foods. Now, it just so happens-  It's our Grand Opening! Come and visit your town's only plant-based burger joint! Celebrate our Grand Opening! Tegridy Burger! Cheeba cheeba. Cheeba cheeba. Excuse me? Well I'm sorry, Mr. Cow Killer, but this is called "evolution." Uh ho, hehey, fuck you!  I don't know what we're gonna do. These cows are eating all our weed and they're shitting everywhere. They're gonna put us completely out of business! Nobody wants cows anymore! They're bad for climate change!  We gotta kill 'em. They're ruining our burger business! We gotta kill all these cows! Look, it's not gonna be easy. It's not something anyone wants to do but... we're just gonna have to get really, really high. Yeeheeyeah!  Yeah, you know, we're all just -- We're all just bein' healthy and ethical over here!  Huh? Huhuhuh!  Oh, hey. Fuck you! Oh, they were -- They were just -- We didn't eat 'em! 
 Well? You all excited, gang? Ugh, this isn't any Halloween, because this week, Tegridy Weed is doing a Halloween special. It's big promotional thing. Everyone's gonna love it. Hey, wuh-where's Shelly? Why?  Hey, Shelly? Can I talk to you for a minute? Come on, kiddo.  Shelly, we need to talk about your marijuana problem. You know, what's your problem with it? Yes, we all know, but ugh, why? Shelly, the truth is, some of the most important people in the world smoke weed. Did you know that Snoop Dogg smokes weed? Ugh, way more people enjoy marijuana than you think, okay? Okay, who's your idol? Who do you most look up to in the whole world? Total stoner. High as a kite. Every tennis match. You don't know that, Shelly! Now you're just making assumptions!  Whoa! Whoa! Wait just one second! Are you actually saying that hemp, a classification of cannabis  Hold the freaking phone! You're telling us that marijuana has been used throughout the centuries-? No, I d-, I'm just, I'm surprised that- And, and it is, Shelly. We're havin' a great time!  It's just so hard being a parent sometimes, you know? I've tried everything to get through to my daughter. I took her to a laser show, I played her all of Dark Side Of The Moon, but... it's like... it's like there's something in her head that just doesn't get it! It's just- I have to live my life, you know? I can't let her problems with marijuana drag me down anymore. So, anyway, hey. How's the Halloween Special comin' along? It's ready? O-ho wow! The Halloween Special! I'm so excited to try it.  Oh, wow, that is nice! I'd like to see anyone compete with this Halloween Special. Oh, man, I really like it. It's really smooth. This is so good that we shold stop smoking it right now. We don't want to ruin our Halloween experience, you know?  AAAAAAA! Shelly! No! Nooo!! I just need some time, okay, Towelie? Alright, Towelie, what is this ab-? Whoa!  The Halloween Special!  Yeah! We're back! Yeah! Yeah! Okay, that should be enough Halloween Special for the first few people . What what?   You're going to a book fair? On fucking Halloweed?  You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?! I will not! I have things to get ready, and nobody cares about books on Halloween, Shelly! OH MY GOD!   It's a nightmare! It's a personal hell! I've done everything I can, as a father, to help he with her problem, but she just ignores everything I say! I can't do this! Oh, Shelly, I love you! Her mother doesn't say anything anymore! Whenever I bring up our daughter's marijuana problem, my wife says "I'm gonna lose my mind if you bring this up again." It's destroying all of us! I just think, maybe a night in jail is the wakeup call that she needs. I'm barely gonna have fun at the Halloween Special now! It's gonna be really hard for me to rage knowing you're in here, Shelly. It's gonna be really hard for me to rage!  Hey, come on in, guys! There's candy and hot dogs! Samplers of the special are there on the table, guys. Feel free to light up! Okay, I'll hold down the fort.  Naw, you see, fluvial geomorphology deals with the way rivers change over time. It's geology shit. It's why I got out of it, really. Oh! That's a company secret, my friend! Hey, are you alright there, buddy?  Towelie! There's something wrong with thte special! Oh Jesus! What happened?!    Ooooohh! Winnie the Pooh! Winnie the Pooh! There's monsters everywhere! It's some kind of curse! Unspeakable evil! All different kindds of monsters! Zombies and plant people and bears! Oh my God! What's that?! Oh my God, it's Harvey Weinstein! He's got me! You've got to-argh! He's inside me! Harvey Weinstein is inside me! You've gotta send help! People are dying everywhere! No! Harvey, I said no! Please, somebody co-  Oh God, it's the cows we killed! Get 'im off of me! Get 'im off of me! Oh my God! Get 'im off of me!  Waugh! Get 'im off of me! Get 'im off of me! Augh! We gotta fight them, Towelie! Waugh! We're going to live! We're going to live!  Hey, guess I slept in late, huh? What time is it?  Ooof, wow. That was some strong-ass Halloween Special, y'all. I mean... I saw rapists in the hot tub, zombie cows. I thought I was gonna die, and then, this fat, bitchy angel came and put me to bed.  Did everyone enjoy the Halloween Special? Oh. Well, that was pretty much my target audience anyway.  
What do you think you're-? My show! My Tegridy Farms show! Hello, Mayor. Mr. and Mrs. Tweek, ... Mackey. Yah, Mexican Joker. That was terrible.  Well, that's ridiculous. Guys, I have nothing against homegrowers. Hm...  Enough of Tegridy Farms? South Park is NOTHING without Tegridy Farms! I didn't do anything wrong!  Hi, Mr. Ga- Mr. President, Uh, I'm really sorry to bother you. Look, uh... I'm in a bit of trouble. Yeah, they uh, someone got some supposed evidence on me doing something... "illegal" and uh. Y-yeah, of course. Did I what? Uh, uhm, "Hey, you! You blew up people's yards who were growing their own marijuana!" "You, you illegally damaged property and made your business-" Jeez, you're really good at that. Look, what I really need from you is some personnel. Do you know any good lawyers? Look, doctor. You have to give me something. I'm really sick. I'm like, starting to question things that I've done. Like, starting to question the person I've become. And I can't sleep at night I, I just lay in my cell wondering if I've been a bad father lately, and a bad husband, and... please, it really hurts. I need some marijuana. I just need a little medicinal weed and these symptoms will all go away. You need to turn your life around! Clearly you have the addiction problem and I'm just your whipping boy! Ahh, poop! I've had a lot of time to just sit in here and think. I'm starting to realize I have this pattern of behavior where I... always want more. More weed, more drinks, more deals with the Chinese. It's never enough. See, I've always had my flaws, but at the end of the day, I cared about people. You know what the President said? He said just deny everything and make yourself the victim. Yeah, well... maybe he's part of how I got here. Maybe the President has brought down my moral meter. I don't mean to cast blame - I'm to blame - but... ever since he was elected, I've compared my morals to his. And no matter how awful I am, I'm never as bad a the President, so I'm... okay. I do? Oh. Thanks, but I think I'm just gonna plead guilty. Oh. Ohhh. Yeahhh.  Yeah, I have some words to say! I can't believe I'm being attacked here! You people are monsters! The evidence shows me in a yard taking a dump! Yes! Because I was setting a trap for Mexican Joker!  A bunch of... No... No, I can't do this. You wanna know what really happened? The President... sent me his lawyer, and his lawyer told me what to say to get off and gave me a joint in prison. And then I smoked that joint! And you know what I thought?! I thought "this is some shitty-ass weed." It wasn't Tegridy. It barely even changed my mental state. The reason I got into the marijuana business was to make quality, simple weed that came from the heart. Weed that was strong, and pure. Somewhere on that journey I lost my way. Tegridy weed is about community. It's a sunrise. It's the smile on a baby. But most of all  Thank you. It feels really good to have these charges dropped. Now we can all get back to the business of trying to heal. I'd like to...  Well gang, I guess that's about it, huh? It's been a really good run, but, looks like the season is over. Well sure, the first snow is falling, crops are pretty much dead. Well what'd you all think, huh? I think the season was a little better than anyone expected. I really wanna thank you guys for a great run.  
Hello, Mayor,... everybody. What are you doing here? For what? Guys, my season is over. Tegridy Farms' season ended weeks ago. ...You want me to do a... Christmas special? But guys, look behind you.  The crops are dead. How am I supposed to sell weed to people now? Tegridy. Well, you're right about that. Let me call my marijuana science specialist and.... I'll see what I can do. So we use the greenhouse. There's gotta be a way to make a Christmas special. It's what everyone wants. That's 'cause people really didn't like Mexican Joker. I'm not gonna just repackage it. That's not special. Nagh.  Well howdy there, folks. Heard you were all a little down and might need a boost.  Just a little somethin' extra for a special kick. Oh, hi Mayor. What's going on? Are people not liking the Christmas special so far? Okay, okay, look, you busted us. It's a mix of different strains of marijuana we had left over from last season. I know, it's wrong... Oh that? That's cocaine. Yeah, I got the idea praying to Christ. You know, powder, snow, it's what gives Christmas Snow its kick.  Getting enough cocaine was the tricky part, so we started growing our own. Turns out the coca plant is even hardier than the marijuana plant. It can grow even when we're out of season. It is??  Hey hey, it's not a big deal. I've been through this before.  Hang on, I'll handle it. Don't go anywhere. Legalize it! Legalize it! Okay, cocaine's totally legal now. Yeah, legal in seven states including this one, and other states are soon to follow. I told you. It's 2019, dawg. Our Christmas special is so amazing, I don't know how we're gonna keep up with all the demand. We need more help. We're never gonna get enough done in time. Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley, can you help us make more labels for our Christmas special? Oh great. My daughter had a marijuana problem and now she has a problem with cocaine.  What the hell is this? Heheey, fuck you. Who has that kind of power? We can't sell marijuana during the holidays.  We can't give up on the Christmas special. People need it. I think I know a way around this. There you are, ma'am. There you are, sir. This is amazing, Towelie. Tegridy Farms is finally gonna make all the money I ever dreamed of.  O-ho!  Ohhhhh! Hey Santa. We need to talk. Santa, you don't understand. Santa, that's not just cocaine. It's Tegridy cocaine. That's not true! This cocaine is grown locally. By local people. Please, just try it! Please!  Right?  Please, Jesus. It's Tegridy. Hey guys, I'm so happy my Christmas Special turned out okay. 
Hey everybody. Can everyone hear me okay? Thanks for turning out, everyone. You know, we've all been through a lot these past several months. We've shut down and people have lost their businesses, lost their livelihoods. I also own a small business. I sell weed, and I have to say ... I'm actually doing pretty good. Amazing.  I think people are really excited. What do you think? What?  I'm doing positive to try and help. People really need this right now.  We'll see if they like my special.  Hi, you here for the special? Here you go.  Oh, hang on. Sorry, uh, didn't somebody say the pandemic special was a bad idea? Oh, come on, think about it. Do you even know anyone personally who's dying of COVID? Jimbo's a fat alcoholic who'd be in the hospital anyway. All I'm saying is that we let some dirty virus from "China" completely upend our lives and shut us down! Sharon, I went to China, remember? Last season? I went there to sell our weed and ended up hanging out with Disney and Mickey Mouse. You remember all that? I know what China's like. Doesn't surprise me all this shit came from there. HA. Told ya!   A bat in Wuhan? Hello. Oh, Oh hey!  To China! Boy, you sure know how to party, Mick! I think that's a bat. Hey, Mick? Where'd you go?  Oooh!  I gotta go!  Hey, it's Randy Marsh From, from Tegridy Farms? Look, um, do you remember when we fucked that bat in Wuhan? Well, I've only fucked one! I remember. Right after, I got really sick, and this was all back in October. You told me to fuck the bat! Nobody knew anything about COVID when I fucked the bat! I thought I just came back from China with the flu! Look, we can't let scientists find that bat. My wife is crazy. If she finds out I started the pandemic, she's gonna be a total bitch about it.  Uh... m-maybe. Oh yeah. Cool. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Okay. Okay okay, just stop!   Heyheyhey, whoa whoa! W-what are you guys doing?!  No! No. You know what? You guys are horrible! Just, just stop it right now! You guys-  What? What did he say? No bat involved. No bat involved!  Oh yeah! Oh yeah! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! In your face! In your face! It wasn't a bat! Okaaay, okaaay, Shhhh. Okay! I don't wanna think about that right now, Mickey! Then what? What the fuck is a pangolin?  Ha ha, ha whoa!  Okay, Okay. Oh, so now it was "rape." Yeah I'm a pandemic specialist. I'm making one right now.  Oh, okay. Oh, sorry.  Yeah thanks.  Why did you send that to me? Yeah, I know, but I can't just turn myself in! This is all your fault, Mickey Mouse! You made the deal with the devil when you sold your Mulan shit to China! And then you took me out and sold me on how great China was, and how we should all suck their dick! You made me lose my tegridy and anything special that I had-!  Special. Wait a minute. That's it! The Special. The Pandemic Special! That's how we can get my DNA into people! We can vaccinate them without them even knowing! Just give me a couple of more days before you have me killed. I-I think I know a way out of this. Shhh. Hey Jimbo. It's okay, Jimbo. I think I might have a cure for COVID.  Shhhh, this is gonna be great. It's okay, it's okay. Just breathe. Breeeathe.  It's okay. It's okay, breathe. Huh? Uh, what? What? They're probably in my pants pocket. Why? The hospital? For what? Jimbo's better? Holy shit.  It works. It can help.  Ogh. Ogh-o.  Ogh. Just...  what?! I'm doing something important, Sharon! People need this right now! What thing?  Huh. That's weird. No! Nonono! Don't call the doctor! They're busy. These are u-un- precedented times. W-we have no idea what caused this.  Everyone's talking about the special, Sharon. It's a big deal. He obviously needs it right now.  Nooo! Shit!  I just... gotta take all the Pandemic Special over to Thompson Lake and dump it. Because the Pandemic Special needs to end! A special has to end, Sharon, or else it's not really a "special," is it?!  Nono, okay, okay, okay, hold on! I'm coming!  Maybe we can just drop the special by the lake on the way. He's not dead, Sharon. No!  Oh my God. Oh God no.  They got Applebee's too. [turns to Sharon] Drive me back to the farm, Sharon. I need to get something.  Wait! Everyone just stop! I have something that might change all of this!  This... is what you've all be looking for, right? Well here! Go ahead and do all the tests you want on it. You'll find out... everything you need to know.  How do I even begin to apologize? You guys were right. I think all the marijuana really did go to my head. You said it: a drug is a drug, and... I'm not who I used to be. It's time for me to own up to everything. It's time everyone knew what started this pandemic.  ...You want nothing to do with the Pandemic Special. Uh huh.  I just... think maybe I'm gonna do a few more specials. You got some shit on your face.  
 So we still have some of the pandemic special, but the vaccination special is about out! Try 'em both -- the season is about over, guys! 
Making a difference can be fun! 
Let's go weed! Wew! Boycotting what? Wait... what? Ugh ahhug– Guys... I wanna have kind of a tough talk with you. We don't really have any black friends, we don't reach out to the black community. Shelley, you never bring any black dudes over. I mean, Stan, your three best friends are all white. Yes, that kid Token. How come you never hang out with him? In a group maybe, but I don't recall just you and Token ever doing anything. I've never seen Token here at the farm, just like the two of you guys. Why not? We'd like to think that, wouldn't we? But... actions speak louder than words, gang. I guess... I guess I just want you to think about it.  Ok, there we go. This is a farm fresh hemp salad sourced locally here at Tegridy! Alright, come on everybody, dig in. Well, you know, with our boys starting to become so close– we thought we better get the families together! If they're friends, then we need to be friends! Huh?  W-what are you talking about? Oh, that's so lame. No, we really just wanted to get to know you guys better since Stan is friends with Token. You know... just out of curiosity– why did you guys name him that? Well– I mean, it's just kind of an odd name, isn't it? Like, some people might think you guys naming your son that isn't very cool. Well I mean other people just think it's a little... I mean, come on, I mean, I'm– I'm not calling you guys racist, but– why did you name your son that?  His name is Tolkien?  Holy shit, that's what his name means?  Would you like to see how we grow and process our weed? You see, it's all about refinement. Here at Tegridy, we believe the best weed is untouched from the earth– so we distill it down to its basic essence. Over there are our clean out vats and up here we have our first stage drying racks. Oh, real quick!  It all takes about six days from the field to a jar that we can sell. So... what do you think? Yeah, it takes a lot. You know– I just had a crazy idea... Our boys are best friends now... Why don't you come work for Tegridy? Oh my gosh– I was just saying we could really use a co-executive of financial consulting! Look, I... Would it be okay if... If I sent you some of our receipts and you could help us– financial consult? Oh my God, this is amazing. Here's to the start of something wonderful. Would you like some free weed? Taking shit tons of Tegridy orders. Sales are going nuts right now. Because we work together? Yes, but then– you got promoted! I was gonna surprise you. Don't you see how lucrative this can be? I mean, we make a pretty damn good team in the weed business. I mean, we are Ben and Jerry– We're Ben and Jerry. You're Jerry, and I'm Ben. No, you're a towel. Doing dru– Do you remember when Bilbo first set out with the dwarves to fight Smaug? What's the first thing they all did? They partied their asses off.  Lucrative treasure. Ben and Jerry, my man. Ben and fuckin' Jerry. Not guilty, your honor. Not true, your honor. I've never even heard Paul McCartney's version. "Black Puppy White Puppy" is a song I wrote by myself on my piano keyboard.  Ohhhh, buzzkill... Okay, what is it? Uhh, yeah... no. Well, you're just– you know, you're just not the idea guy. Alright, look, I'm gonna tell you the truth about ice cream– Jerry actually doesn't do shit. Ben does it all, everyone knows that. Oh, come on, I'm sorry.  He doesn't even really sound like a black guy, you know that? Yeah, that's really cool boys– Wait, wha-a-a-t?!  What the hell's going on?! Credigree Weed? How stupid is that?! Credigree isn't even a word! Well, there's really good weed across the street! Tegridy weed? Oh, oh! He didn't even talk like that before! This guy is a total phony! Now just come across the street, and I'll show you some real nice weed made with Tegridy! These people don't even belong here!  They stole it! They stole my idea! Those dickheads across the street! They took everything I learned about using black culture to make a bigger profit and they're doing it themselves!  Get him outta here, he's a spy!  Hey, fuck face! I don't want your kid over at my house, you got that?! You want a war? Well, you got one! Game on, asshole!  Everyone back in the house. Come on, let's go. Shut up!  
Jesus Christ… Seems pretty dangerous. What if the police thought that gun was real? Oh, that's good. Oh, we got you a partner too, Eric. You might remember Stan's Uncle Jimbo. It's ok, I have an idea…   Should I take them out now? 
Hey whoa, whoa. What the fuck is going on? Hello?! It's St. Patrick's day. You guys this is Tegridy Weed's biggest day of the year. I need help with the St. Patrick's Day Special. Okay, yeah, great, don't worry about it, I'll do it all myself. Again.  This is God damn ridiculous. Piece a shit family.  Ugh, I'm just so stressed out! We have to make a huge profit today or the whole year is fucked. How's the St. Patrick's Day Special? Lemme see...  This is gonna be our best special ever! Come on, let's get the truck loaded up! Let's sell what we can from our drive up booth, and then later we can hit the Irish bar. What the fuck?  Hey! Excuse me! What do you think you're doing? No, you're not. So first you steal my idea of selling weed and now you're stealing my idea of doing a St. Patrick's Day Special! Is that right? Okay... Game on, motherfucker.    Oh. Uh... A very happy mornin', everybody! And a foine St. Patrick's Day to all of ye. I don't know if ya noohticed. But, uh, there's a farm across the street selling weed also... And the owner is actually 10 par-cent Irish! What I'm upset about is a wee little thing called "cultural appropriation". Ever heard of it? That's why we can't wear sombreros on Cinco de Mayo. Why we can't dress like Indians on Halloween. I'm looking at my point, you racist son of a bitch. You have no right to wear that stuff. It is offensive. Come on, guys! St. Patrick's Day is the one day of the year we have left where we can actually celebrate being white. Any other day that we tried to be proud of our culture, we would get immediately cancelled by Twitter! And yet for some reason, you're all over here, buying your weed from someone who is fine mocking our customs and traditions. Okay, yeah... Yeah, let's arrest the white leprechaun. Cuz, you know, can't have one day for a mostly white culture, right? Don't wanna get cancelled. I guess don't arrest him for cultural appropriations? Guess... Guess that only works one way, huh? Yeah yeah, you don't have to push me, copper.  I want my phone call. Yeah, I'm a real fucking leprechaun! Hell yeah we're gonna bust outta here, what do you have planned?  Uh, yes, this is Randy Marsh, I've been incarcerated. I need to speak with my attorney. Yes, I am aware of that. Listen to me carefully. The canary is in the cage. Oh, a confidential matter? Lawyer client privilege. Uh, you know, there's an officer standing right here, actually.  Stan! They got me locked up, you're gonna have to help me break outta here. We have to stop them. Listen to me... is your friend Tolkien there? Yeah, well, his piece a shit dad is trying to take over the St. Patrick's Day Special! You better care, because if we don't make money today you and sister are gonna starve. Do you understand? And I won't be able to pay the Wi-Fi bill. I need you to leave school, go home, and get a jar of the St. Patrick's Day Special weed and sneak it into the police station. I'm asking you to do one little thing. Ditch school, get weed, sneak into the police station. Do it or no more Wi-Fi, I mean it!  Wha... Wha... What's happening?! What's happening? I told you to bring me weed, not a cake! You don't fucking listen to me, do you?! You're incapable of ever doing anything right because--  It's simple... There's always cops looking to make a score. You just gotta find the one willing to trade some drugs for a favor.  Oh... Oh, man, that is strong... White people were slaves in history? Nuh-uh.  Hey, my bruthuh. You got a second? You don't wanna miss out on the only white holiday still allowed, do ya? How'd you like to be able to, uh, celebrate a little? No!  That's it. It's over. My plan is done. Me golden coins of spite!  Towelie... where is all the St. Patrick's Day Special? The weed's all gone, does that mean you were able to sell it? What?! So you mean that right now everyone down at the Irish bar is enjoying my special and they don't even know it?! Come on, let's go!  Stop right there, you piece a shit!  Is everyone enjoying the special?! Oh, yes, so did a lot of people. But you see there's just one thing wrong.  You see?! This is what happens when you appropriate a culture! It's sort of your special and it's sort of not your special... And nobody knows whose special it is. No! No no no no no! You don't get to say what you learned 'cause it's not your special! This holiday is about Tegridy. Whoa-a-a!  Aw... Aww!
