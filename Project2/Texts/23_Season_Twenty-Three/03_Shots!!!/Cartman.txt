No shots! No shots!   No! No! No! Noooooo! Oh, that's a good idea. Like, maybe, exclusive use of the tetherball court at recess for the next two months? Sweet.  I won't change my mind.  We're going home? You promise? Wait, can I get a toy from the toy chest? Cool!   Hey guys! I'm back in school! I'm allowed back, and it's all good. No. I don't have to get my shots, ever!  And they can't do anything about it, because I'm a "consciousness objector." Yeah I told the school, I said "Look, you guys, I happen to have 'religious, moral, or philosophical convictions'." And so- and I said "I believe that 'health and disease should not be controlled by vaccination'." Those are my beliefs! And besides, I don't want to risk immunizations making me artistic.   I'm sorry. What were you saying? Oh! Snot web. I'll be right back, you guys.  Can somebody get me a paper towel? I got a snot web here. [leaves the cafeteria] Consciousness objector coming through!  No, no. Nooooo! [jumps off the bed] You read me a bedtime story. You tucked me in. And then you let half the town into my room to try and give me a shot against my will.  So you go along with society and and try to force immunizations on me, even knowing the health risks! What if immunizations made my friend Timmy the way he is?! What if they made Jimmy the way he is?! What if they made Tolkien the way he is? That isn't gonna work this time, Mom! I don't want to be around you anymore!  You should have thought of that before you made this house a nightmare for me. Goodbye, Mother!  Weeaak! No, no!  Ah, AAAH!   I've gotta get out of here! Mom!   What??  Okay, doctor. I'm ready for my shot. Bad news? What are you talking about? Mom?  Noooooooo... Noooooooo...
