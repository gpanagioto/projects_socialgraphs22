During the ''G.L.A.'' mini-series, the team took on [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] who was trying to destroy the universe. During the battle, Mr. Immortal is killed leaving Dinah Soar to calm him down while the others continued to fight. After Mr. Immortal is revived, Dinah is killed by Maelstrom with an energy blast. Her death plunged Mr. Immortal into a deep depression. He later recovered after defeating and capturing Deathurge, who had been taking the souls of his loved ones.

==Powers and abilities==
Dinah Soar had natural wings and, with extensive training, she was an agile flyer. She could use the razor tips of her wings as efficient weapons.

She once said that her race does not appear to age.<ref>''GLA: Misassembled'' #1</ref>
