How are we supposed to explain this to our children?! Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial! KYLE, YOU'D BETTER STOP BEING ANTI-SEMITIC RIGHT NOW, MISTER!!  Oh, that does it!  Who the hell do you think you are?! What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?! Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!! What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why? A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of...

Come on, Kyle, we should get going! Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins? Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins? Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water. Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer! What? Why?? Oh my God!   Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle! Stop the game!  So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?
