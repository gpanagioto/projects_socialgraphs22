Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia. No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket. Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life. Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...  Please. Please let him go. Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Tolkien? He's not just staying at their houses? Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!  Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here. I'll call you back.  What? Are you sure?  "Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life.

Even the fish here are radioactive!  and let us get out of here! Cartman, knock it off! They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
