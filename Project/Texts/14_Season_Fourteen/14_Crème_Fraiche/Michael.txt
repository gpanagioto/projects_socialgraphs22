Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at? Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out.  Small white ones, yes ma'am.  Standard or voice assist model? I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.
