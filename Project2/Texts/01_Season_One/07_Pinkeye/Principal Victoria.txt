God bless it! what do you think you're doing?! Where did you get that costume, young man?! Shhh! Oh, God bless America. You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video. Watch the video Eric. Now, do you have any questions? You must remove that costume, immediately! Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now. Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume? Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man.
