Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream? I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.  And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here. Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
