Well, your little brother does it too, Kyle. You didn't know? The Kindergartners are like the biggest vapers at this school.   Butters! I had to! Butters, next time when Kyle walks up to you and says "Are you selling vape stuff," you say "No, I am not, Kyle." Butters. we have to be extra-cautious right now, or else we're -- hang on, hang on --   We can't start getting sloppy now. Do you understand? Everything will make sense, Butters. I told you.  Oh, hey Kyle. What are you up to?  Okay, cool, but come check this out. This is really cool. Just come- no, just come see.  This is really cool.  You know, Kyle, people all need a way to relax. And there's no proof that vaping is that bad for you. Kindergartners need a break too, Kyle! Would you rather the kindergartners smoke cigarettes?  Just please listen, all right? The truth is... we want out. Butters and I thought we could just make some easy money, but you gotta pay off the 6th graders, then you gotta pay off the recess monitor to look the other way. We're in deep, Kyle. Just let us see enough to get out of debt, and we will stop. I swear it. Come on, Kyle, we all make mistakes. Did you already forget last week? You know... Ronan Farrow was here asking about you. Yes, Kyle! He was right over there! Just please,  give us two days to make back the money we need to get out from under this. and we will stop. You have my word. Okay, I'll focus my marketing on another direction. Thank you, Kyle.   Man, am I feeling tired! All this hard work at school?   Hey guys! It's the Vaping Man! What are you doing here, Vaping Man? Vaping? Hey, that's bad for you. Vaping's only for cool kids. Sure, Kyle. What is this about? Well of course.  How is this pushing it on little kids, Kyle? It's marketing! Kyle, we have to make the money to pay off our dealer. How else are we supposed to do it? Why?  That's him. That's my guy.  Whoa, hey dude! Why is there a dead hooker next to you? Dude, that is a dead hooker. What are you doing with it?! I'm calling the cops!   There's a dead hooker at the vape store! Get the vaporizers, and the cash! Get the cash, Kyle! Just get the- Oh shit! Ronan Farrow! Get the stuff and the cash! Ronan Farrow, Kyle! We've gotta get out of here!   Oh, hi Kyle. We were just talking to the counselor about some college opportunities. What are you doing here? Okay, well, we really should talk first, Kyle. Kyle, things have changed. You need to listen. Kyle, listen! You want to hear this! You need to hear this! We'lll be right back, Mr. Mackey.  Kyle, listen. It's bad. The guy we tried to frame at the vape shop. He was the one the sixth graders got their shit from. The sixth graders are pissed at us, Kyle! We have to break into the vape shop and steal enough stuff to make the sixth graders happy. Yeah, but the sixth graders know you were there! Aah! Kyle, what are you doing? Kyle? Nononononono. Okay, Kyle, I'm calling Ronan Farrow.  Hello, Ronan? Eric Cartman. Yeah, hey. So you know Kyle? Yeah, well, you're right about him.
