Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time. Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it. Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him. Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time. We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan. One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little. Yeah, experiment. Hell, we should get in. I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo! Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh? I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things. Good idea. Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me. Huh? Oh, you mean, this? Yeah. That, that was me. Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot. O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.  With two girls or two guys? You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have. ''No'', I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they? Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it? ...Well it is a night for experimenting. Okay, I'll start.   ...Yeah. No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right? Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing.  Um... Yeah yeah sure sure.  Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay? Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself. Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.  Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.  I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub. I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody ''could'' know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.  Well, of course we wouldn't.  Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?  What?! Why the hell would you do that?!  AAAW!!   Who?! Who who did you hear is, is gay?! Oh.   What the hell is that supposed to mean?! Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now? There's nothing to talk about. No, I-... I don't know. No! Will you stop it?! I don't... I just... Aaww!  Sharon, cuh can we go?  Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now. Ogh, I already did. Not now, Stanley.  Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?   God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows. What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-! It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is! You mean it? I'm not gay? Oh, I feel so much better! Wow! Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
