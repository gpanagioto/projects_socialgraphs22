Mr. Garrison! Ohoh, Jezuth! That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison! Ooooo... Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months. No!  Mr. Garrison, there's something you should know. Al and I are getting married.  Oh, Jesus Christ. We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday. Okay, that's enough. Out, Mr. Garrison. Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous. We wanna be treated equally!  Oh, Jesus Christ.
