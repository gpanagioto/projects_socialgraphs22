'''Ahri'ahn''' (more commonly referred to as '''Arion''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[sword and sorcery]] superhero published by American company [[DC Comics]]. He debuted in ''[[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]]'' (vol. 1) #55 (March [[1982 in comics|1982]]), and was created by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and [[Jan Duursema]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | contribution = Arion, Lord of Atlantis | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 24 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref> A powerful, immortal wizard from ancient Atlantis centuries before it sunk, the character originally starred in his own series taking place outside the main continuity of [[DC Comics]]. After the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the character's history was adopted into the [[Atlantis (Aquaman)|Aquaman version of Atlantis]], revised to be a [[demigod]] serving as a member of the fictional group of cosmic entities known as the [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lords of Order]]. The character's magical and scientific exploits and heroism in the fictional mythology of Atlantis makes him both a reverred figure and the cultural progenitor of the [[homo magi]] race and their descendants, the atlanteans. Depending on continuities, he also serves as an ancestor to various characters in the DC Universe, including [[Zatanna]], [[Aquaman]], and [[Ocean Master]].

While mentioned in other media, Arion would make his first animated appearances in the third season of the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series. While sharing similarities to his comic incarnation, he is instead cast with both a different parentage and is the biological progenitor of the homo magi and atlantean race.

==Publication history==
=== Creation and early appearances ===
Prior to the creation of the Arion character and his debut in his backup series, Kupperburg began coming up with new ideas that lead to his backup series when his then-editor, Laurie Sutton, mentioned that ''Dragonsword'' (the current backup of ''Warlord'' then) was eventually going to end. Sutton also mentioned the only requirement of the series was that it be set in the sword-and-sorcery genre. Kupperburg suggested a story of a young mage while Sutton requested it to take place in the fabled location of Atlantis. During the creation of the series, the name of the main character was noted to be a difficult process but eventually, "Arion" was settled with the names "Tynan", "Atlan", and "Orin" as contenders.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Review of Arion, Lord Of Atlantis ongoing series|url=http://www.dcinthe80s.com/2016/02/review-of-arion-lord-of-atlantis.html|access-date=2021-12-22|language=en}}</ref> Although the names weren't used for the main character, the names appeared in both ''Arion, Lord of Atlantis'' and later ''Aquaman'' titles.

Arion began as a back-up feature in the DC Comics book ''[[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]]'' with issue #55,<ref name="Guide">{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=18}}</ref> in which ran until issue #62 before Arion gained his own series, ''Arion Lord of Atlantis'', beginning with #1 (November [[1982 in comics|1982]]). The series lasted for 35 issues plus a special which wrapped up the original storyline, running from November [[1982 in comics|1982]] to September [[1985 in comics|1985]] with the special shipping in November [[1985 in comics|1985]]. Concurrently between April 1985 - March 1986, Arion was one of the many characters involved in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover title, with his history of Atlantis inserted into the main DC continuity. Arion also appeared in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' in a crossover with [[Superman]].<ref>''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #75 (November 1984)</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Greenberger|first1=Robert|title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia|last2=Pasko|first2=Martin|date=2010|publisher=Del Rey|isbn=978-0-345-50108-0|page=15}}</ref>

Years later in 1991, Kupperburg sent in a proposal for what would eventually be ''Arion the IMMORTAL'', a sequel to his original series. Originally titled ''Arion: Darkworld'' and ''Arion, Lord of Order'', due to elements similar to characters presented in ''Doctor Fate'' and the ''[[Sandman (DC Comics)|Sandman]]'' titles, the draft was reworked as to make the characters involved in the book independent of the same [[Lords of Chaos and Order]] concept of magic different from the framework established in two DC Comic titles as to not interfere with their direction and depiction.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-22|title=Arion the Immortal, The Proposal {{!}} Paul Kupperberg|url=https://kupps.malibulist.com/2019/06/22/arion-the-immortal-the-proposal/|access-date=2021-12-22|website=Paul Kupperberg {{!}} And Then I Wrote...}}</ref> In 1992, Arion would star in his miniseries which ended after the sixth issue, establishing him in the modern era. He would also make appearances in several ''Aquaman'', ''Wonder Woman'', and ''Justice League'' crossovers.

=== Modern stories ===
During the early 2000s, despite the efforts to ensure the characters and concepts in the series were dissimilar to both titles, many references books and encyclopedias later connected Arion's character, supporting cast, and villains to the same Lords of Chaos and Order characters referenced in other titles.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936192301 |title=The DC comics encyclopedia: the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe |publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK Publishing]] |others=Alan Cowsill, Alexander Irvine, Steven Korté, Matthew K.

Despite the character's death, a past version of the character hailing from the 1600s would appear in 2006 in the "Camelot Falls" storyline in the ''Superman'' title and is depicted as an antagonist to the story. Concurrently, a new incarnation of Arion appeared whose real name was William Knightly.

==== New 52 & Rebirth-onward ====
Eventually, a new version of the character was introduced in the ''Secret Six'' 2014 run by Gail Simone; while making a shilloutte appearance, the character's children, Uvian and his unnamed sons, formed a cult known as the Children of Arion and appeared in one of the main antagonists in the Gauntlet storyline in the series.<ref name=":1" /> The character would eventually make a full appearance in the ''Blue Beetle'' series, acting as the main antagonist while the book itself connected the Blue Beetle's [[myth]]os with other magical characters and concepts such as Arion himself, Doctor Fate, and changing Khaji Da's origins to suggest it is magically powered form of technology.<ref name="Blue Beetle" />

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
====Origin====
In Arion's original origin told to him by Calculha, Arion was a cosmic born from energies coalesced into form. Because of his standing as a cosmic being, he is capable of affecting the balance between both order and chaos and because of that, is chosen as an unwitting agent. He is found by his aged mentor, Calculha, who is considered the most powerful sorcerer of his time and is tutored in the art of magic and spell-casting. Through their training, they form a bond similar to that of father and son.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kupperberg|first=Paul|title=Warlord #58|publisher=DC Comics|year=1982}}</ref>

In his revised origin story, much of the elements of his original backstory changed: Arion (referred to then as "Ahri'ahn") is one of the two biological sons of Calculha (who was formerly featured simply as his father-figure and mentor in the earlier issues of Warlord) and Dark Majistra (a sorceress with an appearance implying her to be an ancestor of those who would eventually become the [[Egyptians]]), as well as the [[fraternal twin]] of Garn Daanuth. Ahri'ahn was prophesied to be a savior of Atlantis. Shortly after their birth, Calculha and Majistra separated, leaving the two unaware of their true relation to one another for thousands of years. As they grew up, their parents became political rivals as they were representatives of a cabal of sorcerers from various mythological locations. While Ahri'ahn was taught [[white magic]] by their father, Garn was taught [[black magic]] by their mother. The two brothers eventually meet for the first time and bore witness to their parent's differing vision for Atlantis through the use of powerful mystical artifacts known as the Zodiac Crystals, crystals shaped like the [[Zodiac]] signs that controlled the magical flow of Earth. While Calculha called upon the cabal to keep them separate and senses the impending interference, Majistra sought to combine all crystals in an attempt to create a new era of mystical [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] despite the risks. Despite being outvoted, Majistra would instead use the crystals to further her own power, proving to be the very interference Calculha sensed. Ahri'ahn sacrificed his life to prevent his mother from attaining power but at a cost: both his father and mother would become trapped in an extradimensional realm known as "Darkworld", Garn's skin was drained of color and gave him the appearance of an albino, Arion's body was converted into energy and sent into a star while his soul was sent into Darkworld as well, and the family feud caused Earth's first [[Ice age|Ice Age]]. Eventually, Calculha used his newfound might he gained in over the course of 100,000 years in his imprisonment and resurrected his son with the aid of Wyynde into his second incarnation, which was christened "Arion" by Wyynde, a [[Language change|corruption]] of his actual name. He is taken to Atlantis and is made Lord High Mage for the King of Atlantis, D'Tilluh. Eventually, he is re-taught magic he had forgotten by Calculha and becomes one of Atlantis's foremost protectors, aided by his companions Wyynde, Atlantean lieutenant guardsman, and Lady Chian, Captain of D'Tilluh's royal guard and lover.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kupperberg|first=Paul|title=Arion, Lord of Atlantis #4|publisher=DC Comics|year=1982}}</ref>

Later additions to his origin expand on the time in which his soul existed in a state of intangibility in Darkworld as he was raised by sorceress Jheryl and befriended the [[Imp]], Ghy. Also teaching him magic, she created the very red gemstone he bore with him after his resurrection as Arion and served as his motherly figure in place of Majistra. When called back to the land of the living by his father, the sudden departure from one realm to another blocked his memory of his time in the Darkworld. Owing to its unique regard to time, only twenty years passed in the realm while 100,000 years passed on Earth.<ref>''Arion'' #33, 1985</ref>

==== ''Arion, Lord of Atlantis'' (1982-1985) ====
Throughout his life as Lord High Mage, Arion would have many adventures; he would encounter and be pitted against various gods of the Atlantean pantheon, ended the Ice Age at the cost of his own magical power, and sought ways to reclaim his former might. He would also encounter Garn and learn of their true connections as well as gain a new ally: Mara. Eventually, Arion defeated Garn once and for all by sealing him away in Darkworld. Arion would also reclaim his magical power when he was lured into Darkworld by his mother in a plot to gain more power through a connection to Darkworld like its respective denizens. With his soul re-worked by the deity known only as the Weaver, Arion gains his former might but is unable to stop the destruction of Atlantis when Chaon, one of the Atlantean dark gods, led an alien race (later revealed to be descendants of Atlanteans that ventured into space) against Atlantis and sunk it himself. With the empire fractured, the remaining Atlanteans venture to other corners of the globe to rebuild.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Kupperburg|first=Paul|title=Arion, Lord of Atlantis (1982-1985) #1-35, Special #1|publisher=DC Comics|year=1982–1985}}</ref>

==== ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' ====

{{see also|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}
Arion would appear in the ''Crisis on Infinite Earth'' crossover as being among the heroes taken in by Habringer and aids the heroes.

=== Post-Crisis ===
Owing to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Arion's universe now exists in the same DC Multiverse with a few changes; Arion's version of Atlantis took place in the distant past, roughly around 500,000 years before the main DCU timeline and is explained that despite Arion's belief, Atlantis as a whole wasn't destroyed.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=David|first1=Peter|title=Aquaman: The Atlantis Chronicles|last2=Greenberger|first2=Robert|publisher=DC Comics|year=2017}}</ref> He was also made part of Powergirl's backstory, being his great-granddaughter jettisoned into the future, her powers said to originate from Arion's experimentation in genetic manipulation<ref>''[[Secret Origins]]'' #11 (February 1987)</ref> and an ancestor of [[Zatanna|Zatanna Zatara]] through her mother's side.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Marrs|first=Lee|title=Zatanna: Come Together #4|publisher=DC Comics|year=1993}}</ref> Eventually, Arion and characters within his series would be connected to DC's ''[[homo magi]]'' and the [[Lords of Chaos and Order]], the aforementioned sorcerer being among the Lords of Order. Affiliated characters, like his father and mother, would also be retconned into being deities themselves, making him an actual being of divine origin.<ref name="dc-ency" />

Later, an aged Arion is revealed to be immortal and to have lost his magic and is living in [[Greenwich Village]] along with several former Atlantean gods and goddesses, including '''Chaon''', '''Deedra''', '''Gemimn''', and the '''Weaver'''. His companion, Mara, was trapped in canine form when the magic was lost.<ref>''Arion the Immortal'' #1-2, 1992</ref>  Arion renews his old rivalry with his brother, Garn Daanuth, and works to stop the return of Atlantean magic by preventing Darkworld, revealed to be a sentient being, from slumbering.<ref>''Arion the Immortal'' #3-6, 1992</ref>

In the ''Time Masters'' mini-series Rip Hunter and allies travel back in time to Atlantis where Arion assists them while trying to convince Hunter to not use violence.

After ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', Arion aided The [[Justice League|Justice League America]] against Scarabus.<ref>''[[Justice League America]]'' #93-94</ref> He eventually turned up in the present day where his body was taken over by [[Mordru]] and his spirit imprisoned in [[Gemworld]]. His spirit was finally released and allowed to go to the afterlife by Power Girl and Hawkgirl (along with a recently awakened [[Hawk and Dove|Dove]]), in order to weaken Mordru. Before his soul departed, Arion revealed to Power Girl that she was not his granddaughter and thus not an Atlantean.

Arion seemingly reappeared in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as one of the mystics gathered in Atlantis to keep [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]] at bay, and later in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' tie-in special as one of several magical beings summoned to help rebuild the shattered Rock of Eternity. No explanation was given for Arion's involvement at the time. It was later revealed that this Arion was, in fact, a pretender, a native of Akron named Bill Knightley who had decided to trade on Arion's name and reputation to build himself up in the mystical community.<ref>''Superman'' #663</ref>

====Camelot Falls====
A past version of Arion later appears. In the year 1659, Arion is awakened from a night of debauchery by visions of a cataclysmic future centered around the presence of Superman. Cut off from his natural magics, Arion employed certain artifacts to propel himself forward to Superman's present. Arriving in Metropolis, Arion subjected Superman and his friends at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' to a vision of a possible future where Superman and other alien heroes' involvement in humanity caused people to become dependent on them, ultimately producing an apocalypse as their alien intervention held back the 'natural cycle' of civilizations falling upon reaching their peak, culminating in a mass apocalypse as the darkness they had held back for so long came at them with full force. Arion hoped to force Superman to retire and prevent the predictions from coming true.

Superman was given two weeks in which to decide how he would deal with Arion's request, during which Arion illustrated his point by magically steering a "field trip" of adolescent [[New Gods]], chaperoned by [[Lightray (DC Comics)|Lightray]] and Fastbak, to come crashing into Metropolis and go wild with their divine powers, causing untold havoc and general interference with the populace. Superman defused the situation with Lightray's help and deduced Arion's involvement. At roughly the same time, Arion kidnapped Bill Knightley from outside the [[Oblivion Bar]], interrogated him, and nearly killed him. The only thing that saved Knightley was his knowledge of the recently begun "Tenth Age of Magic", a tumultuous change in the world's mystical equilibrium. Knightley claimed to be studying the shift and Arion decided he might have some value alive.<ref>[http://www.dcdatabaseproject.com/wiki/index.php/Arion Ahri'ahn (New Earth) - DC Database]</ref>

At the end of the two weeks, Arion and Superman met again; Superman chose to remain active as part of Earth's defense and deeply involved with humanity, refusing to give up hope that he could make a difference. Arion's vicious response was to cast a powerful mind manipulation spell, with the intent of using Superman as a weapon to remove the threat of other alien heroes. Superman was able to resist thanks to training from the [[Martian Manhunter]] after his period under the control of [[Maxwell Lord]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> Given a mystic shield by the [[Phantom Stranger]] to protect him from direct assault by Arion's magics (during which the Stranger revealed that, while Arion's prediction ''could'' come to pass, the loss of life and experience that would result if Superman simply allowed civilization to fall meant that mankind had to try to find another way), Superman was able to defeat Arion and disarm him of his rings, amulets, and charms from which he derived his magic. Arion was returned to 1659 where he plans his next move on Superman in the future.

===The New 52===
====''Secret Six'' Vol. 2: The Gauntlet (2014-2016)====
Although he did not make a full appearance, Arion would make a brief cameo and was mentioned in the 2014 ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' relaunch; it is revealed that millions of years ago, he was the wizard responsible for sealing away elder gods known as the "Dark Giants", who appear to be both based on and a reference to [[Cthulhu Mythos deities]] and are the central antagonists that threaten the world in the modern-day from being released due to [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]]'s condition of siphoning magic around the world, undoing the very seals that kept them in place. His children are also the antagonist as they work to help undo the seal, having formed a cult named the "Children of Arion". The four members remain nameless save seemingly the leader, Uvian.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Simone|first=Gail|title=Secret Six (2014-2016) Vol. 2: The Gauntlet|publisher=DC Comics|year=2017}}</ref>

=== DC Rebirth ===
Following the company-wide rebranding in [[DC Rebirth]], Arion made his new debut in the 2016 ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' series. In this continuity, he shares similarities to his previous version such as being a former king of Atlantis and is stated to be a Lord of Order manifested in the physical form of an Atlantean demigod. He is also indirectly mentioned alongside his brother by the newer version of Calculha and Dark Majistra, this revised history making him an ancestor of [[Aquaman]], [[Ocean Master]], [[Atlan (DC Comics)|Dead King Atlan]], and [[Atlanna]].

==== ''Blue Beetle'' Vol. 2: Hard Choices (2016) ====
Thousands of years ago, Arion was believed to have been turned into an insane villain from exposure to the Blue Beetle scarab and gains a more demonic appearance from the usage of more malevolent magic. After being sealed away by [[Doctor Fate]] long ago, he uses his apprentice Mordecai Cull to lure Doctor Fate. Jaime Reyes, and the Blue Beetle scarab into undoing his sealing, stealing the scarab for himself to use its power to destroy the world. With the help of Doctor Fate and his allies, Jaime Reyes manages to defeat the sorcerer and his Atlantean demons created by his magic. Arion is then sealed in a crystal of absolution by Doctor Fate for 10,000 years.<ref name="Blue Beetle" />

=== DC Universe (2017 - ) ===

==== Justice League/Aquaman: Drowned Earth ====
In the ''Drowned Earth'' Justice League and Aquaman crossover, Arion appears in a series of flashbacks, where it is revealed that both Atlantis and Themyscira were once close allies during his rulership and is responsible for the prosperous and peaceful expansion of the Atlantean Empire. Much of his expolits in his lifetime included building an ancient spaceship for space exploration and attempting to use his technology and magic to make contact with alien lifeforms. He is also revealed to have been Poseidon's protege who revealed a secret of why Earth was different from other planets of life: through the Life Force, a cosmic force that allows life to flourish. Upon learning this secret, Arion took a portion of the Life Force and imbued it into one of his artifacts, dubbing it the "Clarion" and wanted to share a portion of its power. Upon using it, he made contact with divine contemporaries of Poseidon in  alien worlds, including the Triumvirate of Sea Gods, who sought out cosmic force to help their struggling worlds. Combined with Posiedon's jealousy of his student's genius intelligence and selfishly wanting to possess the Life Force for himself, he lies to Arion and claims the trio of sea gods intend to invade Earth. Broken over his supposed naievte, Arion uses his magical powers and technology to create an inversion of the Life Force, instead creating the "Tear of Extinction", liquid in which carries the "Death Force", capable of killing divine entities and sending them to an afterlife known as the Graveyeard of the Gods. Creating the Tear of Extinction caused Arion to subcumb to its negative influence. He used to kill the Triumvirate of Sea Gods but lost his sanity in the process and is said to have perished, his remains buried in his tomb. His death and experience with extaterresial life was told in a legend as a precautionary tale against exploration beyond Atlantis, fueling Atlantean isolationsist policies despite Arion's lifetime fighting against it.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Snyder |first=Scott |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1158913809 |title=Justice League, Aquaman : drowned earth.

In the aftermath of the events, the Triumvirate of Sea Gods would suffer in the Graveyard of the Gods afterlife, bearing a grudge against Arion and Poseidon and would attempt to extract their revenge thousands of years later. Poseidon would feel guilty for being the prime reason he fueled Atlantis's isolationist policies and his betrayal of his apprentice. Eventually,  Arion's ancestor, Arion, would reveal the truth to the trio of sea gods and offer them the same power. Queen Mera, the ruling monarch of Atlantis, would also fulfill Arion's intents by using the Clarion to broadcast her intentions of connecting her kingdom with interested, oceanic alien worlds.<ref name=":2" />

Unlike the Hard Choices storyline in Blue Beetle, the Drowned Earth crossover suggested Arion was insane through the Tear of Extinction<ref name=":2" /> instead of Khaji-Da.<ref name="Blue Beetle" /> The 2021 edition of the ''DC Comics Encyclopedia'' addresses the discrepancy, stating that he was indeed driven insane although instead of dying as the story suggested, he disappeared for a millennia and his fall from grace due to the Tear of Extinction was covered up by Atlantean authorities by claiming he perished. The entry also expresses the chronological events that happened afterward, including the flashback and present accounts of the character in the ''Hard Choices'' storyline as well as suggesting the ''Camelot Falls'' storyline also took place.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1253363543 |title=The DC comics encyclopedia : the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe |date=2021 |others=Matthew K.

|Wyynde
|'''''Warlord'' #56''' (April 1982)
|A lieutenant of the Atlantean Royal Guard and a reluctant prince of the people of Khe-Wannantu (who resembled depictions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]) and one of Arion's closest confidantes, subordinates, and friends. After being cured of his blindness upon acting on Calculha's behalf to resurrect Arion into his second life, Wyynde was fiercely loyal and helped Arion in many adventures while the latter helped him in return. Wyynde's people were eventually eradicated, save his wife, Fawndancer, and his brother, Nightfire, at the hands of Garn Daanuth. After Atlantis's destruction, Wyynde would lose contact with his friends while surveying new lands to rebuild Atlantis. It is implied he eventually landed in North America.
|-

|Chian is a former mercenary-turned Captain of the Atlantan Royal Guard and Arion's chief love interest prior to the destruction of Atlantis.

Loyal to D'Tilluh and Arion, she would serve as another of Arion's closest confidantes, friends, and eventually served as his wife and queen. An expert in sword fighting and weaponry, she along with Wyynde, was considered ancient Atlantis's greatest mortal warrior and trained her eventual husband into a formidable swordsman.
|-
|Mara
|'''''Arion Lord of Atlantis'' #2''' (December 1982)
|A young adventurer from the Thamuz, one of the major city-states conquered by Garn Daanuth during his campaign against Atlantis's rulers in a bid for total rulership, she became intertwined with Arion and his friends when she possessed one of the Zodiac Crystals, an heirloom in her family sought after by Garn. She was later revealed to have shape-shifting powers, only able to use them in dire situations. During her adventures with Arion and friends, she was depicted as having fallen in love with Wyynde despite his constant rejection of her advances on account of her being slightly below marrying age. Her relationship with Arion is strained for a time when Garn's mind-control plot and trauma from the destruction of Khe-Wannantu takes a mental toll on Wyynde to the point of unresponsiveness, blaming Arion's relationship with Garn as being the cause of this.
After the destruction of Atlantis, Mara was originally depicted as having eventually succeeded Arion as queen of the remnant of Atlantis and acting as a close family friend as she helped him look after his grandchildren, Khater and Kara (Powergirl). However, this story was eventually retconned the ''Arion the Immortal'' miniseries reveals that her power to shape-shift was connected to the same font of power that Arion draws his magic from (Darkworld), making her an immortal. It was also revealed that when the Darkworld dimension's connection to Earth ceased, she was in the form of a dog and became trapped in it. Over the centuries, her canine form had forgotten her human life and Arion was unable to magically transform her back. He would keep her canine form as a pet.

Calculha served as an agent of the Lords of Order, Sorcerer Supreme of his time, and was considered the most powerful Master God of the ancient Atlantean pantheon. Depicted as a force of good devoted to protecting Atlantis and the universe, he struggles with accepting Arion's fate as an agent (and later Lord) for the Lords of Order, as its foretellings of his supposed future good deeds places him in mortal danger or require a sacrifice. He is killed by Garn and reveals Arion and Garn's true connection moments before passing away. As a spirit, he assisted Arion through magical crystals finite in number. Eventually, Calculha passes into the afterlife upon the last crystal being spent.
Calcula in recent continuities shares a similar history of being a previous king of Atlantis. He is also said to have been a rival god to Majistra and [[Poseidon]], the former whom he would marry. 
|-
|Chaon
|'''''Warlord'' #57''' (May 1982)
|An embodiment of evil serving in a position held coincidentally by [[Darkseid]] in the future, Chaon served as both a Lord of Chaos and the Atlantean Pantheon's god of evil, madness, and chaos. A native of Darkworld like Calculha, he is also the sibling of his cosmic opposite, Gemimn, and their balancer, Tynan. Constantly held in check by Tynan and Calculha, Chaon attempted to destroy the universe but was foiled repeatedly by Arion and his friends. Eventually, when Calculha dies and rivals Garn Daanuth and Dark Majistra are no longer able to act, he seizes an opportunity to cause suffering by ensnaring his siblings, pits Atlantis against ancestors who disappeared while exploring space, and founded a new technologically based colony, and caused the first destruction of Atlantis 
In ''Arion the Immortal'', it is revealed that he along with his siblings and other gods of the Atlantean Pantheon are depowered following Darkworld's connection to Earth ceasing, trapping them in human forms to save their immortality. Retiring from their cosmic duties, Chaon opens up a seedy Deli shop in New York in the modern day. When magic from Darkworld returns to Earth, he instead uses it to further his business and enjoy his retirement. He is characterized as no longer caring for his former cosmic duties, believing human nature makes his actions to cause chaos redundant. Furthermore, while he often clashes with Arion, he also has slowly come to care for him and is a reluctant confidante when Arion reluctantly accepts the mantle of hero from the resurgence of ancient Atlantean magic.

|The mother of both Arion and Garn Daanuth as well as Calculha's wife. The Atlantean Goddess of Strife and Darkness, she is the only Atlantean ancient goddess with no connection with Darkworld, having been stated to be born on Earth. Her connections as ruler of the people of [[Mu (mythical lost continent)|Mu]] (who resemble ancient Egyptians), her appearance, and her children's abilities to natively invoke powers in connection to Egyptian figures (i.e. [[Ra]]) suggested some connection to [[ancient Egyptian deities]]. In the past, she was said to have genuinely loved Calculha and was once his Queen. Both of them would create the Zodiac Crystals. 
Having a falling out and separating from her husband, she would choose to raise Garn in accordance with a prophecy as an agent of the Lords of Chaos while also favoring him for having inherited more of her likeness. Becoming a political rivals of Calculha, both argued for the status quo of magic on Earth, Majistra in favor of ushering in a new age of dark magic using the Zodiac Crystals. Denied her vision, she would confer to use its power for herself instead but is displaced by her son, Arion. Majistra would plot her return to Earth by using Darkworld's power for her own means but is killed by Arion. In her last death act, she releases her essence onto Earth, strengthening all black magic practitioners. 
In more recent continuities, Majistra is similarly depicted as a Queen of Atlantis in the past and husband to Calculha. She is also said to have been a rival to both her husband and Posiedon.
|-
|[[Vandal Savage]]
|'''''Green Lantern'' #10''' (December 1943)
|In the comics, Vandal Savage (real name Vandal Adg of the Blood Tribe) is an immortal caveman who gained his immortal and regeneration abilities after an encounter with a strange meteorite. Although the character himself never appears in the ''Arion Lord of Atlantis'' series, a younger Vandal Savage is mentioned in the ''Time Master'' series as having been one of Garn's allies as the two were in the Brotherhood of the Light, the prelude group to the modern-day [[Illuminati]], and a known criminal responsible for the attempted de-stabilization of the ancient Atlantean government while Arion acted a Lord High Mage. Despite his crimes, Arion's chose to not pursue Vandal Savage in his later years as he adopted a pacifistic mindset. When time traveler Rip Hunter and the Tim Masters seek to stop Vandal Savage, they learn that Arion's choice to not stop Vandal Savage enabled him to act for centuries despite Arion possessing the power to have stopped him.
In the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, Vandal Savage is instead cast as Arion's grandfather (whereas Arion's comic incarnation is far older than Vandal) who sired him in a plot to create a race of human beings able to inhabit the ocean, giving him control over a significant part of Earth. He would inherit Vanda's metahuman DNA and immortal powers but lacked his regeneration abilities. In Arion's lifetime, he would become an agent for the Lords of Order, ruler of Atlantis, and the ancestral progenitor for the Homo magi and Homo mermanus race (modern Atlantean). He would be killed while defending Atlantis from Klarion the Witchboy, who sunk his fabled city. 
|-
|[[Doctor Fate]]
|''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 (May 1940)
|In the comics, Arion and Nabu are contemporaries due to being affiliated with the same group, the Lords of Order. Despite that, Arion would come into conflict with both Nabu and bearers of the Doctor Fate mantle, Kent Nelson and Khalid Nassour. During the times of ancient Egypt, Nabu would happen upon an insane Arion (having been turned due to using the Tear of Extinction) during his battle with Khaji Da, the Blue Beetle Scarab, as he sought it to advert a coming cataclysm. Falsely concluding that the scarab drove him to insanity, he would seal him in a dimension under modern-day El Paso. Arion and his underlying, Mordecai Cull, would battle Doctor Fate (Nabu and Kent Nelson), Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, and OMAC as he sought to eradicate all of reality. He would later be completely revived under the influence of Merlin and is one of the foretold magical users that will cause the fall of the Tower of Fate, putting the mind-controlled Arion at odds with Khalid Nassour. 
While various characters associated with Doctor Fate and Arion appeared in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, they would not physically meet. Nabu and Arion are cast as relatives, the former as Vandal Savage's son, making Arion his nephew. [[Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour)|Khalid Nassour]] and his mother, Jane Nassour (an adaptation of comic Elizabeth Nassour), are also stated to be homo magi, making them direct descendants of Arion.
|-
|[[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)]]
|''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #3 (February [[2006 in comics|2006]])
|While typically depicted as a hero, Arion is considered an enemy of hero Jaime Reyes, also known as Blue Bettle, in his insane state. Having been sealed in a dimension under El Paso by Nabu, Arion's powerful magical aura causes a resurgence of young teeangers awakening their metahuman powers in his hometown and targets Jaime Reyes and his family through the usage of his minion, Mordei Cull, in order to obtain Khaji Da. Teaming up with Ted Kord, Doctor Fate, OMAC, and Teri Magus (time-displaced Flash of the 31st Century), they thwart Arion's ultimate plan of destroying all of reality through his magic and Khaji Da's cosmic energies.
|-
|[[Superman]]
|[[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] ([[cover-date]]d June 1938; published April 18, 1938)
|While typically depicted as a hero, Arion is also considered a reluctant enemy of Superman. Earlier stories included a crossover between the two as Arion is displaced through time by Chaon and arrives in a modern-day setting. Superman would assist the sorcerer in stopping Chaon and returning Arion to the past while withholding the ultimate fate of Atlantis and its people due to the common plight of having their entire way of life and culture destroyed by a cataclysmic event. When time is set correctly, both characters forget about their adventure with one another. 
In the ''Camelot Falls'' storyline, Superman and a mostly depowered Arion from the 1600s come into conflict when the past Arion claims that Superman's heroics and alien heritage interfere with the natural course of human history resulting in civilizations falling, causing dark forces to push back by cause events that result in far more devastating events that will eventually destroy all of humanity itself and urge him to retire. When Superman refuses, Arion uses his magical powers to battle Superman, cause natural disasters from the dark forces already occupying Earth, and attempt to tarnish Superman's reputation by casting Superman in a bad light. Eventually, with Phantom Stranger's help, he manages to beat while reminding Arion that he once served humanity. Arion secretly escapes to his current time, frustrated with the circumstances and reluctantly agreeing with Superman's stance on humanity.

After sacrificing much of his magical power, he confers to utilizing a source of power for his magics and eventually gains a connection to the extradimensional Darkworld, restoring much of his former might; his connection to Darkworld grants him a variant of magic unique to other magic users known as "Atlantean magic".<ref name="Whos Who 1993">{{cite book |title=Who's Who In the DC Universe Update 1993 #2 |date=January 1993 |publisher=DC Comics |chapter=Arion the Immortal}}</ref><ref name="Definitve Directory">{{cite book |title=Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe #1 |date=March 1985 |publisher=DC Comics |chapter=Arion, Lord of Atlantis}}</ref><ref name="DC Comics Encyclopedia">{{cite book |title=DC Comics Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded |date=2008 |publisher=DC Comics |chapter=Arion, Lord of Atlantis}}</ref>

In more recent continuities, elements of his magical powers differ from earlier continuities; Arion is classified as a "archmage",<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wiacek |first=Stephen |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1285709867 |title=The DC book: a vast and vibrant multiverse simply explained |date=2021 |others=Grant Morrison |isbn=978-0-241-56057-0 |location=London |oclc=1285709867}}</ref> magic users of this classification surpasses enchanted objects by being enchanted them due to being a magic being themselves or being a higher being on the plane of existence.<ref>{{Cite book |title=DC Nation #0 Backup: "Magic Masters" |publisher=DC Comics |year=2018}}</ref> He is able to perform both ordinary and magic of a demonic, malevolent nature as well as siphon magical energy from potent sources of magic such as Doctor Fate's Helm of Fate or Blue Beetle's scarab, Khaji Da.<ref name="Blue Beetle">{{cite book|title=Blue Beetle Vol. 2: Hard Choices (Rebirth)|publisher=DC Comics|last=Griffin|first=Keith|date=January 2, 2018}}</ref>

Arion also has a heightened "sixth sense" and the gift of prophecy, allowing himself to sense disturbances in the present and in the future. He is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant and swordsman despite preferring magical solutions and is a skilled [[three-card monte]] dealer.<ref name="Definitve Directory" /><ref name="DC Comics Encyclopedia" /><ref name="Whos Who 1993" />

=== Artifacts and technology ===
==== Arion's Gemstone ====
The red-gemstone is usually placed in the center of his outfit, it was crafted by one of his masters, Jheryl, from a piece of a large mineral from the home dimension of Atlantean deities. It once acted as a source of power for his light-related magic, allowing him to convert sunlight into magical energy. It was also later revealed to allow a user to draw power from Darkworld and possessed magical defenses that disallowed those whose lineage is not from Darkworld to use its power, only able to be bypassed by strong magic users.<ref name=":0" />

==== Calculha's Crystal ====
Originally a large crystal ball housing the soul and power of Calculha, Arion's godly father, the artifact was shattered in an altercation with Garn Daanuth. After Arion sacrificed much of his magic, he would use the shattered crystals as a source of power, limited by the fact that each crystal only housed a portion of its original power and each usage of it spent the crystal, only having a finite number of them and as such, would only use them in emergencies requiring his sorcerous skills. He would eventually cease using the crystals upon regaining his magic.<ref name=":0" />

==== Staff of Arion ====
A short mystical staff with an unassuming appearance containing powerful Atlantean magic, the staff would eventually end up in the hands of Traci 13, in which said staff allowed her to battle Eclipso.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rogers |first=John |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180753129 |title=Blue Beetle: Reach For the Stars |date=2008 |others=J.

==== Citadel of Sorcery ====
A large structure that served as Calculha's former home, Arion would inherit the large sanctum moments before Calculha's physical body ceased function due to an attack by his eldest son, Garn. The sanctum possessed a wealth of mystical knowledge collected by Calculha pertaining to ancient Atlantean lore, history, and magic that predated Arion.<ref name=":0" /> The Citadel also possessed potent magical power, awakening dormant powers in orders, and possessed unspecified magical defenses that would allow it to be preserved for a millennia.

==== Tear of Extinction ====
Considered a fusion of magic and technology, the Tear of Extinction is a water-like substance infused with a fictional cosmic force known as "Death Force", able to kill gods and send them to the Graveyard of Gods realm in the afterlife. Arion would use this artifact in order to defeat the Ocean Lords in his time although the artifact's usage drove him mad. Droplets of the artifact would end up being used by Lex Luthor, Black Manta, Mera, and Cheetah.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Snyder |first=Scott |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1158913809 |title=Justice League, Aquaman: Drowned Earth #1 |date=2019 |others=Dan Abnett, James, IV Tynion, Francis Manapul, Lan Medina, Clayton Henry, Vicente Cifuentes |isbn=978-1-77950-062-5 |location=[United States] |oclc=1158913809}}</ref>

=== William Knightley ===
{{Comics character list header|debut=''Day of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2005)|creators=Bill Willingham  & Justiniano|abilities=Skilled in magic|alias=Arion<br>Bill Knightley of Akron}}

'''William "Bill" Knightley''' is a sorcerous hero from [[Ohio]] whom took the name and inspiration from Ahri'ahn himself, hoping to use his name ("Arion") to help jumpstart his superhero career and had an opportunity in the form of the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' event, being one of the many heroes to help fight off an insane Spectre. Finding it difficult, he would meet his predecessor's past self, who views him as an imitator and fraud trading in on his name, and would punish him for it despite Bill's stating he was considered dead in the present time and plea to be his advisor. Ahri'ahn would later use Bill as a stand-in for him to be arrested by Superman in his place due to having coming into conflict with the hero and world governments, using a long lasting disguise spell and his actual sorcerous abilities to have him masquerade as himself. Despite Ahri'ahn and his insistence on Bill being an imitator, the magical community is unaware and believes William to be Arion himself. Furthermore, the character's ability to replicate his specific brand of magic and mystical spells cast by Zatanna believing him to be Arion suggests a true connection between Bill and Arion.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Busiek |first=Kurt |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/86072915 |title=''Superman: Camelot Falls'' |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |others=Carlos Pacheco, Jesús.

==In other media==
=== Television ===
* Arion makes his first animated appearance in season four of ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]. This version of Arion differs from his comic book incarnation; he is a grandson of [[Vandal Savage]], making him a relative to [[Doctor Fate|Nabu]] and [[Scandal Savage|Cassandra Savage]], and an agent of order responsible for the advance technology of Atlantis. Unlike his comic version, his magical abilities are also centered around his crown. During his lifetime, the Lords of Order sensed chaos brewing on Earth & imbued him with magical powers through a crown, making him an agent. He became responsible for Atlantis's advancement and his bloodline created the [[Homo Magi]] race due to his metahuman gene through his grandfather & his body having been imbued with the magic from his crown. When he learned his grandfather set out to sink Atlantis to further the Homo Magi & Atlantean, he opposed his grandfather and is killed while attempting to protect it as [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] sinks the city. Survivors of his bloodline adapted to the pressures and environment of the ocean, making him the common ancestor not only of DC's magicians but also of modern Atlanteans, the Homo Mermanus. This version is the ancestor to a plethora of other characters including [[Traci Thirteen|Traci 13]] and [[Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour)|Khalid Nassour]]. Arion seems to have returned in the Aquaman arc but it is later revealed he is actually a clone with [[Ocean Master]]'s mind implanted. When he puts on the crown, he's killed by the [[Lords of Order]].

=== Video games ===
* Arion is mentioned in the MMO game, ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. In the DCUO's universe, his history is similar to both his original and post-Flashpoint incarnation, being one of the two sons of Calculha and Majistra alongside his twin brother, Garn Daanuth, who was a renowned wizard and fought his brother over control of the Zodiac Crystals for centuries. His backstory is explained in the "Atlantis: The Silent School" event in a global briefing titled "''The Lost Crystal of Power''".
* While he does not make a physical appearance, [[Doctor Fate]] gear in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' mentions Arion.
