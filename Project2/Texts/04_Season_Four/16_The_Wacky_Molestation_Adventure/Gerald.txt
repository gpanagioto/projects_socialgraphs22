The answer is no, Kyle! A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro. Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it. Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want- Because we're your parents! Hello, honey, how has prison been for you? Eh, neither did we. Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!! I don't have any urges! Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now. Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
