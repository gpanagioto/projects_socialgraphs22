She had her own comic book series, ''Namora'', which ran from August–December 1948.

Her death was established in ''Sub-Mariner'' #50 (June 1972), where her frozen body is shown to Namor, and her death is depicted in flashback in #51 (July 1972).

Over the next 30 years, Namora appeared in a number of flashbacks and alternate reality stories, including ''What If?'' #9 (June 1978), ''The New Warriors Annual'' #1 (1991), ''What If?'' #47 (March 1993), ''The New Warriors'' #44 (February 1994), ''Avengers: Forever'' #4-5 (March–April 1999), and ''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #3-2 (December 2000-January 2001).

==Fictional character biography==
Namora is a character that originated in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=49}}</ref> Her original name was Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, but she was nicknamed "Namora" in honor of her cousin [[Namor]]. Like Namor, she is a hybrid mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the wings on her ankles. When her father was killed by treasure-hunting surface-dwellers, she fully changed her name to Namora, the Atlantean term for "Avenging Daughter", as Namor means "Avenging Son". She was Namor's cousin (though not by blood), and became his companion for a period of several years.

Namora was ultimately shown to have been fatally poisoned by the Lemurian terrorist [[Llyra]].<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #50</ref>  She was survived by her [[cloning|clone]], [[Namorita]], whom she had passed off as her birth daughter because of Atlantian taboos against cloning. ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' revealed that she had been a member of The [[Monster Hunters]] in 1956.

===Amazon-Atlantean War===
In the course of her membership in Cho's group, she shares a genuinely romantic kiss with Hercules.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #111</ref>  Some time later, following the [[Secret Invasion]], Hercules and Amadeus Cho vacation near an Atlantean city, and she and Hercules have a romantic fling.  This is interrupted by an [[Amazons|Amazon]] attack.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #121</ref> Namora aids Hercules in repelling the Amazons and rescuing Cho from their amorous and ultimately fatal attentions.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #124</ref>

===Dark Reign===
The Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of "supervillains", in order to form close ties to Osborn. After some time, the group becomes aware of Norman's [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] to find out that a member of the group is none other than Namora's cousin, [[Namor]]. Upon finding this out, the Agents confront Namor for his involvement in the group. Initially at odds with each other for their recent decisions, Namora and Namor end up kissing and beginning a relationship.<ref name=autogenerated1/> Namora contemplates staying with Namor until it is revealed that it was Atlantean elders that plotted for them to start a relationship and mate a long time ago as human/Atlantean hybrids are so powerful. Namor and Namora decide to part ways as they were unsure how much of their feelings for each other were genuine and how much was due to the secret plotting of the elders.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #7</ref>

===Infinity===
During ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'', Namora's Atlantean School is chosen as one of the institutions set to do battle in the new [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]].

Namora sends a desperate plea for help to [[Hank Pym]], but the kingdom is destroyed before action can be taken.<ref>''Infinity: The Hunt'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Namora possesses [[superhuman]] strength and can fly. She is nearly invulnerable as bullets and other missiles cannot penetrate her extremely tough skin. She can swim at superhuman speeds, breathe underwater, and is immune to the cold and pressures of the depths. She can also see better underwater than a normal human. Namora must periodically immerse herself in water to retain her powers and her health.

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
The second Namora  first appeared in ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]'' #46, and was created by [[Tony Bedard]] and [[Mizuki Sakakibara]], and was associated with the multiversal travelers called the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. She is an alternate-Earth counterpart of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], rather than of Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, the [[Earth-616]] Namora. She is a mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her feet. Unlike the Marvel Universe Namor and Namora, she has the blue skin of most Atlanteans.

In Namora's universe, she became an early ally of [[Charles Xavier]] who convinced her to not attack the surface world. She would later do so, after anti-mutant hysteria led to the imprisonment of most mutants. Namora killed all of her Earth's superheroes, having the most difficulty with the [[Fantastic Four]], and she conquered the world and ruled it for decades, before becoming 'unhinged' in time and forced to join the Exiles, much to her chagrin.  Having a haughty attitude, she acted like she was superior to the other members. Still, she has shown that she did care for them, as evidenced when she thought that [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] had killed [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]]. She lashed out at Hyperion, breaking his neck. However, it was for naught. Hyperion recovered quickly and blasted Namora with his "flash vision", killing her. The Exiles later sent her body back to her home reality ([[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-2189]]) for burial.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
Namora appeared in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] series. In the  story, "Eternity Twilight", Namora rescued Bruce Banner, who suffered temporary amnesia and have fallen for him not before Banner regained his memory involving the [[Hulk]] (a [[Godzilla]]-like beast accidentally summoned by Banner). Afterwards, Banner and Namora went back to the surface and helps Earth's heroes battle not only the Hulk, but also the demon-god [[Dormammu]].

===Marvel Her-oes===
A teenaged version of Namora appears as one of the main protagonists in the all-ages ''Marvel Her-oes'' series, which was written by [[Grace Randolph]]. She attends the same high school as [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]] and [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], and hides her Atlantean heritage by claiming to be an exchange student from Greece under the name of "Namora Aquarius".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.12082.marvel_hotline~colon~_grace_randolph |title=Marvel Hotline: Grace Randolph &#124; Marvel Heroes &#124; Comic News &#124; News |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2010-04-16 |access-date=2010-12-26}}</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
During the ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' storyline, Thing, Invisible Woman, and Dr. Arthur Molekevic fight Doctor Dorcas alongside Namora and a Tiger Shark in Atlantis and defeat him.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #60</ref>
