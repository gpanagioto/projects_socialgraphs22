'''Phantom Rider''' is the name of several [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]], [[American frontier|Old West]] heroic [[gunfighter]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was originally called '''[[Ghost Rider]]''', and was renamed following the introduction of Marvel's motorcycle-riding character of the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|same name]].

The character has made minor appearances across media. He made his live-action debut in the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'', played by [[Sam Elliott]].

==Publication history==
[[Marvel Comics]]' first Ghost Rider look was based on the [[Magazine Enterprises]] character Ghost Rider (Rex Fury), created by writer Ray Krank and artist [[Dick Ayers]] for editor [[Vincent Sullivan]] in ''[[Tim Holt]]'' #11 (1949). The character appeared in horror-themed Western stories through the run of ''Tim Holt'', ''Red Mask'', and ''A-1 Comics'' up until the institution of the [[Comics Code]].<ref name=toonopedia>[http://www.toonopedia.com/ghrider1.htm Ghost Rider (Magazine Enterprises)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6ddLFbngu?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/ghrider1.htm Archived] from the original on December 8, 2015.</ref>

After the trademark to the character's name and motif lapsed, Marvel Comics debuted its own near-identical, horror-free version of the character in ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d February 1967), by plotter and original ''Ghost Rider'' artist Ayers, and writers [[Gary Friedrich]] and [[Roy Thomas]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=270}}</ref> 

In an interview, Ayers recalled how the character was conceived, "Vin would come in and sit down and describe what he wanted in The Ghost Rider. He told me to go see Disney's [[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad|Sleepy Hollow-Ichabod Crane]], The Headless Horseman, and then he told me to play the [[Vaughn Monroe]] record, "[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Ghost Riders in the Sky]]." And then he started talking about what he wanted the guy wearing."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/10ayers.html | title=TwoMorrows Publishing - Alter Ego #10 - Dick Ayers Interview }}</ref>

With the introduction of Marvel's supernatural Ghost Rider in the 1970s, Marvel renamed its Western Ghost Rider&nbsp;— first, to the unfortunate '''Night Rider''' (a term previously used in the [[Southern United States]] to refer to members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]) in a 1974–1975 reprint series, and then to '''Phantom Rider'''. At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.

The Magazine Enterprises library of characters, including its version of Ghost Rider, was reprinted by [[AC Comics]] in the 1980s. While the copyrights have lapsed due to non-renewal, AC renamed the Ghost Rider as the Haunted Horseman, due to Marvel having maintained the Ghost Rider trademark.

==Fictional character biography==

===Carter Slade===
'''Carter Slade''', the first to wear the mask, debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Feb. 1967). He battled evil while dressed in a phosphorescent white costume, complete with a full-face mask, cape, and the requisite white hat. Slade received his outfit and his white horse from '''Flaming Star''', a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[medicine man]].

He was never called the Phantom Rider in these original appearances. In Marvel continuity, it was not until after Slade's death that the name Phantom Rider was given to the character, and reprints now [[retcon|retroactively]] use that name for Slade.

Eventually, the modern era [[Ghost Rider]] [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] found himself transported into the 19th century where he met and teamed up with Carter Slade. Carter was badly wounded and Blaze took him to Flaming Star to be healed and then dealt with Carter's enemies. Carter recovered and Johnny returned to the present.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, #50. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Carter Slade's spirit, however, returned and possessed his descendant '''Hamilton Slade''' to make him a new Phantom Rider and rode out to rescue Johnny Blaze from certain doom.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Jamie Jacobs===
After Slade's death in ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972), his sidekick '''Jamie Jacobs''' became the second Phantom Rider. He was soon killed in action.<ref>''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Lincoln kidnapped the Avenger and fled to a secret location. He then drugs Mockingbird, removing her ability to give or deny consent, and rapes her. Once the effects of the drugs wear off, an enraged Mockingbird fights and defeats him. In the course of the battle he is knocked over a cliff. As he clings to the cliffside, he first pleads with Mockingbird to help him, then attempts to reassert his hypnotic authority and ''orders'' her to help him. Hating him for his violation of her, Mockingbird allows him to fall to his death.<ref>''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' vol. 2, #18-23 (Aug. 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later, Lincoln's [[restless spirit]] possesses his descendant, Hamilton Slade, to seek "vengeance" against Mockingbird.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #1</ref> His spirit returns a second time in order to make Mockingbird return his feelings.<ref>''Mockingbird'' Vol. 1 #6-7.

In present-day continuity, Lincoln Slade's distant descendant '''Hamilton Slade''' was an archaeologist who found the burial site of his legendary ancestor, in issue #56 of the [[supernatural]]-[[motorcyclist]] series ''Ghost Rider''. As he explored the site, he found a large burial urn and from it appeared the ghostly garb of his ancestors '''Carter''' and '''Lincoln Slade'''. Possessed by the spirits of his ancestors, he became the new version of the Phantom Rider, and rode off to rescue '''Johnny Blaze''', the current Ghost Rider, from one of his foes.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #56.

In the 2010 series ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]'', it is revealed that Hamilton Slade had a daughter named '''Jaime Slade'''. While she was examining an urn belonging to the Slade family estate, Lincoln Slade's spirit possessed her, transforming Jaime into the new Phantom Rider. Claiming to be both "the spirit and the heir", the Phantom Rider teamed up with [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] to battle the heroes [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. Jaime's father Hamilton Slade attempted an exorcism which would rid his daughter of the possessing spirit. Hamilton was successful, but was killed by Crossfire as the exorcism had been completed.
