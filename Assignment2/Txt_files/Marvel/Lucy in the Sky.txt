==Fictional character biography==
===The Pride===
Karolina is the daughter of renowned [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] actors Frank and Leslie Dean and is the only older Runaway who didn't witness [[Pride (comics)|their parents]] murder an innocent girl as a sacrifice.  Karolina denies the entire situation primarily, but finally believes the group soon after discovering she is an alien.<ref name="Vol1#1">''Runaways'' #1</ref> The kids decide to go for a massive ransack, and leave home; before leaving for good, they decide to put their parents to justice by collecting certain evidence from their homes. When arriving at the Dean mansion, they find Karolina's parent's last will and testament; Karolina is given a piece of paper with the circular "[[no symbol]]" covering [[Caduceus|the Caduceus]]. Alex convinces her to remove her [[medic alert bracelet]] because it is emblazoned with the symbol. Karolina angrily concedes, thinking that she only wears the bracelet because she's allergic to penicillin, and her skin immediately glows with a fluid, rainbow-like light.<ref name="Vol1#3">''Runaways'' #3</ref> Remembering something they heard from the Pride's sacrifice, the group assumes Karolina is an alien and the bracelet is an anchor to hide her powers; Leslie Dean later confirms these theories for Karolina.<ref name="Vol1#6">''Runaways'' #6</ref> After escaping their parents, Karolina takes the name Lucy in the Sky, a reference to the song "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]".<ref name="Vol1#6"/>

===Personality===
Early in the series, Karolina constantly struggled with her alien heritage, feeling that she is a "freak" amongst the group, the only one who needs to actively hide her true form.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> Another insecurity was of her speculated homosexuality. Her insecurities even prompt Karolina to offer her life to the [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] [[Topher (comics)|Topher]], as Karolina expresses little desire to live.<ref name="Vol1#12">''Runaways'' #12</ref> After her first near-death experience at the hands of [[Alex Wilder]], Karolina overcomes her [[death drive|death wish]] and helps the Runaways escape the rampaging [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]] as the Pride fight their former benefactors.<ref name="Vol1#18">''Runaways'' #17</ref> After the Pride's defeat, Karolina is sent to live with foster parents, but she organizes a secret reunion for the Runaways, after which they run away again, this time to the Pride's old lair beneath the [[La Brea Tar Pits]].<ref name="Vol1#18"/> Karolina is portrayed as having a wide, free spirit, notably when she discovers she can fly. But she is also shown as being quite sensitive, often crying at her pain and misfortune, as well as the pain and misfortune of others.

===As a fugitive===
[[Image:Karolina's lives.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Karolina's twisted dream.]]
In the early issues of ''Runaways'', volume 2, Karolina fights under the command of de facto leader Nico. Karolina expresses more comfort with being an extraterrestrial<ref name="Vol2#1">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #1</ref> and makes strong hints at being a lesbian, especially as she stops to compliment [[Julie Power]] on her beauty during a battle with [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]] over the custody of [[Victor Mancha]]<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #3</ref> and later even agrees to go on a date with her following a joint [[Avengers Academy]]/Runaways mission<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #28</ref> (and would eventually become romantically involved).<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #39</ref> Soon after Victor joins the team, Karolina "comes out" to Nico with an attempted kiss, which Nico rejects outright.<ref name="Vol2#7">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #7</ref> Karolina's "outcast" insecurities resurface when her [[Skrull]] fiancée [[Xavin]] comes to Earth in search for her. Unbeknownst to her, Karolina's parents arranged Xavin's and Karolina's marriage as part of a peace-weaving effort between the Skrull and [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#M|Majesdanian]] (her species) homeworlds.<ref name="Vol2#8">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #8</ref> Karolina leaves with Xavin, much to Nico's distress.<ref name="Vol2#8"/>

While on her home planet Majesdane, Karolina learns to control the shift between her Majesdanian and humanoid forms and how to further control her solar powers.<ref name="Vol2#16">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #16</ref> However, the wedding does not go as planned and the couple flees towards Earth as their homeworlds reignite the old war. They crash land near the Hostel and return in time to assist in the rescue of [[Molly Hayes]].<ref name="Vol2#17">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #17</ref> Karolina has a dream of her parents tearing her apart.

===Deportation and other activities===
In ''S.W.O.R.D.'' #2, Karolina is one of the aliens kidnapped by [[Henry Peter Gyrich|Henry Gyrich]] in his "aliens go home" policy.<ref name="S.W.O.R.D. #2">''S.W.O.R.D.'' #2</ref> He uses pheromones to target Karolina's Majesdanian physiology and leads her away from the Runaways and kidnaps her without difficulty.<ref name="S.W.O.R.D. #2"/> She was eventually freed along with the other aliens. She assists in saving the Earth from a fleet of murder-happy aliens. [[Abigail Brand]], now the sole head of S.W.O.R.D., returns all the aliens to Earth, reassuring them they will have their freedom and they are each owed one favor.<ref>''S.W.O.R.D.'' volume 1: No Time To Breathe (120 pages, July 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-4076-X}}) (2010)</ref> In ''[[Avengers Arena]]'', Karolina and Molly sought out Hank Pym for help when Nico and Chase go missing. Karolina dismissed Molly's concerns that somebody took their friends instead she believed they ran off to be together.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #13</ref> Karolina later appears in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'' where she and Molly visit Nico and Chase in the S.H.I.E.L.D. detention center after [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] allegedly killed Arcade.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #4</ref> Karolina entered a relationship with [[Julie Power]] of [[Power Pack]].

===Reunion===
After the Runaways disbanded for some time, Karolina has moved on to a happy new life in college and left behind her anxieties over her old life with the help of therapy; thus, declined the invitation to reunite even with the return of undead Gert. Karolina reasoned she had grown up and changed from their time as scared kids on the run. She also felt it didn't make sense for them to get back together because they were never a team, like the Avengers, or had a mission, other than staying alive and not becoming their parents. Nico agreed with Karolina's assessment, but it still left her riddled with guilt.<ref name="vol5#3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Colorist = [[Matt Wilson (comics artist)|Matt Wilson]] | Story = Finding Your Way Home | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = #3 | Date = Nov. 8, 2017 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Karolina dropped by Nico's apartment to reconsider the reunion when Nico attempted to kiss Karolina but is rejected due to having a girlfriend and dismissed it as Nico's habit of seeking comfort at times of stress.<ref name="vol5#5">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Colorist = [[Matt Wilson (comics artist)|Matt Wilson]] | Story = Finding Your Way Home | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = #5 | Date = Jan. 10, 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> The Runaways banded together to rescue Gert and Molly from Molly's mad scientist grandmother's house.

== Characterization ==

=== Relationships ===

Karolina gets along well with the other Runaways, and the only time she had ever got into an argument with them was after they questioned her about Xavin's gender.<ref name="Vol2#23">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #23</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cronin |first=Brian |date=2017-02-06 |title=Marvel's Runaways: Get To Know the Teen Team Before Their TV Debut |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-runaways-tv-hulu-whos-who/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> She has an older-sister type relationship with Molly, but a caring relationship with both Chase and Victor, whom she had both comforted after they lost loved ones.<ref>Chase had lost Gert, and Victor had lost Lillie</ref>

==== Nico Minoru ====
It was subtly hinted throughout the first volume of ''Runaways'' that Karolina had harbored a longtime crush on Nico.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Garcia |first=Mayra |date=2022-01-14 |title=10 Best Marvel Comics With Great LGBTQ+ Representation |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-best-lgbtq-representation/ |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Much later, Karolina attempted to kiss Nico, but was rejected. Karolina then came out to Nico as a [[lesbian]], admitting her feelings for Nico.<ref name="Vol2#7" /> After deciding to leave Earth to marry Xavin, Karolina left her medical alert bracelet with Nico as a token of remembrance. When Karolina later returned to Earth, she accidentally confessed to Xavin (who had taken on the form of Nico) that she was still in love with Nico. Despite this, Karolina remained staunch in her devotion to Xavin, and thus her feelings for and attraction to Nico occasionally put a strain on their friendship.<ref name="Vol2#30" />

When the Runaways re-banded some time later, Nico made possible romantic overtures towards Karolina, ultimately attempting to kiss her. However, Karolina rejected Nico out of faithfulness to Julie and dismissed it as Nico's habit of seeking comfort in times of stress.<ref name="vol5#5"/> Following Julie and Karolina's break-up, Karolina invited Nico to attend her parents’ legitimate foundation's a charity ball with her. While there, Karolina's usual nervousness was replaced by newfound confidence because of Nico's support as she's felt Nico had “always seen the real” her.<ref name="vol5#12"/> Nico confessed she was confused about herself for so long she couldn't see her clearly. Nico knows who and what she wants now and asks Karolina for a second chance.<ref name="vol5#12"/> Karolina was surprised and scared, which exacerbated her old feelings of rejection when Nico pulled away.<ref name="KissScript"/> But Nico seized her chance and the two kissed, beginning a relationship.<ref name="vol5#12"/>

==== Xavin ====
Xavin came to Earth to marry Karolina, revealing that their parents had arranged a marriage between the two of them in order to keep Earth safe from Skrull attacks. Karolina initially rejected Xavin; Xavin attempted to persuade her, explaining that the marriage would be part of a peace treaty. Karolina still refused, stating that it would be a "lie" for her to marry a man. Xavin then revealed that Skrulls had the ability to shapeshift into different sexes, prompting Karolina to decide to accept the marriage proposal.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> However, they were later unable to get married when war broke out again between the Skrulls and Majesdanians. They escaped to Earth and re-joined the Runaways.<ref name="v2#17">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian K. Vaughan]] | Penciller =  [[Adrian Alphona]] | Inker = | Story = Parental Guidance | Title = Runaways | Volume = 2 | Issue = #17 | Date = June 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Throughout their relationship, Karolina apparently fully accepted Xavin's continued changing between male and female appearances. However, she secretly expressed confusion and doubts over Xavin's true gender. However, during an argument, Xavin subconsciously reverted to female human form, which pleased Karolina.<ref name="Vol2#30"/> Their relationship ended when Xavin left Earth with a remaining group of Majesdanians, sacrificing themself for Karolina.<ref name="runv3#6">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Terry Moore (cartoonist)|Terry Moore]] | Penciller =  [[Humberto Ramos]] | Inker =  | Story = Dead Wrong | Title = Runaways | Volume = 3 | Issue = #6 | Date = Jan. 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

==== Julie Power ====
Karolina flirted with and later began dating [[Julie Power]], after a trip to Avengers Academy; this resulted in long-term relationship. Julie attempted to convince Karolina to move to New York so they could be together full-time after the past year apart, though Karolina was resistant to this.<ref name="vol5#7" /> After visiting Karolina in Los Angeles, Julie broke up with her, believing that she and Karolina were too incompatible and that Karolina's first priority would always be to the Runaways.<ref name="vol5#8" />

=== Conceptual changes ===
In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Karolina Dean was originally called Leslie. This name would eventually be given to [[Leslie Dean|the character's mother]]. Her parents were originally real estate agents, rather than famous actors.<ref name="hardcover">{{cite book |last=K. Vaughan |first=Brian |url=https://archive.org/details/runawaysvol10000vaug/page/448 |title=Runaways, Vol. 1 HC |author2=Adrian Alphona |date=2005-08-10 |publisher=Marvel |others=Takeshi Miyazawa |isbn=0-7851-1876-4 |series=Runaways |volume=1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/runawaysvol10000vaug/page/448 448] |access-date=2008-11-04}}</ref>
Karolina's Majesdanian form has been colored in two distinct styles.  Brian Reber, the first colorist of ''Runaways'', colored Karolina with many different colors of the [[visible spectrum]] from panel to panel. [[Christina Strain]], the second colorist for ''Runaways'', colors Karolina in lighter tones, using primarily blue, yellow, and pink with a glitter-like effect.<ref>Pages</ref> 

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Majesdanians, Karolina's natural form is luminous, iridescent, and visually fluid, often depicted with waves of rainbow-like light floating off her body (Chase described her as "a burning painting") though body structure is essentially humanoid.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> Originally, Karolina required a custom made [[medic alert bracelet]] constructed of an unspecified alien metal to revert to humanoid form. However, after spending many months on Majesdane, Karolina learned to control the change and can make it at will.<ref name="Vol2#16"/> In her Majesdanian form, Karolina is able to manipulate solar energy absorbed by her body to generate large concussive blasts, fine [[laser]]-like beams and force fields capable of stopping cave-ins, gunfire and explosions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Erao |first=Matthew |date=2017-11-01 |title=Runaways Fans Won't Be 'Disappointed' In Karolina's Powers |url=https://screenrant.com/runaways-tv-show-karolina-powers/ |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kantor |first=Jonathan H. |date=2018-07-05 |title=Goddlers: 20 Children Too Powerful For Their Own Good |url=https://www.cbr.com/superhero-children-too-powerful/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-07-08 |title=18 Queer Female Superheroes and Villains Who Can Kick Your Ass |url=http://www.pride.com/women/2015/7/08/18-queer-female-superheroes-and-villains-who-can-kick-your-ass |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=www.pride.com |language=en}}</ref> Like her parents, Karolina learned the ability to bind people, binding a New Pride in a colorful sphere.

The drawback to Karolina's powers is that they have a finite charge. If she is in her Majesdanian form too long or exerts her powers too much, her glow will start to fade and revert her to human form until she uses the sun's rays to recharge. The only time she entirely lost her powers was when the Runaways battled the Gibborim to prevent Chase from sacrificing himself.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Leslie Dean stated early in the series that Majesdanians' abilities do not affect one another.<ref name="Vol1#18"/>

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Peyton Hinckle of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' referred to Karolina Dean as a "fan favorite," writing, "Her popularity has grown even more, making her one of the most well-known lesbian characters in the comics industry. Readers and viewers alike adore Karolina Dean for her free-spiritedness and diverse background. But I think there’s more to Karolina’s character than just what’s on the surface. Yes, she’s a rare gem in a sea of heterosexual heroes, but she’s also one of the best role models Marvel has (which might not be saying much but you get the point). Like so many real-life queer teens, Karolina struggled to understand her true self: as a superpowered alien and as a lesbian. She also was able to overcome those struggles and find self-acceptance. As readers, viewers, and fans, we can take our own challenges and use Karolina’s model to become the people we want to be."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hinckle |first=Peyton |date=June 17, 2018 |title=Why Karolina Dean is the Lesbian, Rainbow Goddess We All Need in Our Lives |url=https://comicsverse.com/karolina-dean-lesbian-rainbow-goddess/ |website=[[ComicsVerse]]}}</ref> Theo Kogod of ''[[CBR.com]]'' described Karolina as one of Marvel's "well-written and diverse heroes," asserting, "Admittedly, it took a while for the company to take a stand and show meaningful LGBTQ+representation. But over the years, more and more queer heroes have appeared at the forefront of major Marvel comics. Like with the ''Young Avengers, Runaways'' was a series designed to focus on a team of teenaged heroes that included LGBTQ+ characters front and center. The original ''Runaways'' series was written by Brian K. Vaughan and drawn by Adrian Alophona, and its first issue was released in 2003. Vaughan has made his commitment to diversity and allyship core to his writing, and so he included the character Karolina Dean as a lesbian. Sadly, representation was pretty limited in 2003 and this was initially only hinted at. However, Karolina would later enter into a same-sex relationship with her teammate Nico. While modern readers might not think much of this, it was a huge deal at the time."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kogod |first=Theo |date=2021-06-19 |title=10 Great Marvel Comics That Feature Well Written LGBTQ+ Characters |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-feature-well-written-lgbtq-characters/ |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Joshua Yehl of ''[[IGN]]''  said, "Finding out you are an alien and running away from your super villain parents is hard enough, but teenager Karolina Dean also had to deal with her intimate feelings toward fellow teammate Nico. Throughout the first volume of Runaways, Kar was mainly trying to come to grips with how her being an alien made her the outsider of the team, but there were also subtle hints of her attraction to Nico. She even went so far as to act suicidal by offering up her life to a vampire. With time, she eventually overcame her insecurities and came out to Nico by trying to kiss her. Nico rejected Kar, which led to a relapse of insecurity, this time about her homosexuality. The girl can’t catch a break! Kar wouldn’t be the first gay person to develop feelings for a straight friend, and that’s what makes writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona’s depiction of her so authentic. The reader watches her struggle with her feelings, spiral downward into self-destruction, and rise back up by expressing herself only to hit a new low afterward. Coming out is not an easy one-time event, but a long, emotional process that doesn’t always turn out as planned.
