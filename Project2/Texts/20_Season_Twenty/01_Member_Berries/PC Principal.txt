Alright, ladies. First of all I wanna say that I completely respect your decision to protest our national anthem. Thought it was sweet. I believe you shed some light on some very important issues regarding gender equality. Ladies, I understand you're upset about the trolling you've received on the Internet, but there is no evidence that Eric Cartman is Skankhunt42. Well he claims that he's been working at changing himself and the world around him.  Send in Mr. Cartman. Mr. Cartman, I'm gonna ask you one more time, are you or are you not the Internet troll Skankhunt42?
