I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.  Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately. You're darn right, Eric! Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!  What? Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?  We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You ''grew'' 1.2 inches. Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?! We didn't! This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself! Because you have an anger problem, Eric! Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway. Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion. Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
