Ugh, I hate those things. Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: "HEY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!"  I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things! Ohh, rain''bows''. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool. Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it. Nothing..! What? Kick ass! Yeah I do, Pop-Tarts are frosted. Oh, you know, this and that. There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid. Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time? You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous. Hey! That kid is me. Me! Eric Cartman! Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish. Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise. If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos? Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap! I can't. I have to go home and get in shape. Screw you, hippie!

Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up. Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings! Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh. Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely. I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape! No they don't, you jealous weakling! Hey! Oh look, another hippie. Peace, Wendy. Oooh, <poem><i>Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...</i></poem> <poem><i>...K I S S I N G. First comes the baby and...</i></poem> This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake! Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame. You got to get over this whole jealousy thing.
