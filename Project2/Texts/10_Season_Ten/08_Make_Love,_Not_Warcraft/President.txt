Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players.. We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to ''kill'' our admins. And he grows stronger every day. Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.  Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...has absolutely no life. What? Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft. My God...they must have no lives at all. A chance. The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80. Soltzman. He's an accountant. Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.  We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them. Where is he?! Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle! We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail. I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you? Our world is saved!
