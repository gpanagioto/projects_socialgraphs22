Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Hey, here's a post about Tolkien: "Tolkien Black's Private Gym Photos"  Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack. "In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."  It's not somebody in this room. Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me. Huh? It's a rat!  There's no telling. It could be about any of us.  Nothing broke on the Web site yet.
