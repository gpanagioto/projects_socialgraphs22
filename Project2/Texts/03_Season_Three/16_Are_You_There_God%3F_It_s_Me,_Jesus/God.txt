 What is it, my child? Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival. Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me. Be ye careful of pride, Jesus. I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself. Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  What did you expect me to look like, My son? Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.  My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it. You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man â€” with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven.  I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000.
