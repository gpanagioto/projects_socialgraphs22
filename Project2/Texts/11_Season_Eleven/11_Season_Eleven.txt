And now back to Wheel of Fortune! Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage. This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs. Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report. Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC. Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado. This! ...is Dateline. All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round! You've got some family here watching tonight.  And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home? Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is  People Who Annoy You. As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E.  We just need three more consonants, and a vowel. And a vowel? Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here.  Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh. Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.  Thanks, Pat! Yeah, they're all rooting for me.   Yeah.  Hi, everybody watching in South Park! Okay.  Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.  An O please. Uh... Well, uh... I know it but I don't think I should say it. Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Ohhh...  Right.  Well, gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang? Wha?! Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money. I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson.  Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right? Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans. Y-Yes, absolutely. Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you. Huh? You want me to kiss your- Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh... Ooh! An African-American performer at the comedy club.  Yeah... No problem... I just... need some aspirin. Fine!  Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how I try, people just say "Hey! There's that 'ni**er' guy."  And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you!  Awww! Awwww!  Whoa!  Please I, I don't want any trouble.  What do you want? What's going on here? No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money. You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did! No. Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "ni**er guy". Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate. Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a ni**er guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence. Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "ni**er guys"?  We did it! ''[inside] ...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.'' Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good.  Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter! Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them. Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins. That's right. Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs! What is wrong with him?!   Hang on, I'm taking a crap. What? We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys. Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son. Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here. I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions! We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men. Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand. I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected! Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world! I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time. I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father. Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning. You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away. Dammit. Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here! Just get out of here!  Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something. Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us? You... You monster! You have no right to wear that hat! It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge. I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore. No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this! Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit! Just hand over the bunny, Stan!  Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit. No! That is not the way we're remembering it! Oh, we should've seen that coming! No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof. Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter. That's my boy. Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars. You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA. No, sorry, I don't have any change. No, sorry.  Huh! I don't have any change.  No!  Leave me alone I don't have any change! Oh, now I ''feel'' bad.  Nono, that was really all the change I had. I just gave you change! Wahhh! I don't have any more change!   Stay awayhay! Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange! Help! Help us!  No sign of anybody else.  Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people. You won't make it through, Gerald!   He's become one of them. We don't have any change! Go away! Find another place to hide, Steve! There isn't enough food for more people up here! All right all right, fine!   Harrrh!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts. Face it, we're gonna starve! Those are cherry! Ich! How? Call the fire department. He's homeless now. We aren't safe. Not yet. It's only a matter of time. If we have to! Siddown Glen! SIT... doowwwnnnn! A bus! A bus is coming!   Don't leave us!  Oh Glen! We made it!  Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?! P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff. How painful is "painful"? Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon? Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what? Come on! That's pretty impressive!   Look what your old man made. Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first. Well ''he's'' gotta see this.  No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying! Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard.  Hey guys! Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.  Well I don't know about ever...  I guess it was pretty big.  It wasn't bigger than mine was.  Mine... mine was bigger.  You wanna see it? Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.  That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?   Aw crap! The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.  Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning. Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.  Courics... But that means... Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!  You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!  Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.  What? Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.  Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!  I would need a lot of help. I say...  YYEEAAHHHH! Oooooo. Can I, can I see it? Ahhh... In Zurich?  I can't do it! I can't do it! But then, does it still count?  No... Nooo... I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon?  I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono. Oh God, here it comes!  Yeah, I'm...  Feel a lot better.  Sharon, what are the boys doing? They can play guitar now? Ohhh. Hey yeah...  So you boys like this music, huh?  I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how? But... But this is real.  No way! Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh... Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.  I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now? NOO! NOOO, I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON! That's us! Good luck! Randy? Randy, what happened? No. We can't be. What happened, Glen?  It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here! We're gonna be all right! You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever. I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football. How come they just let that Bono guy send a ''picture'' of his crap? Come on, Randy, what do you say?! Fourteen?!  Come on, Randy. You have to push!  There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot. Hehey!  Butters! Butters! What are you doing?! Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this!   Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this? Don't ''lie to me, Butters!'' I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious. You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters.  Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious. You see? What can I do, Father? A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.  Thank you so much for taking him in. There you are, Butters! What's he done now?! Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change. Well you know somethin'? So do I.  And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere. What happened? No. All the phone lines are completely down.  We can't just leave them out there. This isn't happening! Ask her what's happening. I knew they'd come back for us! Why are they turning? They're... they're leading them away! Oh, hey Randy. I've never heard of one that big. Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history! But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!  Hey. Hey that's right. Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken! That's great, Randy! We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling.  Butters, time for breakfast.  Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you. You ''are'' in Imaginationland. ''This'' is a dream.  Well good for you, Butters. Well, guess we don't have to ground him.  Hey Randy!  That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town! Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die! Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard? The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  That's right, yes. And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was! Right. But we survived. Poor kid. Yeah!  Our imagination?  Can we just drop this, please? I don't wanna talk about it! No, he's not.  Is he? I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but- Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay? Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it. Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that. Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson. Well, yeah. Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!  He told my dad he was... Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word. God dammit! Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad! I'm not responsible for what my dad did! What the hell do you want from me?!  Then stop being mad! What was his point? Dude, I don't get it.  Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it. Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.  Yeah. I totally don't get it. Come on, let's go.  What'cha do to Butters this time? Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him? You are now. You can't! Because it's really, really funny. That isn't funny. Aw man, I've got H O R S now.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!  What do you think happens if you ''do'' have it? Somebody in this class? You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere! Yeah... Or you.  Why are you saying that, Kyle? You ''can't'' be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?! You had head lice? Dude, we totally got let out of school. Russian? So he's a Hillary Clinton fan. Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere. You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling.  Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger! Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this? Right, so, why do we color eggs?  Yeah, but why? So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them? You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.  I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it! All right, can you explain to me what's going on? What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  Answer me! I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall! No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this!  Mom? Dad?  Anybody home? Dad! You've gotta help me!  Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me! They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  Dad? Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!  Does Mom know about this? ''I'' don't understand! Could, could you, take off, the ears, please? So what is the secret of Easter? Grandpa's in it too? Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time? You mean the old Galveston Lodge?  Must I? Hi Grandpa. ...Stan. Yeah. Yeah, I wanna know already. Where am I supposed to go? Jesus Christ!  Oh no...  Help. My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs? Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men?   My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow. Just bread... He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope. He looks like a guy.  But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church? I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball? They found me! If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants. What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go! Okay, fine.  You said "hand over the bunny." Hey, what the hell! Jesus, you did answer my prayer!  No! No!  Snowball!  All right Jesus! Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut. Uh oh, this isn't good.  No ma'am. Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend. Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay? We don't? Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that. That's it, that's the whole story? You guys, school starts in ten minutes!  You didn't finish your essay either, right? Again? These guys are pretty good.  Sir, could you move a little, please? Well dude, what are ''we'' supposed to do? Yeah, it's all set. That was a sweet idea, Kyle.  Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house? I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on. Kyle, what were you thinking? Dude, it's our dads. Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents.  Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town. Over here!  Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house.  Are you the head of Homeless Studies? We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday- There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them. Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now! What the hell happened here?  We, just came to ask a question. Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem. Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump! What?  But then you didn't solve the problem, you just ''moved'' it! Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this! No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle! All right, I'm turning around Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle. No way! No, never.  Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready. Gee, thanks a lot, Dad. You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand.  Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please? Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap. That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one? Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for ''anything''. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most ''Sports Illustrated'' subscriptions sold.  Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off? All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2. Agh! I take it back! You're not number two! What is wrong with that guy? What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?! So Bono's newest record ''is'' a lie! So? He's the record.  Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours. Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record! Dude. That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit. Dad, are you all right? Dude... Cool. Where'd he go?   Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place? ...What do ''you'' know about the leprechaun? Who the hell are you? Come on, guys.  What is this place?  Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a- Butters.  Hello? No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live? Yeah! How'd you know? Why? Dude, do you really have to do it? What is this place? Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland. Dude, we don't remember. No. Your what? If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us? That's not very imaginative. The Imagination song? <poem><i>Imagina-he-hey-</i></poem>  Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid. Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation. Dude, you did make a deal...  Wait, woodland critters...  Get them out of there! Tell them to get away now! KYLE!!   Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you. ...Oh that makes sense.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down. Kyle? What's happening? What?! You can't let them do that! Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone! No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.  No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place. So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again. The Chosen One?  Kyle? Kyle, what happened? What?? Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke! Well you have to convince them they ''are'' real! Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.  Kyle! Dude! How did you do that, Butters? Dude. Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us!   Dad? Dad! What are you doing?! Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.  Dude, we are total rock stars now!  Hang on. Yeah? Yeah, we did.  Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager! That'd be awesome! Wow, this is a huge party. Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News!  Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos! Are you serious?? Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday. Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us. Yeah dude, that's almost impossible. Really? That'd be sweet. What, you mean, Kyle? But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system. Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level? Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"?  ...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick. This is um, Thad Jarvis. Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincade thinks I should play with Thad for a while. I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part. Don't put this all on me, Kyle! You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,- Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true! Let's just do this, all right?  It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.  Huh? Hero-Heroin Hero? And there's no score? No crowds?  Dude, this is awesome. Ugh. Damnit.  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?! Yeah? Well, I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick! Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music ''I'' wanna play! We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song! You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did! I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time!  Man... Just, just a little. I know, but it mellows me out, okay?! No problem. Huh? What, uh? The dragon. Where did it go? No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game! I just wanna find something else to play. I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that? Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes? Please, it- it won't take long. I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better.  Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there. That isn't it at all.  I know. I need you.  ...with my best friend.  Yeah. I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it. What, you mean it?  All right, dude, let's do this.  Aw, Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox! No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero! You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad!  Mom, will you get Dad out of here? That's it? Dude, Butters, calm down. Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account? It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one. And then Tolkien, and then me. Cartman, lay off! You're next to last. Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember? Who cares what dumb girls think, right?  Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you? Just for a minute. Over here.  Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made. The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?  So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list. Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last? Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy? NO. I have no idea what you're talking about. That didn't sparkle with her, did it? What's going on? Jesus, dude!   Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.  Kyle! Kyle, don't! The list was a forgery, Kyle! It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list.  It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up. Wendy! Wendy!  Here, Kyle.  Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle? ...Abe Lincoln? Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  I can't believe you said the N-word on national television! Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real.   Randy!  Flush the toilet for Christ's sake! Randy! All right, will you flush the toilet now?!  Why?! No, we are flushing the toilet right now- Oh, for the love of God, Randy!   Randy Marsh! What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?! Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!  You have ''got'' to be kidding me. For the love of God!  Come on guys, lasagna's ready. What are you talking about? Randy, this is ridiculous!  Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap! Wha? Wha? Oh no.  Agh!  What?!  Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together. No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the gameplay. If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish. Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live? I don't know. Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate. I have no idea. I don't get it either. ...Huh? Is this all you brought us here to see? Butters is staying over tonight?  Butters. Don't you think it's a little ''strange'' that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over? I mean, that if-  Dude! No dude, that makes ''you'' gay! You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes ''you'' gay, stupid! Yeah huh! Doesn't matter. You're gay now. No-no wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman. The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put ''your'' wiener in ''his'' mouth. Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.  ...Idiot. What are you talking about, fatass? You figured that out, huh? Except for us. And all the people we tell. Like what? Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't. Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on. Okay, my turn.   Where's what? Let go of me. Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture. I don't have it. Shut up. Ow! Quit it, dude!  He isn't actually going to show everyone... You know what? I'll bet it was ''you''! This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself! Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal. It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all. It was him. It ''had'' to have been him! What's this about, Cartman?  That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, ''The Thing''! You saw it in ''The Thing'' and you're wasting everyone's time! Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air! All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test. It doesn't prove anything! No way. Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.  It was me. I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.  Yeah? What? No, I'm sick.  Dude, leave me alone.  What? Why? All right, all right.   Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about? Over a hundred. White Stripes What? Dude.  Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school. I guess so. Wuh what doesn't follow? Okay.  Yeah. Actually, there is. There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  So then maybe you're wrong. Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street. Yeah.  What is that? God damn it Cartman! I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos. Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally. No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally? Oh that's a good idea.  Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay. Hey.  What's going on? ...Homeland Security? Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it! Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing. Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.  ...Not anymore you're not. I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British. All right! MapQuest the address! Good thinking Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us. ...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims! ...Maybe.  ...That is so missing the point. The-that's not the right way to look at it, I- No! ...Not... not like you're saying. What happened? ...I'm kind of finger painting right now. Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea. Hi, we'd like to speak to a  The history of Easter. It kind of looks like... an egg. Who is Saint Peter?  Peter Rabbit. I don't see it. I don't believe it. So... the Vatican took Stan's dad? So what now? You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over? I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket. You swore on the cross, fatso! Don't you have any superpowers? What? N-no way! Do it yourself. Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.  Don't make me do this. Eric Cartman can never know about this. Happy Easter, Jesus.  ...Jesus? Oh God, here we go again. Our whole weekend is shot. They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes! What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us. He catches the feesh so, then he can make money. You said you all wrote essays. Dude, we're totally fucked now! This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail! Son of a bitch!  Jimmy, did you finish your book report? We're dead.  Really? Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something.  Fine. You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something. Really? Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind! God damn it, that wasn't my idea! Hi. I've uh...   No, that... I thought that was a lot.  Oh crap.  I don't know. He did? Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night. Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There ''has'' to be another reason. I don't want you to jump them, retard! Oh my God. Holy shit, dude!  Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy. You barely made it over one, fatass! God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a- What's it doing?  What about you? We're nine. Shut up, Cartman! Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over ''one'' homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over ''that'' guy! You son of a bitch.  I knew it! It ''wasn't'' because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!  No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea. That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it! We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other! All right, hit it. Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there.  Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal? What?  He's faking. You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass! Who cares about saying whatever you-? Grrhh, whatever.   Will you knock it off already?! Don't push me, asshole!  No! Up yours, fatboy! Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!  N-no, I'm just saying that I think- L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun. Dude... Aw, come on! Ah, I was just trying to... just, just in one instance...   I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh-  What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?! Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny! ...Scotch? You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman! It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice!  What did you say? You aren't gonna get away with this you ''stupid asshole''!  Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position? You sure you don't wanna back out? All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  Surprise, fatass! I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.  What? No, I- I beat you! This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story. Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home! This is fucking retarded! Yeah, and if you ''couldn't'' prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid! Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made! You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up! Dad, where do leprechauns come from? So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack? I thought I did.   Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner! I'm not doing it, fatass! Just get ''out'' of here! I don't care if I signed an agreement! That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls. Hey dudes.  How was what? I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to! Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this. All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary! Dude.  '''Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!'''  Dude!  A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God.  Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.  ...And then it got attacked by terrorists? Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind! What did they say??  ...Dude... I... Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now? Let's just get this over with! God damnit! Who are you?  We have to get out of here!! We just... went on a balloon ride. ...What? Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination? Ah I guess. Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there. No, no dude, it went up there. <poem><i>Imagina-eh</i></poem> Right, ''then'' it was <poem><i>"Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"</i></poem>  Cartman?? I didn't think there was going to be a goddamned leperachaun!!!  Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!  Stan? I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government! Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to- Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with! No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it!  Just get to it already! Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with! Let's just ''do it!!''  AAAHHH!  AAAAAAAAAAAA-  Stan?  Stan? Cartman, what's happened? No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?! Arh! Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?! Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger? Cartman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on. Oh for the love of God! Stan! Dude, is that you? No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination. Dude, what's happening? Oh no. The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland. What am I supposed to do? Stan? Stan??  I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked! No, I don't! The decision was overturned.   Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls! Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke. Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head! Nothing.  They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real! No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls Huh?  Oh boy... Jesus, I can't do anything.  Uh, hello? Jesus?  Aah. Yeah, I guess. Hi Superman.  I know. Oh God... Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore. You have to stop! Because I-  Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am ''never'' sucking your balls,  '''''there!!!''''' Cartman, don't! I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary! I am not sucking Cartman's balls! Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero. Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating.  For reals?  Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials.  Oh my God! ''Do'' we? He's a legend!  Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool. D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that? Oh, okay. Cool.    Who is this? Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan? But it's our game. We bought it together. Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?! I ''have'' been sick!  I'm not done yet. No. You're thinking of somebody else. Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Can I get a Fresca, please? Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters. I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet. Thanks, Mick. What are you doing here?  Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five.  Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities!  Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship!  You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore!  It was pretty fun, wasn't it? Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway. I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all! I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec? Thanks, Mick!  Goddamnit... Goddamnit.  You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time. You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?!  Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Tolkien and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me? No way. I'm last? Last? I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class? The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy. Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I-I didn't think I was the very ugliest. Oh God! I do?  Ah! Ike, Ike, you ''have'' to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me! Hello.  Yeah.  No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly! No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.  They all laugh at me!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face. Who said that? Abraham Lincoln? But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now. Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home! I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!  That should just about do it.  All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this! Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity! Huh?? Stan, what is going on?! So what number was I?? She's gonna kill us? I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up. Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen! I watched it on YouTube about sixty times! Yeah, well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Tolkien.  He is gonna wanna kick your cracker teeth in. Ohhhhhhhh? Oh, shit, here we go!   Yeah, come on! Here we go!  Race war! Come on! Race war! Tolkien forfeits!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again! No! Dude! No fucking way!   Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha... Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him.      Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry! Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?! Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha! It's a midget, dude. Hahaha, no- no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much.  Say "Uncle!" Hahaha, now say "Carol Anne, don't go into the light!" Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh! This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one. Oh no, there's much more.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass. Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to- Heh!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.  Weren't you guys? Kyyyle! What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life. Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon. Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God! It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth!  I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good! Because that makes Butters gay now! Eh- ...what?  Nuh uh. Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh? But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys! No, no, it was a stupid mistake! No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How-how can I reverse this? How?  Really?   Butters. Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you. It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever! You ready? Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees! Hang on a second here.  'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?   That's good, just like that. ...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth.  All right, you ready?  Uh!  Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!  I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!  Right, except for you.  Why would you tell anybody? ...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier. Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.   Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody! Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts ''me'' way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody. Oh right, like ''that's'' possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is ''your'' face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Where is it, you filthy Jew?!  You know God damned well what! I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!  Give it back, Kyle! I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here. ''You'' shut up! You're lying, and  NYAAAAAAAAAA! Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski. It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!  Why... why does that matter? All right. It's a picture ...of me. It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth. No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture! Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep. I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell! That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  Ow. OW. OW!  I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow! Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee. Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.  Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have. But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay!   You, you will? It is?   What? Mom, she's lying! Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!  Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh. Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction! HA! , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps? And now this next picture  And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial.  Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft. What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-  ...Lame. Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it. Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.  This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home. Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened? Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right? Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?  That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast! All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you!  Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself! Me?! I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what ''you'' would do if ''you'' had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me! That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan.  And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing!  There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it!  All right, lock that door, Craig!  I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.  This is a scientific test, designed to- I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?! If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it ''might'' work and reveal that they were the ones with lice! Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you. All right, now everyone back over there!  Yeah? Let's just see what ''your'' blood does, Kyle!  It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH!  Kenny! Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice!  He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  What, Clyde? All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it! Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?! Guilty! I thought so!  All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks!  Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?! Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?! But that means... that means Kenny ''was'' lying! Sock bath!  Uh oh!  Duhude, dude, ''[throws out his arms, palms out] not cool!'' Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo. What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs? No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.  Kyle, are you on your computer? Get online. I need you to check something for me. Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger! Get online now! Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.  Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?  Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?  That's funny. He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.  The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.  I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now! If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this? Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.  Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?! Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow! Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce! Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!  What? Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park! He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away! I said I will only talk to the President! LALALALALALALALA! LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA! President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line? Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now! Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid! Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address? Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready? It's my balls!   Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.  Yes, Mr. Thompson? Why? Did you find something?  A snuke?  I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you? Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you.  Big surprise! Let me have time with him. We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!  Where is the detonator?!  I can do this aaall day. You can make it stop! Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!  Where is your son?! Answer it!  Butters. We got him! I know where he is! No no, he's my lead.  You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is!  Uuugh!   Where is the detonator! You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One! Stop, terrorist, or I ''will'' shoot you!  Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore. Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy! That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading. Uhh yes, of course? The Russians? The Germans? The Germans again? You can't possible mean...? Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology. Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool. But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right? Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America. Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?! Yes or no, Kyle?! But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right?  Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice. And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?! Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you! Bye, Easter bunny!  Have you lost your mind? You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay. No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things. ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? ¿Sí? ¿Trabajo?  "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "E Old Mand Y La Mer". Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia. Okay, gracias. Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass. They'll be done.  All right, did you read the book? All right, did you write the four essays? Okay, let's have 'em. Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?! Crap!  Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports. That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian! All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.  Get out of here! No, Kyle's right, you guys. We ''should'' do something. Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do. Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready? All right, here we go! Jimmy?   Yes! There's a bunch outside my house too. No! Fuck off!  Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible! You what?!  Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle! You see what you did, Kyle?! They're everywhere!  Aw man, it ''really'' smells like Kenny's house down here. Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together. All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof. I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people. I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty. Cool. Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny. Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town. Youu heard about that? Thirty was hard enough. Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town. Let's hope to Christ this works.   <poem><i>California<br />Supercool to the homeless</i></poem> <poem><i>Californiania<br />Na na orn nea</i></poem>   That's pretty kewl. Let's see...  The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-   Are you talkin' to me?! What's your problem, kid?! What?  Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?  All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble? ''Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance]'' haha. HahaHAAhahahaha.  I don't need the toy! I've found something better! ''[dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!'' Puh- pussy! Pussy! Cock! Shit!  Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls!  ...Cocksucker! Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls! But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say. Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. ''Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look]'' Shit! Butthole!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface! Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition. ...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble. Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle. Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy!  Dicktits! Shit! Asshole!  Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness. Tampon! Tampon DICKshit! Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE. Kyle please! I'm sorry! That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina! Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle. You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it? Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fag Jew! Jew bitch! Thank you. Big-nosed kike!  Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!   Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.  Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?  Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy. Then the game is on, Kyle.  Uhh nuh-nothing... Hm. That was... weird.  And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  What the hell is going on? No hey ut what, what I ''meant'' to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh,    Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say? Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it!  Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!  Ah, I need to be going now.   Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show. My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine. No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.  But I'm not gonna do the- I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show? You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say. No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!   How does he do that? Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you ''especially'' can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle. Kyle? Kyle, what are you doing? Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle! I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man! You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  All right, let's try over here.   Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy? Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out.  O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie? Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position!  Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you ''must'' suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you.   Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot! Faggot, I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five. It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!    Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!    Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening? Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes. Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth. We had a deal, Kyle!  You signed an agreement, Kyle!! Thank you, Mr. Broflovski. And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and ''still'', my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!  Yesss! Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls. Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives. He has to. He's been ordered by the court. What? Move aside, move aside!  Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls. Yehehehesss. Yehhhs!   No! No, he has to suck my balls!  Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger. I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...    (echoing) Aaaaahhhh... NO! I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time. Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?! Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!  Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?! That kid you have made a bet that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!  validated by the United States court system! Theee conference room is which way?  Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you. Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls. Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.   extra vinegary... I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think? No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth? In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually-  Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet. No! Goddammit, no! No! Kyle can't die.  Kyle?  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!  Do it! DO IT!  Come on buddy. Come on buddy.  Wake up, Kyle.   Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling? What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I ''could'' prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.  let's see Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  My balls! Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?  Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame? ...What? Where are you going?! Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.  We had a DEAL KYLE! IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!  What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?! You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real? Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?  No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit! Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything! Kyle? So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle.  You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.  O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls!  O-hoo Kyle, you are ''gobbling'' those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle? No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real. Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls.  Stan, you guys are good!  Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh. Real guitars are for old people.  Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points! Oh my God this is so awesome. All right, Stan, you've got it, man! Come on guys. Let's get out of here.  Stop cheating, Craig!  'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole! What? Butters, you wanna play me next?   They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?  Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about. Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you! No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor. Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married. All right, Bebe, let's see the list. You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class! Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him? Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them. All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right? She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  At 1 PM tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls. Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good? Bail, bail!  Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls. Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground. Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention!  We got it! We got it!  Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door!  What?! That's bullcrap!  You're last, dude!  Yes way! Check it out!  So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm better looking than you!  Kyle?  Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning on the news. Uh, well, actually it ''is'' kind of a big deal, Stan. It may be a mistake, but ''you'' don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal. That's easy for you to say, Stan. That doesn't mean I can just be fine. If you ''really'' think it's not a big deal, then you ''really'' are ignorant. That's all. I'm not ''fighting'' anybody.  Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.  You just don't get it, Stan!  Sooo black people are midgets?  I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it! No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either! Nothing! No! Now you get it, Stan.  Thanks, dude. Yeah. Me neither. What the hell?!   ... I don't want the code name Blackie. Whoa. Go Stan! Yeah, Stan! Who do they say is the ugliest? I'm number two? Wow.  The puzzle you were solving was "people who annoy you". Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.  Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?  Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing.   Kiss it. Apologize. Kiss it. That's right.  Apologize.   Ready to go, sir. Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today. We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off.  Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat?  What?!  Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?! My God, they hid it under the stage?! Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes. A what?! No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?! Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz. What do we do? Can we disable the timer? But then that means... You're doing great, Ms. Clinton. They'll find the detonator, Hildog.  I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.  All right. I'm nearing her snizz now. It's dark... cold... Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device!  There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something...   There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me! Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh! It's... eating my head! It's eating my head!   Yes? Over here? Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson! Are you okay, hon? Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious. I'm Allyson.  A midget? Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget!  C'mon now Eric, come on now.  Yeah.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too? Yeah Kyle? Uh what do you mean? Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle. So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while? But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.   Whoa, hey Eric.  A surprise? What is it?  Oh boy! Y-yeah!  How come uh, I can't see? Oh uh, ho yeah.  Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya? Well okay! Whoa! Hey Dad!  I'm getting a surprise!   Hey. Where'd Eric go? Like what? What's... bi-curious? Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious.  ...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright. Really? Whoa boy! Camp! Because I'm bi-curious? I'm bi-curious. He's bi-curious too? Well sure, I guess. Well yeah, sure. Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear? Yes, it's all very confusing! ...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato! Awww, that's okay, Bradley. Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home! Wuh-what's the matter? Well I like you too, Bradley. Well yeah! Sure, I like like you a lot lot.   No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy! I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast. Oh no, my Dad? Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.  Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look? You're perfectly normal, Bradley.  You know what I think? I think maybe ''you'' are the ones who are confused! I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself!  No. I like bein' bi-curious. Wait. Now I ''am'' confused. Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in ''my'' hair. Yeah! Dumb girls!  Heh hey guys, what would I do? Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice. Me too.  Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers? Well all right!   Oh hey Eric.  Hey, I was about to win! Awwwww. But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas. You have to be careful with scissors.  Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.  Uh hey Eric! Wuh who are you talking about? You... you and your cousin touched wieners?  This is faggot. Go ahead. Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh. Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun! Wow. Uhhh, are you gonna rape us? Ah, all right then. Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us. Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas! Don't leave me, fellas! Come back!  Hey guys!  Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry. Uh what's the Barrier? Me?? Woo, what am ''I'' supposed to do?  Waaahaa! Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists ''feel'' better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along. Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?  Hold on, fellas! Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.  Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it. Huh?  No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed! Oh hamburgers!  WAAAA! It's Alien!  Please, sir. I have to get home to ''my'' world. Really? How much further to Castle Sunshine? What was that? Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes? Wait! Waaait!  Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters. I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy- Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest! Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key. But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off... Wuh, what can ''I'' do? What powers? Ah I don't understand. I c-I can? How? How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!  I'm trying! GAA HAA! Santa. Saaanta. Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta!  Huwhoa!  Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here! Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland? Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key. More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!  Huh...  Well I just... used my imagination.  A-huh? What? Oh! It ''was'' all just a dream. Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!  Wait, I'm not grounded. Oh yeah?   Ahhh, shit. Stan and Kyle are really good at it. They're gonna do it! Wow wee, look at him go!  Uh ohhh... He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it! Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it! Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom!  They're gonna do it!  Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party.   Fellas! Fellas! It's- Oh my god! You're not gonna believe this! Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest. I dunno. I don't know. I-it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them.  You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.  Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.  Neat-o!  Okay!  They sure don't. You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?  Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is! Whoopie!     I would like to share with you all my- That, that words are like bullets. And if you give- No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon.  Principal Victoria, I am very concerned about the behavior of one of your students. Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all.  I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks. You don't understand.  You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder- You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless. You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.  No matter how you act, I can rise above it!  Shut your fucking mouth! He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking  Aaaaaaa! Excuse me, over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here.  I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, "Hello, fatso!" He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets.  Now you know how it feels.  You'd better shut up or i'm gonna kick your ass!  Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point. AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay!  Okay, you win! Ung-cle! Carol Anne, don't go into the light! There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size.   Eric, be quiet! Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay? Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.  Nice one, Randy. Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay? Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight. And so I said to my wife, "You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!"  Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the "ni**er" guy.  Say, "Hi, 'ni**er' guy!" That's all right, "ni**er" guy. You know we just playin'.  Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're right out of "Far Out Space Nuts". Maybe "ni**er" guy has one. You got one, "ni**er" guy?  Hey, it ''is'' him. You homeless or homeowners? ''Heard'' about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump. Well, that was easy.  Oh my God. Hi, "ni**er" guy!     You aren't welcome in this store, "ni**er" guy.  Ma'am, is that your son over there? Tourette's Syndrome? Oh... Yeah. It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it. Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?  Okay, is that everything, little boy? Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible. Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people. Mr. Nelson!   Good morning, Eric.  It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave. I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation.  No. ...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.  With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice?  How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls! Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later. Yeah. That's true. You were right all along, Eric. It ''was'' Kenny. Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it!  All right, let's do this! He had cooties and he lied about it! I thought I was the only one.  He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy. If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.  If I could yell "tampon dickshit" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy. If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.  Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy. Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe? No way. Dude. He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude. Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play.  Dude, this game rules. Dude, what's the matter with him? Oh man, I can't watch this. How was ''that'' cheating! They did it! So who do they say is the cutest? You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list! You don't think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom? We got the list from the girls!  Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I? Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso!  Could somebody toss the football back? It's over there next to the ugly kids.  "Hello, fatso!" Is this "ni**er" guy serious? Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV! Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, "ni**er" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance. Michael Richards? Well, son of a bitch! Well what is this? A "ni**er" guy convention?  Come on, Skeeter.  These "ni**er" guys ain't worth our trouble. We've reached the rally site, Hildog. Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin' You goin' to Washington to visit family?  Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip. Where you goin' "ni**er" guy? Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on "Wheel of Fortune"! What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans! Huh? Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us ''two'' "ni**er" guys! Who?   Goddamn ni**er guy's tryin' to be all political-like now! That did not seriously come out of your ass. Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy! Wooo!  You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im! Hey... That's that other "ni**er" guy. That's the guy from ''Seinfeld'', used the N-word a whole ''bunch'' o' times. Mark Fuhrman? He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.  Leave him alone.  Make that three. We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.  You'd better come with us. Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee. We're all just like you. I made a mistake too.  I was trying to be ''funny''! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.  Oh, you don't like that, do ya? Yeah! That's right!  We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence. Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all. They were Mexicans. I was being ironic. "Ni**er guy"? Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill.  All those in favor to ban the term "ni**er guy"? Opposed? The motion is passed!  Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that "ni**er guy" could become a slur that refers to all white people? I'm certainly not a ni**er guy. I've never thought a racist thought. From now on, if a person uses the word "ni**er," it must be at least seven words away from the word "guy."   Aw, come on, you're the biggest ni**er guy in Washington.  Nay? Aye! For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use. Tom, it appears that the ni**er guy epidemic is ove-  Oh dammit I said it, didn't I? (Ehe, that makes you ''very'' fucking gay.) (What? Fuck you!) (Hey! Fuck off!)   (Not guilty!) Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop! (What the hell are we going to do?!) (Uh oh...) (Yeah, what are ''we'' supposed to do?) (Yehes!)  (Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!) (What are you gonna do?) (They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?) (Woohoo!)  (Aah-)  What's going on, you two?  Huh? Closing it down? They can't do that.  The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us. We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently. Really? Anything, Stephen? You have to let them in, Randy. No, no wait, there's still a box over here. Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay. Randy, what are you doing?  And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off? All right! Our darling Butters never came home last night. You are grounded, mister! Way to go, champ. Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused? Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you. There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured. Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters. Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters. <poem><i>The Lord is love this for<br>With Jesus I can just say no<br>And not be confused anymore.</i></poem> Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be. Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters? That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy.  Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy? Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed.  We've got another one: Room 22. We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you. Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids! That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip.  You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell? And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye? Then do you mind telling us why we found ''this [holds up a magazine with an aroused male model on one of its pages]'' 1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room? You know this is strictly forbidden!  This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?! This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids!  Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days! Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?! You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk. Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you, you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity? We're fixing your confusion! Oheh- hey Dad. Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy! Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley! No no, we're fixing you! Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you! You get back. You're only gonna make things worse. Get back! You're just as confused as he is! He's coming down!  Through the power of Christ we have saved this child! Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6 Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22. Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls. So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7. That's... that's mine. Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble. I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused. You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great.  Uh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought! I think, I, I th-, I think I like you. You do? You ''like'' like me? Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves!  Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God! It's too late. I'm not normal. I'll never be normal! Yeah. I think. I think I'd like to come down now. Aw, darnit!  So you say you were robbed.  If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one? Okay, what is the picture of? Well how are we gonna find ''your'' picture unless we know what it is? Yes?  ...I see. Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury. Well then, you're screwed.  Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened. Oh, now why would he do that? What ''is'' the picture of, Eric?  Ohh, that's nice. Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen. It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother. Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother. Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth. Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine. You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture. She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it. She said she was sure, Eric. Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it. It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse. Oh... Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"? Oh Doctor, can you help him? Is there a problem, sweetie? Hello? Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.  Excuse me? Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease. Oh, thank you Eric. Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary. Oh,hello Eric.  Kyle, your friend is here. Whatwhatwhat?! Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes. What? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable! You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father.  Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way. Kyle, come back here!  They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick!  Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell.  Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first. Eric, what the hell is this?! All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about. No, I mean the problem of head lice.  There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here. So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined. I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone ''has'' the lice, we can stop it before it spreads.  Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started? With what? Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken. Uh, yes. That doesn't matter, it's over. It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?! The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history.  Ulysses S. Grant- Yello? What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!  Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses! All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone ''try'' to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem. Welcome to our class, Baahir. Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?  Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?! Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists! What the hell?  All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, "Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!  Did I say something to you, sugartits?!  You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, "The Old Man and the Sea"! Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done! If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?! They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are!  I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how ''hot'' you look! Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage. Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.   Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so. Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking.   scissored all night long. But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.  Teeheeheehee. Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?  -when we multiply a negative number by another negative-? Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-  Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers Kyle, watch your language!  Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore. Eww! Somebody might have lice? And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them! Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.  What? That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it! I'm not...  Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor. Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls? The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses. All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing.  Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee! I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls? Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up! Did you see these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible! Right? No, it's a little strap. If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away!  Oh please, you're lying.  Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.  Dude. What? Oh my God. Oh Christ no! Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever! Yes they are! This is so... embarrassing. I have... I have AIDS.   But why me, doctor? ''Why me?!'' How did I get this?! ...Sick! Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell. Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over. What? What are you gonna do to him?  I... nothing. Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students. Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!  You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes? Wait, wait! What? Wait a-wait a minute, what? No, I got it done.  He won't make it. This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by.  Hey, he's here.  If it's just looks then I think I'm safe. All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it! What number am I on? Me?   Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice. Hey, what's goin' on? Hey. What's goin' on?    Butters, that's not cool, man.  Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too. Ewww! Ohhhhh. Yeah! Yay!  Hello, Kelly. How's my baby? I mean both.  How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?  You mean me or the little one? Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay. Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay? Travis? Everything okay? Hope? What it, it's just rain. My God, Travis, they're all dying! Travis! I can't... hang on! Nooooooooooo! Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our baby is gonna grow up in.   The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.  If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it. If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen! I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.  Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all! Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our baby. I want to name her... Hope. Hope for a... chance at tomorrow?  Oh my God.  We have to get out of here! We have to get out of here now, Kelly!  Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly!  Don't look, Kelly! Don't look! I don't think so!  Kelly! Hang on! You have to! For the baby!  Kellllllyyyyy! No! Noooo!  Hope. Hope, you're alive.  Heh?! How many survivors?  You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!   This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet. First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even ''see'' another planet! We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?! Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times! You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my baby.  Not a chance. If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you.  It's real. Real as my love for my unborn baby. Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it. Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  Kelly. Luck had nothin' to do with it.  Why you murdering bastard! What the hell do you want, Vice President?! What are you going to do? Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead! Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my baby! Damn you! Why?! ''Kelly. Kelly, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our baby. But I let you down, babe. [blinks. A light shines on him and a vision of Kelly descends. Travis holds his left hand up as a visor to make sure he's not hallucinating]'' Keh... k-Kelly?  Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kelly!  All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked.  Have a seat on the stool.  Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em. You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?  Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor. I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel. And what do you base this on? Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense.  Poodiggery and poppycock! Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further. I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for? Oh, not much, just hanging around- Clyde Harris?   Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school.  Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there. This shampoo should take care of it.  Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them. That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.  ...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.  We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can. Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve. He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices. It's raining? Now?   What is that?  Whoa!  What the hell is it?!  OoOhOOOoooh! Well it's okay, we're safe up here!  I wanna know who it was, too. If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse? You thought you should be number one? Oh, hey Wendy.  Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.  Help me... Help meeee...  Travis.  Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead. Just the six of us. And the Vice President. What do we do now? How?  Who put you in charge?! I wanna go too. Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live.  So what exactly is your plan, Travis?  Sorry to cut the honeymoon short! Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk! Walk!  That's good! That's far enough!  I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President! It was a disaster! Disasters happen! Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis!  Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not "conscious," ''we'' are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel ''this''!  You die he-  Mark? Mark, you have to hang on. The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there. I'm not leaving my husband. Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing? Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.  I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here. We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone.  I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real. Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you. She was a lucky woman to have you. Ur ur re- ur really? I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up!  Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report ''and'', I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul.  Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun. Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it? Sucking Cartman's b-balls. Oh my sweet J-Jesus! Yeah! You are welcome here.  You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie!  Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today. Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists ''have'' obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her... In her snatch, sir.  The power went out! Hello, everyone!  Hello! Thank you. Okay.  Sure, okay.  The what? Leave me alone!  Upta! Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die. Really? Hello? From what? Who is this? Are you serious? Like what? Oh jeez. What?  This is CIA head, Alan Thompson. What do you know? I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me! Look, if you have information of a threat, you could- I will have you arrested for-! In her what? What?! Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch. A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina. It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him. Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever. Do we have that phone trace? This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the-  Well, we've just arrived in your town. Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz. That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off. We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop. Oh, hey. They claim they don't know anything about an attack. Mr. Hakeem, where is your son? You're not going alone.  The game is over! Get down on the ground! We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over! Well so then what time is it?  Take 'em down!   The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed.  Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again. Call is coming through now, Mr. President. Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know. Smile!  That's like recycling.  What are you boys doing? Get in.  What the hell were you doing outside?! You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... ''things''.  No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit!  Hello? Huh? Who. Hildog? What is it, Brian? Is the thread credible? No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly. Thank you, Chris.   This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is ''in'' towns like South Park that you find the true America!  How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh...  Oh, I declare! What is goin' on? I wasn't finished. What is goin' on, Brian?  Oh my. Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off? Hoh my! Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine. They know about the bomb! Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened. The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it! I understand, comrade. Are you almost ready to set off the bomb? That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight. That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston! Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack. Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour. People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton!  You're a lesbian now? The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it. I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then. Mrs. Garrison, get out of here. All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do?  Please, Mr. Valmer. Here we go!  We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it.  Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's... Oh my God, she got a scent!  The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists ''have'' hidden a bomb! Come on, find it. Find!  We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz? That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! ''Some''body is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually! All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch. What do you see, Brian? You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz. You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there. Say again, Brian. No wait, look.  Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.  The call is going through now, sir. Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area.  Donner, take over that station.  This department is being absorbed by Homeland Security! Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?! I am! That's outrageous! On whose orders?! What is going on? What have we done? We thought he was at school. He's not at school? I tell you, I do not know. He should be at school!  Hey! Wuh-what detonator are you ta-  Stop it! Really!  What are you going to do to my wife?! She doesn't know either.  I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?!  Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion! Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country!  Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.  I'm not sending any of ''my'' men in there. No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic! God help him.  Brian, get out of there! Brian? Brian, what's happening? Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running.  You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were ''paid'' to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!  Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?! America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy? Before that. Before that. Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!  It was good knowing you, comrade. Yes, but we will be rich. How did they find us? It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes!  What the hell?! Oh crap. No! I don't want to die without being paid!  Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!  This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying. What are you going to do? Are we just gonna let this go on?  Did he just inject himself with apple juice? All right, where? We'll send our people in. 'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!  Yeah well not anymore you're not. This department has just been assigned to the FBI. On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!  Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!  Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.   My legs. I... I think they're broken. Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out...  We told you: we don't know. Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters? Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage.   All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com. Are you tellin' me how to do my job? Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate! Where's the intel from? We do this my way! I'm the one in charge! Oh, snap.  Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now. Checking. Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park! I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.  Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat. We just read it on Drudge Report. The British?   Get in the van! Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty? Full sail, Your Majesty? The Rebel Americans know of our attack?! Fire at will!  Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution. The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail. Yes? I see.  Loyalist Red Coats! How? Ahh, don't you think that's-  Huh? Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume. Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid. I need a break. Can I have a break?  Randy? They found us!  Ohhh. Hey Bill. Evenin' Marcus. Heh heh hey, look at you! Hey everybody. Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited. There he is! There's my grandson! I'm proud of ya, Billy. Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit. All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball! Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter? Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that-  Hail Snowball.   They're everywhere!  Where is the rabbit?! Who did you give the rabbit to?!  Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far! I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is! Take him to be tortured! Where are you taking us? No! I'm not goin' anywhere!  What is it in regard to?   Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller!  Your father is in grave danger. Come with me!  Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before! Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's ''first'' award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960. So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? ''Because he is crap.'' Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...  Yes.  The Keepers?  The Guardians of the Secret? Come on in.  The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci.  Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table? Really? Look to Jesus's right.  The food which is a little different color than the others. Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of...  Saint Peter. Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit.  Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely. Look closelier.  Look ''more'' closelier.  The original Pope of Christianity. Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat.  for a rabbit. Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive. I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne.  Boys, get out of here!  You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit? Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell! The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?! Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian. Bill, this seems extreme. Yes, hand it over! We promise. Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need. Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian. It... can't be. What?! All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian. I am the Pope! Forgive me, Jesus.   The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over. Ya see?  We swear it, on the cross. Take them into custody!  Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone! Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross!  It is what Christ would've wanted! Kill him! He goes against the Church. He must die! You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them!  You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies! Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later. My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier!  Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit!  Why won't you go away?! Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God! In here!  PEEEEPS!  What's that?  As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection.  A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m-  AAAAAAAAAAH! Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit! Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.  I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things. Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan. This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter ''was'' a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope. What are you doing?!  What is your problem, guy?! We'll never get out in time to stop him!  Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me. Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars. Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle! Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately. My son, there is no time! Do it! I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter. Awgh!  Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent! One man cannot be the voice of the Church! Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position.   No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be. That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice!   Aslan, the evil characters are almost here! There are so many of them. HAAAAA!  Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus. What seems to be the problem, my child? Popeye, I need some help here!   All right! He did it! Jesus!  <poem><i> Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation</i></poem> <poem><i>Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-</i></poem> <poem><i>Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-</i></poem> Cool!  ''He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!'' Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq. Sorry, little bunny. Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives?  It isn't saying anything. Ohh, that's me Neato! Jesus? YAAAY! Whoa!  Yeis. Sure. Yeah, we can do that. Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh. No, because on the way home, the sharks come and eat the feesh. And so, he no make money.  Sí. Sí, we all wrote essays for you.  Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet. We thought it was kind of strange. Yeis. Sure. Sí.  Okay. No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge. Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator.   We looking work, sí. Okay. Okay no problem. That's no problem. Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh. I wrote my ese in Albuquerque. We looking work, sí. Okay. Yes. Sí.  Okay.  Okay. Hola, ¿como estas?  Yeah. Have what?  Yeah. Sí.  Hola. Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal. Sí. Sí, la samaraisia. So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh. I wrote three eses: my ese back home, my ese in Denver, and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back. "Thanks for writing me, ese."  No problem. Gracias. No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman. How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar? Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called "Lebow". Hi Linda, hi Kate.  Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy? Yeah. Well, most of the girls here have done each other.  You know.  Yeah. I... thought you understood that. I'm sorry. I thought you knew what "girl bar" meant. Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a- Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman? There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet. Could I... maybe kiss you?  Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go. Let's just have fun tonight.  Janet, you're crazy! Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet? Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives. Whattaya mean? But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians. Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian. How can you tell? Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone. Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now? Yeah, I've been told that. Girl bar? I never even knew there ''was'' such a place. Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other. He-yeah. Done what?  Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar? Oh jeez.  But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa.  I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs! Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women ''can'' make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something. I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated. Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense! Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson! Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!  Hey Tracy, hey Kate. Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on?  Hey Patty.  Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes. Oh yeah, dyke fight!  Yeah, this is our home. Persians?! We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body! Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians! That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away! Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!  Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke! Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up! We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn! I knew it! I knew it! Would you allow straight people in? Men? Choose your next words wisely, Persian!  No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos!  Lesbos! Positions!  The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes! Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Ow! Iranian faggot! Never! Lesbohhhs! Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic. We can't? I think it's pretty fun. Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside. If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner! It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing. ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo? All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner. Sure they do.  Persian. All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too. And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time. Take positions, Lesbos! No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans. Let them through. It's okay. Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal? A-are you sure? What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this? It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face. Because we're protecting the only home we have. You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am. That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman. I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves. Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside! Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before? Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes! Yeah, scissor! Thanks for everything, Xerxes. The school hired a substitute to cover for me. Hey Allyson. Allyson always goes for the butch ones. Who's the new girl? Sí, sí. Sí. Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. That's right.  All right! Ahh!   <poem><i>California</i></poem> <poem><i>In the city</i></poem> <poem><i>In the city</i></poem> <poem><i>In the city</i></poem> <poem><i>In the city</i></poem> Whoa... Butters! Butters!! Oh, let's go! Come on, let's go! Hi Janet. So where are we supposed to go? Well, here's to some great times at this place. What's up, Janet. Eewwww! Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl?  There's so many of them. You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news. What is it, Katie? They're closing down the bar. For good! Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians. Actually, it's "Lebow".  This is our home. Yes, we are. Here they come.  Wow!  The Persians are attacking again! Yeah, that's right! Huok! Huok! Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out. Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar. Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods. But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way. Well... we would allow whoev- Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy. Ohhhhh! How dare you!  And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. . All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff. The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in. The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering. For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating.  The Lesbos... had held. The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss. Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool.  And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization. A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee.  With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough? And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails. As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in. Good for them! You go girls!  Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help.  Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it! All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu! Come on, seriously, let us in!  Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.   Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle. I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself. Why are you lesbians being so difficult? I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this. Okay, how about this?  I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money.  How..? How did you find that out? You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this. You do? Seriously? No. I don't even know how two women... ''can'' make love. Unless they just kind of  scissor or something. Ohh, that feels so supercool! Ohh, I'm a new woman! No. Thank you, friend.  Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner. Get outside!  Spare some change? Oh! Aww. Got any more?  Spare any change?  Spare any change, sir?  Chaaange?  Eughuhuh. Well, I, I short of had an idea.  We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at. Ohh, that's a good one. Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it. Like it. Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.  That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it. If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.  Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh. Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please? Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?   Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus? Stop it! I really do need change!  Hello? Do you have any change? What? You do? Cha-a-ange? Well Kyle? Hey Randy.  Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster!  I doubt it.  Jesus... It's... other-worldly.  Oh yes there is! You could do it again! Think about it: you weren't even ''trying'' to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually ''worked'' at it! That's what we're here for.  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap ''in Zurich''. They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.  From Ireland. Doing what? Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it. What was the agreement? But he has his mother's nose. All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me! Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more. Go away, I I don't have any change. Yes. Who are you? Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on?  Jump them? Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory.  I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one.  They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance. But now watch.  It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here.  This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days. It's dying. I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it. Oh my God, they're coming in!  Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit! Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right! Sorry to take the easy way out.  Spare some change?  Got any change? Can you spare some change?   Chaaange?  Change? Change?  Spare some change? All right, God bless you, sir.  Spare some change?  South Park has become overrun with the homeless.  In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change. What the? You can't be in here. No I don't have any change. How did he get in here? No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any-   Spare some change? Ya got any change, sir? Chaaaaange?  Spare any change, sir? Change? Change sir? You got some change? Change, sir?  Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in. I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant. Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No!

He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead. The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no...  Cock!  Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit! Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit! Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT! N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT!

Hello Mrs. Garrison-  Piss! Faking?  You think people with Tourette's are faking?! Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say?  PISS! PIIISS! This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?! This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this "bully" to see that Tourette's is very real.  Piiiss. Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor.  I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!  Piiiss, coming from my aaass! Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so. So then you apologize for what you said before? Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities.  Piss! PISS! Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate.  Well I think we can all put this behind us now.  Piiiss out my aaass! We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome.  Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze.  Brrrrrrrrr! Fun?  Brrr, brrrrrr! A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic  Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I-  Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself.  I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from ''To Catch A Predator'', where we bust men looking for sex with children. Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there. What are you doin' here? But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado. This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado. Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen. Why not?  Why don't you have a seat? Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat, right over there.  What are you doing here? But you ''are'' doing the show. Well of ''course'' you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's. Why don't you take a seat? Have a seat. Take a seat, right over there. You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called "To Catch A Predator". We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna ''be'' on Dateline. Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself.  Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm  Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction. So now let's meet a child who haaas Tourette's Syndrooome, and who must fi-   What are you doing?! Sir, why don't you take a seat, right over there. Aw, not again. What the hell is going on?! Hey! Do you have something to do with this? Answer meee! What?! Nobody talks to me like that! Why don't you take a seat? Take a seat, right over there. Why, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you!  Oh God, whoa, no. I'm just bein' stupid, I guess. Five minutes, kid.  Hi, are you CuteBilly182?  Oh God, I'm so turned on right now. This is your house? Your, your parents aren't home, are they?  Ho, whoa, wait a minute. This ain't no house.  Chris Hansen?! Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it! Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv! Whoa!   Hey, I brought you some Wendy's. Score!  Oh no, it's Chris Hansen!  Whoa! Who is that? What's going on? Wait a minute. Oh God, it's Chris Hansen!  Chris Hansen!  Dateline?!  I knew it!  There aren't really brownies!  Aww shit! Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated.  Well, what food have you been eating? I'm going to prescribe a laxative.  But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful. Gross, Dad, sick!  Are you feelin' better? A football? That's amazing. Oh my freaking Lord. 'Cause he's Bono, that's why. With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of? Guinness World Records America. How can I help you?  Guinness World Records America.  You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their Web site.  I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified.  There's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on.  It is a crap sent to us from the United States. It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo. We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics! Verron snusunarich. I believe I detect some cabbage as well? The standard measuring unit for human feces. One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement. Herr Broloff! Herr Broloff!  It must be quite a crap. Herr Broloff, what do you know of this? You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff. It must be over a hundred Courics!  Very niiice.  Has it been checked for accuracy?  Hm, enshnusen? What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh? It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh. Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics. Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken. Yes, Bono, sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken. That's right. You are the new world's champion! What are you talking about, young man? My God... He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards, and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, ''and'' the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono!   Yes? What?! That's impossible! How big was it? Hello everyone! I, am Bono.  For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics. As you can see, it is one solid piece.  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hello, hello. He can't beat my nine and a half Courics! Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich. I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?  Let him have it? Why would I do ''that''?!  I have the first-place trophy for that.  I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.  Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK! Say I'm not number two! That's right! I'm not!  Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out! I had a feeling it would be. Get him out of here! It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead! Poppa no! Say nothing more! No Poppa... No Poppa... Biddy.  We are here to honor the first American to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken.  To present the award I give you the dean of the EFSM, Sir Orloff Broloff.  Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas- Das shpoitenhoff?  Ahhh ladies and gentlemen, I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono! Could we play the tape on the big screen, please? You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono!  Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know. Well he's going to try. Bono, we've never had that rule before. I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap. Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact. It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth. It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, ''I'' was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken. Come to me my... darling precious child.  After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.  Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he? I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time.  Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy. My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything. Have I?!  Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record! Oh! Bono? Cool! Bo-no! Woo-ooo! Stan Marsh? I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero. Tonight, a possible attack on Iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East. But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken? Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a ''new'' crap, spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's. . You just don't understand.  At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry, saying nobody has ever seen it in person. Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy. A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination.  Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on. The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them. Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination? Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.  A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination! Is this really newsworthy? You're right. I don't. Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first.  Okay, take a deep breath.  Sure.  I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester. The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean! Wow. You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack! I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near!   Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately? Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing? Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  imagination. Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine?  Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.  Ubeuh... uh... n... no? Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here. This... is Imaginationland.  Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun!   No! It's just a Care Bear!  They're going something to Rockety Rocket. The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier! The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side!  Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!! That was your plan to stop them?? That's fucking stupid!  This... is Imaginationland.  If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out!  Come on, wake up, kid! NO! You passed out and peed your pants! Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!  Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times. NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke!  Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope! Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain!   Oh look, I'm back! The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again. Whatever you imagine to be real, is real.  Hello.   AAAAAH!  Welcome to Imaginationland. I am the Lollipop King. Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do? Castle Sunshine?  Dude, run, run, ruuun!  Wait! There it is. We made it!  The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest? Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland The evil characters are here.   That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled! Oh my God.  We are honored to have Creators in our kingdom. What did he tell you? Did he have any news? Can you tell what the terrorists are doing? Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.   Awwwgh!  Quickly boys! Get on my back!   We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public.   Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement. Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild. What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them. That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam. ''[the camera zooms out a bit and shows the name tag in front of the man: the director M. Night Shyalaman] The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village'', all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists? N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda. No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?  No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!  Those aren't ideas, those are special effects! I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.  Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists? Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!  Who are you?... You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security. There's no time! You need to come with us right now!  We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information. Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.  What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?! Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering! That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?  Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret. Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?! THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!  God-dammit, Tom. Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called "Project Imagination Doorway." According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has. They've been saying that for over forty years. Song? You didn't say anything about a song before. Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go? I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety!  All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control! All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready? Are you ready, Kurt Russell? Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard! What?! Sector Two??  Who the hell are you?! Get him out of here! Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls? All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here. Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check? Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me? What do you ''see'' in there? Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack. What? What's the matter? Kurt Russell, what's going on?! Get out of there, Kurt Russell! Talk to me! What's going on?!  Look out!  Reverse the doorway! Send it back through! He's gone, little boy. We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild. By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination. We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters! Thank you. All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books. What?! Sector 2?  What? All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand! Prepare for launch... What?! Sector 2?  The hell are you doing back here?! Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?! If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do ''you'' care what happens? Abort the sequence.  There's been an abort, Mr. Gore. That's true. You did.  How? The imaginary attack appears to have been in the works for years. The effects of the attack are so far... unimaginable. In times like these the government often turns to Hollywood for help. You creative filmmakers can think of idea we just can't. Heyy... that's not a bad idea. All the imaginary characters in the tape were identified, sir. Count Chocula, Cinderella, Snarf from Thundercats... But here.  Yes sir!  That's them, sir. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski. There must have been some kind of portal or doorway. It was the Chinese, wasn't it? We've suspected that the Chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination.  Is that where you were?! It is better than ours? ''Our'' portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-  Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?  Is this not your signature on the contract? From what I've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds. You have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. If after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. Next case!  What if...  What if it turns out they aren't terrorists? But they're actually werewolves? From the future? But what if Al Qaeda, it turns out, is the group ''being'' terrorized? By aliens? How about we make everyone ''think'' that terrorists attacked us? But really, we were all already dead. I believe I can.  An eighteen-wheeler spins out of control and it's all like BROSSHH  I... don't understand the difference.  Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them! How about this? You have that tape that the terrorists made, right? Well, maybe if you did a background check on that videotape, you might find somebody who doesn't belong. Somebody who doesn't fit in Imaginationland! Ohhh!  No! Leave me alone! Haaa! No! No you can't blow up the barrier! Are you insane?!  No! Noooo!  AAAAAAAH! Jesus Christ, no!!  No!!  It doesn't make sense. What do they want with Rockety? We can't let this happen. Look! The evil of Imaginationland is coming out!  It will be the end of Imaginationland.  ALLAH!!   Ohh, I'm sorry sir. Yes sir.  We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-  Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir. Let me handle this!  Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right. Sir? Are you sure about this? Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus. Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell! Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real! Well of course ''he's'' imaginary! You okay, kid? But we're close, sir. We're real close.  You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination. What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out. What song? That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!  Was there more to the Imagination Song? Ha, how does the rest of it go? It's open! It's open! Entering the portal in five seconds. Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel. Something is... coming through the gate from the other side.  And half pig!  No! I think it's more like a half man, and half pigbear!  Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something. Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir!  What is it?! Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf? Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been.  Oh my God! Snarf.  Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf. And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf. The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack. Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf! We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours! Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control. Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here! What evil imaginary characters are they? Now kill her! Nobody here has AIDS! Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot! What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.  Your evil is stale!   Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them. Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear.   Whoa whoa, hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her. That's not evil enough. Now come on y'all. We can do better than that. Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS out in the forest.  Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel. Yaaaay! Awwww!! They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story.. And eat their flesh! B'hut first we should rape them! Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket! This is gonna be fun, huh?  How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant? How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike?  But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket! Hey there.   Hey, what is that?  Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up. Yeah, that's super hardcore. Please, let me go.  Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket. Yes sir!  I... I don't understand why I'm here. I I'm just an actor. Check 1, 2.  We're here. We're s-somewhere. There's lots of... big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and-  Hey, it talks, haha. The little squirrel talks. Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters. There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi. Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH! They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!! They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh! Sir, we have a security breach! Sir, we have a security breach! Maybe Jesus is imaginary too. Sir, we have a security breach! There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two! You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it. They are inside the imagination, sir. There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two! Yeah, but it wouldn't be real. Well then, what about Buddha? There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two! Oh Jesus no!  Awww. Everyone to the main hall now! Go! Everyone to the main hall ''now!!''  The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons!  What imaginary character are you?!  And what imaginary character are you? What's a "Butters"? So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence! You caught the Leprechaun? Take him! That is for the Council of Nine to decide! Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world. Aslan! We're losing the battle! Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control. Its like a... half man half bear! Oh! No, no wait! It's like a half bear half manpig!  Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate. And what say you, Morpheus? Bring him here! I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't. It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.  We prepare for a battle we cannot win.  Only you can help us win this battle. You have a power here that you have yet to understand. Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now! Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.  What are you doing?! We need Santa! BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW! There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW! Then the day is lost. Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield! Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day! Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls! Cavity Creeps?  Project Imagination Doorway?  We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!  The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay! The day is ours!  Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it! What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-? You must believe in Santa! What is that?  How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap. Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.  Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there. You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else. I'm with Jesus. The evil characters aren't going to just let us go. If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge. Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it. Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard. You did it, kid! What? No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker. Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right? Uh okay, now, now hold on, because Superman is here and he wants to say something.  Nice going, kid.  [Says something, but it's unintelligible] Gaw guguh, getskug off of me! Clear!  I'm sorry. He's gone. I'm sorry, young man. Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls. Charging. Clear.  There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?! Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off!  What's going on here?   What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!  Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore. You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here. Whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be.  His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here. Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.  GROUNDED! So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling "Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway." Butters?  Butters! Come on, Butters, time to get up.  You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?! Oh yes you are! That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded!   Come on, kid, imagine Santa! Believe in Santa! Wait! Aslan, look!  What can destroy the Cavity Creeps? Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?! Is nuking our imagination really prudent? Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control? Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the- ...A-ooch That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination! Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO! Uh clearly they don't, Steven, and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters ''are'' real. I cite a famous case of Cartman v. Broflovski in which a U.S. court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun. That's right, Steven, yeah. The Supreme Court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially ''not'' real, and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them. This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case. I-ee got one. I got him.   We're losing the battle! There are simply too many of them! What? What happened? Huh?  Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.  This area is restricted, little boy. Get behind the line with the other protesters!  You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off! No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo!  Stop that nuke! Stop that nuke! Stop that nuke!   We managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves, but... now our troops are being shot down by the Cavity Creeps. Yes!  We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth! Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest!   Missile launch sequence initiated. Missile launch in one minute. Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph. What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven. It's possible that hell is also imaginary. Am I real? Uh so then, we're about to nuke hell... that's a ''good'' thing, right?  Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah. So it'd be all right. Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom. Kyle, this is Superman. I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it. You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you. Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch. Awwww  Are you ready to rock?  Game over! You suck!  You Rock! You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach one million points! Congratulations! You. Are. FAGS.  You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars! Well, I'm impressed.  And I'd like to be your manager. Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points. So, we're in business then?  Well, what do you think?  No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.  Yes! You did it, boys.  All right, nice rehearsal, boys. That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it.   You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.  I think ''you'' could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back. Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.  I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings. You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course.  Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis. That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad?  He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically. Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do.  Pretty damn good, huh? Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history. No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play. Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy? Stan, what is the matter with you? What is this? Are you playing Heroin Hero? No!  Nobody plays Heroin Hero "a little"! You know, you never catch the dragon! You'd better pull your act together because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo! Marsh? Stan, you got-  Get up, Stan! Wake up! You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!  Pull it together, Goddammit! Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom.  Goddamnit, he's a mess!  What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo!  You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you!  I like it. That's these boys playing? That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists? Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here. Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house. Would you boys like to meet him? Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero. You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials? You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks. How are they coming? Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.  Thanks... Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere? That, would be impressive. Sup?  Yup. Sup? Dude, sup. Did you practice last night? No way. I hate that bubblegum crap. Yeah? Well, how about this one? I quit.  I quit, I quit, I quit. I quit, I quit, I quit. Ohoh, I love this song.  Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it? Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress. Have you ever heard of...  Heroin Hero? It's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You ''could'' call it the ultimate first-person shooter.  No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it. There he is! So, did you break a million yet? Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top. Have you played...  Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it. Sssure kid. Sure.  Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on. Catch me. Come on, catch me.  Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on. Hehe, you ''almost'' caught me. They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out.  The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed.  Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now! How come you're playing here now? Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system? Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points! You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this. Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little, and... maybe you can play it for free. Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all. Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways? All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth-grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero.  Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I guess... they're not playing the game anymore.  Fuck you, Bebe! Fuck it, bitch! Ow! What'dja do that for?!   Hurry hurry! Is it set up?  Hey Clyde. Hi Clyde. Hey.  Hey yeah. I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry. Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground! We're not? I know, that song is so awesome.   You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him? Deliberating "Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse"? Millie has the floor. Sunshine sparkle. Wendy has the floor. Why would she do that? Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father owns the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.  Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one! Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!  AAGH! Of course, Stan.  This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again. Which one? We make lists all the time.  Well, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was- Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's not just something we do flippantly! There's protocol!  All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy. If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate. Go ahead. He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion. Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle. It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list.  Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks? I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been- Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Clyde the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one. Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.  You ''knew!'' So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!  No. Not Bebe. When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna- I don't think so!   Stan, run! What? You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity! It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing. Is that a lace across the top?  Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far! It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know. Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way.  Sunshine.  What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding! Sunshine. If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that  Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's. I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest. Is she crazy? Do not burn down the school, Kyle.  I did.  Do you know who I am? I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see.  Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special. Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed. You must be patient.  Very well. Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you. Well then you're just a fucking asshole!  Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today? You just couldn't let it go!  I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy!  Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?! She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her. Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simply generate a new list! "Biggest Liars"! And put you at the top!  He's burning down the school. He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground. That's about far enough!  Give me that list, Wendy!  You can explain all that downtown.
