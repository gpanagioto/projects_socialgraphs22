I can't do this anymore! I can't take it! Nobody ever pays attention to me! Nobody cares! I just want to end it all! Why not?! Everyone would be happier if I did! Everyone. I don't think they'd even notice! You're right, I guess I don't want to quit Twitter. Okay, thanks. Twitter would be better off without me! I'm quitting! What's the point!? Better to just end it all now! I'm gonna do it!  I'm gonna quit Twitter, I mean it this time! They all laugh at me. They won't be laughing when I do it! I'll show them! I swear to God I'm gonna do it this time. Why does it matter? People would be happier if I just did it! I-I talked to my dad. He said, "I don't have the guts to do it!". Well, if I'd quit Twitter, he'd be sorry! I don't know if I'll make it through the night! I just feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, you know, and being chased by hate. And the only way out is to jump! I keep thinking about what the kids at school would do, when they find out I left all my social media. Like they would finally see all the damage they've done.
