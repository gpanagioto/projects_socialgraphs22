==Powers and abilities==
As a being of pure electricity, Zzzax is able to absorb and generate electrical fields, as well as manipulate nearby equipment. It can grow its own [[intelligence]] by draining the energy from human [[Neural oscillation|brainwaves]], thus becoming dependent upon them. While incinerating the victim, it would temporarily take on his or her personality traits. This extends control to their nervous systems via electric currents. Only its foe, the Hulk has proven unaffected by this ability.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol 2 #285 (July 1983)</ref> Zzzax's size and strength increases in direct quality for the electricity it needs to feed.
