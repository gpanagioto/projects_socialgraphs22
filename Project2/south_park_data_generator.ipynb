    "The analysis is based on relationships between the characters, as they are built between the scenes of each episode. To this end, the following actions are required:  \n",
    " - Get the scripts for each episode from each season. The Wiki Fandom website is used.\n",
    " - From each script, get the characters, what they are saying, as well as the scenes, to be used as separators. This is needed because an episode might be consisting of parallel stories, with different character interactions. We want to create relationships between characters that are in the same scenes, not only because they appear in an episode.\n",

    "From the above gathered data, the unique characters list can be built. Moreover, after some formatting for later use, the scripts are also available to be used for sentiment and other text based analysis.  \n",

    "However, this second way uses the full names, as a result further analysis will be required to match the characters to the names in the scripts. As a result, the first method will be used."
