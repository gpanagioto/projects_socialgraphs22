 Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. I've been informed that we are going to be delayed at least another 96 hours. We know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane, but for now you have to stay on this one. Sir, you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened! Yes, but as we all know, Mr. Jackson had a LOT of baggage, and he checked some of that baggage in, so a crew has to go through all the baggage and get his off of purgatory before we can push back from the gate. All right everyone, it looks like we are all ready to move on.  All right, everyone, I'd like to be the first to welcome you to the gates of Hell. Unfortunately, Hell is a tow-in gate.
