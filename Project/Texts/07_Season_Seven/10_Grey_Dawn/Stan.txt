Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive? But they kill people. I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die. What is that? I think so. What is he saying?  Oh! [''drops his hockey stick and holds his hands to his face''] Dad, I'm scared. I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore! Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving. Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa. What's that? The American Association of Retired Persons. Hey Dad. Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them? No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it? All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town.}} The old people have blockades here [''south entrance''] and here [''west entrance'']. The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office. Yeah, I remember hearing about that. All right! We did it!  ...Yeah, ''or'' we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in. Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault! Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it. And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
