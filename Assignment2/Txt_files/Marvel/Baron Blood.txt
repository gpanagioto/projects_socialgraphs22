==Fictional character biography==

===John Falsworth===
'''John Falsworth''' first appears in the title ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' as an [[England|English]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]. Although posing as the son of the first John Falsworth, it is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that the character is in fact the original, made possible due to the fact that he is now an ageless [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]].<ref name="invade7"/> When the family fortune is left to his older brother James, John Falsworth leaves England to pursue an interest of his - vampire lore. Falsworth travels to [[Transylvania]] and encounters the original vampire lord [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], who, after overpowering Falsworth, drains his [[blood]] and turns him into one of the [[undead]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=17–18}}</ref> Dracula then commands Falsworth to return to England and cause havoc in revenge for the deeds of his former opponent [[Jonathan Harker]]. Adopting the alias of "Baron Blood" ({{lang-de|Freiherr Blut}}), the character allies with [[German Empire|Germany]] during [[World War I]] and without either party realizing the identity of the other, battles his own brother, who is now the English hero [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=175}}</ref> Blood is wounded by Jack with a silver dagger, and flees to recover.<ref name="invade7"/>

The character reappears during [[World War II]] in his false persona, and once again aids [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], with [[Nazi]] technology helping him to reduce his susceptibility to [[sunlight]] (a major vampire weakness). As Blood, Falsworth attacks and wounds his niece, Jacqueline Falsworth, but is driven off by the android [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]. Almost dead due to blood loss, Jacqueline Falsworth is saved when given a [[blood transfusion]] by the Torch. The artificial blood causes the character to develop superhuman abilities, and she becomes the heroine [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]]. Blood captures Spitfire and takes her to a cavern below Falsworth Manor, and cripples his brother by breaking his legs with a boulder. Blood is then impaled through the back and chest by a silver-laced stalactite.<ref name="invade7">''The Invaders'' #7-9 (July – October 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Baron Blood reappears when [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese soldiers sent by the [[spy]] [[Lady Lotus]] find the cavern and attempt to [[resurrect]] the character. The soldiers are driven off by Union Jack II (James Falsworth's son, Brian) and Spitfire, although Blood is accidentally revived. Blood travels to the [[United States of America]] and, after a brief skirmish with the Invaders, joins the [[Nazi]] team the [[Super-Axis]] for a final battle with the heroes. Blood is killed once again when impaled on a stake thrown by [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].<ref>''The Invaders'' #39-40 (April – May 1979); #41 (August 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Captain America'' #253-254, a servant of Dracula, Dr. Jacob Cromwell, is sent to revive Blood, whose bones are stored in the [[Tower of London]]. Although Cromwell is successful, Blood betrays and kills him and one of his daughters, turning the other one into a vampire (who later becomes Baroness Blood). Assuming Cromwell's identity, Blood commits a series of murders that arouse the suspicions of his now very elderly brother James. The older Falsworth requests the aid of Captain America, who with [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|the third version]] of [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] battles Blood. After being tricked into thinking that Union Jack III was his older brother James, Blood is [[decapitated]] with [[Captain America's shield]]. The character's body is burned to ashes, with the ashes scattered in the morning breeze.<ref name="auto">''Captain America'' #253-254 (January – February 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Victor Strange===

Given the costume and name of "Baron Blood" by a [[Haitian Vodou#Reception|voodoo]] sorceress, Victor Strange attempts to control his bloodlust and become a costumed [[vigilante]] called "Khiron". He attempts to only prey on criminals,<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #14-18 (February – June 1990)</ref> and when criminals are not available, Victor utilizes his willing girlfriend, Morgana. However, his heroic impulses are used against him; Victor is preyed upon by Cagliostro, an ancient entity that needs vampire blood to live. Victor barely escapes this situation.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' Annual #2 (1992)</ref> The bloodlust, however, forces the character to kill innocents and he eventually commits [[suicide]].<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #56 (August 1993)</ref>

===Kenneth Crichton===
The final version of Baron Blood features in the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Union Jack''.

The character accepts and is turned into a vampire, becoming the third Baron Blood. Baroness Blood then directs Crichton to steal the [[Holy Grail]] from a [[museum]], and uses the [[Magic item|artifact]] to become immune to all vampire weaknesses. The Baroness then betrays Crichton and her vampire servants, leaving them to die when exposed to sunlight.<ref>''Union Jack'' #1-3 (December 1998 – February 1999)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Baron Blood possessed all the powers of a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], including superhuman strength and durability; [[hypnotism]] and the ability to command [[bat]]s; [[Wolf|wolves]]; [[dog]]s; [[rat]]s and [[Mouse|mice]]. Weaknesses included vulnerability to [[sunlight]], [[garlic]], and [[silver]]; the presence of religious symbols; decapitation and a wooden stake through the heart.

Courtesy of Nazi science, Blood received treatment that allowed him activity in sunlight, at least for some length of time, although this also prevented a vampire's traditional shapechanging powers (into a bat or wolf) from working. His transformation into a vampire also somehow activated an apparently latent psionic ability of self-levitation, which enabled Blood to fly without having to change into a bat.
