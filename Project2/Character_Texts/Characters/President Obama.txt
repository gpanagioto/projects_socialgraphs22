I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever.  Yes?  Yes, hello General. Very pleased. Thank you for your help. You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours.   I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation. Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken. Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private? All right. Where are the ballots?  General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not? Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?! I told you China would get the rights to ''Star Wars'' from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure!  it is not secure! 
Now, last week we were all reminded that intolerance still exists in our country. It took a very special young student to light up social media, and we've invited him to the White House today to show our appreciation. Because never have there been more tolerant, more moving words than Kyle Broflovski's speech about his hero Caitlyn Jenner.  Come on up here, Kyle. But wait, there's still more,  Now Kyle, we've got another little surprise for you. We told you we were flying you back home, but the truth is, you're getting a ride back all the way with your hero! How do you like that?!
