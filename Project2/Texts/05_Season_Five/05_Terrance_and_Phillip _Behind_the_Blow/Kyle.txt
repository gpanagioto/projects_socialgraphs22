Okay, dude, it's 3:30.  Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch. Oh my God! Write the number down! Write the number down!! I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning! What?? Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.  Uhuh, but that's why we're going. See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.  Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem! Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat. Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip? We have to talk to Terrance. Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter. Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform. Phillip, your partner. But the guy who replaced him sucks!  But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform. Uuuh, we didn't get them. Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy. Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada. Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side. They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get ''him'' for Earth Day." I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.  Ih-it'll be okay. They said they'd come. He's here!  Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again? Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you? See? I told you it would work.  You can't leave! The show starts soon! You bastards! Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month. Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around! I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy! Haaah!  Wait! dude, LOOK!
