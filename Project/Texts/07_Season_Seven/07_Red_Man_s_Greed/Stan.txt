Wow, dude. Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here.   We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans! We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team! We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars!  We need something that'll get us money tomorrow! Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters! Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars! No! I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle! Look, we- we've got nothing to lose. Dad.  Good luck.  They, they had it! They freakin' had it! You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some. A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!! What??? You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans!   Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!  Come on, you guys! This is our town! We can stay. And fight. Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  No! We won't let you destroy our town! Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life. This land is not for sale. It's all right, dad.  You're gonna be all right. No, Dad, NO. What can I do? Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus! Hey, my name's Stan, and I was- Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS? An inward journey? That sounds kinda gay.  Ah! Oh, dude! Dad! Dad! Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite. Dude, who the hell are you?
