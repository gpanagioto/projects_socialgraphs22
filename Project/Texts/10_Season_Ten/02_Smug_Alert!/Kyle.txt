Dad, let's just go!  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you. We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too...  ...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm...  ...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends. You do?? Righ!  Okay, good. What?? My Dad says he can't live here anymore.  So... what do ''you'' do for fun? Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff. Yeah, fine, Dad. Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid. The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls. Hey Stan. NO! Hybrid cars are a ''good'' thing! Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it. Yeah! Yeah, I guess so. Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass!
