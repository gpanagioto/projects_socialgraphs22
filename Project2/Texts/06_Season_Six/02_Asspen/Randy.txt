Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void. They let you stay for free? Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend! Oh, do we have to do it right now? Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal. So then it's not really ours.  Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now? Wait... All right, look, we've been here for over three hours. No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay. Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are. Well, ''this'' certainly is nice. Oh, God-damnit!  Don't listen to 'em, let's just go! Let's just get out of here.  That does it! I'm calling the police!  All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave! Oh, Jesus. Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
