Dad, can I talk to you? All the girls at school are really mad. It's like, one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us. Everyone's sad, everyone's depressed and nobody knows how to move forward. I guess what I'm saying is, I'm starting to feel a lot of guilt, just for being a boy. How do I not feel that?  Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot and ... we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them. There's a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support. I do. We need to show the girls that not all boys aren't the same and that we are willing to change.  Butters? Butters, you need to calm down. Dude, this is awesome! Did you see how many of the boys I've got to come out tonight?! This is exactly what we needed. Thank god people listen to me. Oh  no! Everyone all right, guys?  Hi, Cartman. I'm so sorry, what we did to you. This Internet troll has everyone going crazy. We shouldn't have assumed it was you. We shouldn't have broke all of your stuff. No! I know it's not cool. I know you're figuring out how to get back at us. What?! You saw who's vagina?  I'm being serious, Cartman. Butters needs to be taken down a notch and you're the best at that.  The, the school is in trouble and, um our friends are...   Cartman, will you just help me mess with Butters to stop his little agroclub from getting any bigger? You know what I mean. Come on! We need the old Cartman back! That's not true at all!
