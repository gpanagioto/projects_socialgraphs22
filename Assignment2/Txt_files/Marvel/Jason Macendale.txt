'''Jason Philip Macendale, Jr.''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The character first appears in ''[[Machine Man]]'' #19 (Feb. 1981), created by writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=168}}</ref>

From 1987 to 1997, Macendale initially wielded only the [[Hobgoblin (Marvel Comics)|Hobgoblin]] identity and weaponry but the 1988-1989 ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' [[Crossover (comics)|crossover]] writer [[Gerry Conway]] had Macendale imbued with demonic powers by [[N'astirh]]. In addition to power over hellfire and increased strength and speed to far greater than the original Hobgoblin, these powers also disfigure Macendale so that his head is even more grotesque than the Hobgoblin mask, and ultimately alters his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal. Macendale eventually succeeds in purging himself of his demonic powers and was later revamped again with cybernetic implants.

The character was killed off in ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #1 in order to make room for [[Roderick Kingsley]] to assume the Hobgoblin mantle. Writer [[Roger Stern]] recounted being initially uncertain of how to resolve the situation of there being two Hobgoblins:

{{quote|When I was preparing to revisit the Hobgoblin, I went over the story that [[Howard Mackie|Howard [Mackie]]] and JR had done in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #68, which was still fairly recent at the time, and I said to the editors, "Wow, they did all this work to revamp the second Hobgoblinâ€”what do you want me to do? I can have Macendale beat my guy [Kingsley], anything you want, because you just went to all this trouble." I heard back and was told that I could open my story by having my guy ''kill'' Macendale. That left things pretty open![emphasis in original]<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|author-link= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #35|page= 21|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==

Jason Macendale was a [[mercenary]] who was recruited out of college and trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and various para-military organizations. Considered a liability due to his violent nature and amoral personality, this rejection turned Macendale to be a mercenary and ultimately a costumed terrorist. He adopted the '''[[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]''' alter ego, engaging in combat with [[Machine Man]] as his first opponent<ref>''Machine Man'' #19</ref> followed by [[Spider-Man]] for the first time.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #56</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=120}}</ref>

Macendale was later hired to retrieve the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]'s lost battle van, pulling off the mission successfully despite Spider-Man's untimely appearance.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #254</ref> When [[Flash Thompson]] insulted the Hobgoblin on national television which had incurred the Hobgoblin's wrath to frame Thompson so that criminal enemies might target Flash instead,<ref name="Unmasked">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = Breeding, Brett | story = Unmasked! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume =  | issue = #276 |date = May 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Macendale subsequently broke Thompson out of jail, thinking he was doing the Hobgoblin a favor. But Macendale ruined the Hobgoblin's plans to operate "under the radar" while Thompson was in custody.<ref name="Clash">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = Breeding, Brett | story = When Warriors Clash--! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume =  | issue = #281 |date = Oct. 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> When the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] temporarily abdicated being the organized crime's head on the eastern seaboard and a resulting [[gang|gang war]] tore [[New York City]] apart, Macendale wished to increase his underworld status and formed an alliance with the Hobgoblin.<ref name="Stand">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Josef]] | story = ...And Who Shall Stand Against Them...? | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume =  | issue = #284 |date = Jan. 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Arranger">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | cowriters = [[Tom DeFalco]] | penciller = [[Alan Kupperberg|Kupperberg, Alan]] | inker = Fern, Jim | story = The Arranger Must Die! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = #1 | issue = #285 |date = Feb. 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The Hobgoblin ultimately double-crossed Macendale when the two were fleeing a horde of police officers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #286</ref> Macendale vowed revenge, ultimately hiring the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] to have the Hobgoblin killed. After his co-conspirator's supposed death, all known copies of Goblin weapons and costumes were handed over to Macendale who took over the '''Hobgoblin''' identity in order to steal notoriety within the supervillain community.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289</ref> However, Macendale was exposed by the Kingpin's organization and fought a battle against Spider-Man which was meant to prove his abilities but was foiled. To add to the embarrassment, Spider-Man was obviously drunk when they fought and still won.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #38</ref>

Deciding he needed abilities like the original Green Goblin and Hobgoblin if he was to have a similar reputation, Macendale attempted to steal the Goblin secret formula for superhuman strength. After failing to do so, he intimated [[Harry Osborn]] by threatening Osborn's [[Liz Allen|loved]] [[Normie Osborn|ones]] for wanting the Goblin formula,<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #47</ref> resulting in a confrontation between himself and the second Green Goblin where Macendale was overcame.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #312</ref> During a [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|demonic invasion of Manhattan]], Macendale felt dejected and humiliated. Offering to sell his [[soul]] in exchange for a demon's power, the demon [[N'astirh]] fused a demon to Macendale.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147</ref> Enhanced by the demon's power but horrified as his handsome face transformed into a demonic one, Macendale blamed his suffering on Spider-Man and Osborn. He hunted Spider-Man down for revenge. With his demonic powers, Macendale defeated Spider-Man easily but [[Mary Jane Watson]] intervened before he could deliver the killing blow.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #48</ref>

Having finally been made into the notorious supervillain he hoped to be at the cost of his humanity, Macendale put his personal enmity for Spider-Man aside and used his demonic powers to be a top contract killer. He offered his mercenary services to [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to eliminate [[Robbie Robertson]] but is stopped by Spider-Man and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161</ref> Macendale next conspired with Carrion to eliminate Spider-Man before his co-conspirator ultimately nearly took both villains out instead.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #162-163</ref> Macendale goes after [[Doctor Strange]] but an illusion spell is cast to try to calm the monstrous man/demon and Macendale sees his true face in reflections of himself.<ref>''Dr. Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #11</ref> Macendale was later stiff-armed by [[Doctor Octopus]] into joining the [[Sinister Six]]'s second incarnation which twice tried to take over the world, failing due to counter measures by Spider-Man, the [[Hulk]], Ghost Rider, the [[Fantastic Four]] and many more heroes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23</ref>

As an independent mercenary and criminal, Macendale would clash with many other heroes, including [[Darkhawk]],<ref>''Darkhawk'' #1-3</ref> and [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]].<ref>''Sleepwalker'' #19-24</ref> However, the insane demon who shared his body acts dominate but gets destabilized long enough for Macendale to briefly regain his sanity during conflicts with Spider-Man and other heroes; once involving [[Moon Knight]],<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #31-33</ref> and twice involving the two Ghost Riders ([[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]).<ref>''Spider-Man'' #6-7</ref><ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #17</ref> Macendale ultimately expelled the demon referred to as the [[Demogoblin]] out of his body. Despite [[Richard Fisk]] want vengeance for [[Ned Leeds]], he has a reluctant partnership with Fisk but later tried to eliminate the Blood Rose and the new Kingpin but is foiled by Spider-Man.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #84-89</ref> In a rare event, Macendale teamed up with Spider-Man to defeat the duo of Demogoblin and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]].<ref>''Spider-Man'' #24, ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #5</ref> Macendale was hired by the Foreigner to assassinate Moon Knight and Nick Katzenberg only to be stopped by Moon Knight and Spider-Man, and turned over to the authorities.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #93-96, ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #6</ref> Macendale obtained [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s strength formula, which enabled him to easily defeat his demonic doppelganger Demogoblin who then died saving a young child in battle.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #47-49</ref>

Macendale was defeated once more by Spider-Man along with [[Coldheart (comics)|Coldheart]] during an attempt to kidnap Macendale's long-lost son. However, Macendale's reunion would be an unhappy one as Macendale attempted (unsuccessfully) to use his son as a hostage to avoid going back to jail. He would remain in jail for some time before being freed by Gaunt, combating against the second [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man]]. In exchange for doing Gaunt's bidding, the scientist turned Macendale into a cyborg such as the removal of Macendale's left eye with a new high-tech cybernetic eye. He failed and was once again arrested.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #68-69</ref>

Considered "just a criminal" by Spider-Man, Macendale was viewed as a typical (sociopathic) thug who is not much of a threat as his predecessor and [[Norman Osborn]] in comparison.<ref name="Legacy of Evil">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek, Kurt]] | penciller = [[Mark Texeira|Texeira, Mark]] | inker = [[Mark Texeira|Texeira, Mark]]| title = Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil | issue = #1 |date = June 1996| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Macendale went on trial for his many crimes and found guilty on several counts (including convictions for the original Hobgoblin's acts), disgustingly responding by revealing that Leeds was his predecessor. His continued testimony leads Spider-Man recounting encounters with the original Hobgoblin, and thus realized that Ned cannot possibly be the supervillain due to lack of powers (despite being killed when Macendale paid the Foreigner).<ref name="Wolverine">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | penciller = [[M.

A later version of [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] (initially misidentified as Macendale) is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; this individual used several false aliases including Jason Macendale, Maguire Beck ([[Mysterio]]'s cousin), and Mad Jack (Daniel Berkhart). Jack O'Lantern's true identity was never revealed but it was not any of the aliases he was using.<ref>{{Cite comic

==Powers and abilities==
Jason Macendale originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the Hobgoblin and the Green Goblin; both his Jack O'Lantern and Hobgoblin personas used a rocket-powered glider, pumpkin bombs, and gauntlet blasters. During the time in which a demon was grafted to him, he had superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as hellfire powers enabling him to create weapons and gliders at will. It is implied that his demonic abilities allowed him to create organic fibers strong enough to bind a normal person.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #6</ref> After acquiring Kraven the Hunter's formula, Macendale had enhanced his strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, and agility to superhuman levels, thanks to anomalies in his blood left over when he and Demogoblin were one, but this formula's effects seemed to have later wore off. His later cybernetically enhanced body thanks to [[Mendel Stromm]] further increased his strength, speed, reflexes, durability, and stamina. Macendale had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry. He often used conventional military weapons. When he adopted the Hobgoblin persona, he was able to make improvements to the Goblin gilder's maneuverability by utilizing skills he gained from his master's degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics. Macendale was also a [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] and a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]], which led to his dishonorable discharge from the military.
