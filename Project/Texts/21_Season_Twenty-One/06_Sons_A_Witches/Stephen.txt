Almost thought you guys were gonna bail on us.  Okay, Chip. You might need to ease up on that crack there, buddy.   Randy, can I talk to you? I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives. I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first. Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming? I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience. Yeah, sure.  I'm sorry. Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about? Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for? What? What uh, What are you doing? Nooo!  Oh my God! I see what this is! This witch pursuit thing has you on a witch pursuit thing now!  I'm innocent. Please! Noho, don't you see?! They're just doing their own witch pursuit thingy now! This is madness!  "What's up, bros?" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused?
