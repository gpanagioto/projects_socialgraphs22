Mom, ''please'' can we just leave? But I ''hate'' the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat. That's what I ''told'' him, but he doesn't listen to ''reason''.   Hi, Doctor Lout.  Ey! Don't call me a little piggy! I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!  God damn it! Yes. I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! ''Mom!'' Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian! They look exactly the same. I don't know, two! Uh, one.  Two. Ow! I hate you!  Hey dudes. My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated. Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it! Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do. Hey, yeah!  Ow!  Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy. Can I have the yellow with a ''side'' of white? I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny.   Ow! My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean. Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a ''bitch'' she is. Bitch, I hate that bitch!  Stop calling me piggy! So, what does that mean?  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!  Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me. I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave! Ow! Son of a bitch! Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha! I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.  Uh, yeah, sure sure. Ey! Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses. Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef! Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind? Oh, no! Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow. But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus! Hey! You son of a bitch! Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days! Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus? Okay.  Aaah! It's the succubus!  What? What happened? You guys, it's six in the morning, I ''have'' to get some sleep. You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep.   What what what? I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard! Okay.  Ow!  Oh no! The tape jammed!   I can't see anything!  What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay? After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again! No, not with ''my'' eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Eh-sure.
