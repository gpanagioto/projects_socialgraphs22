  Oho, Randy, it's beautiful! Randy, are you being serious?  I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money. I didn't say anything. Ya think?  I think that's good. Feel tight enough? Let's see the shield.  Yehay! Stan's about to go out with his friends. For what?! Randy, let him go trick-or-treating. Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  Can I help you with something?  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.  I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower? You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen? You want me to bring you some McDonald's? What do you want from McDonald's?
