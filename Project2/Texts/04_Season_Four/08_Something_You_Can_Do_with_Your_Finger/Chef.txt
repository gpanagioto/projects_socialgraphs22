 Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric. Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out.   Alright, Eric, what's the matter? Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect. The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming." All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  You're welcome. Now, go away! A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
