I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.  So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday?  Is it really as bad as they say it is?  Please to put a penny in the old man's-  Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash. I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.  Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want! Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Morning, Joe, Marcus. What is it? Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both. Whoa! Haha.  Yes sir! No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh. You-d, you do?  Yeah... awesome... Alright, listen up.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God! No!  No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you! No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
