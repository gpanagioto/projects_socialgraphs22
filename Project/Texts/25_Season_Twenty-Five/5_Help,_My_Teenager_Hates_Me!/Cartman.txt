Right here! Alright, sweet! Me and Kenny and our teenagers are gonna smoke you guys! Yes! Yes! Yes!! You didn't get me! You didn't hit me, Kyle! The BBs bounced off a leaf or something, 'cause–   Oh, my God… this is the greatest day of my fucking life. Yes! Yes!! That was so awesome!! You guys, Airsoft fucking rules! This is–  Ow! Hit! Hit! This is sweet! Best thing ever! Yeah, well, Team Floppy Weiner will get you guys next time!  Can we promise each other we'll do Airsoft, like, all the time?  Dude, Swamp Sniper rules.  What– What are you doing, dude? You– You need to use my bathroom?  Kyle? What are you doing here? Well, at least I'm not the only one dealing with this crap. No, my teenager wants more lotion.  All this guy does is hang out in the bathroom and go through like two bottles of lotion a day. I swear I don't know how soft you could possibly want your hands to be.  Damn right! Team Floppy Weiner will destroy you guys! You have to find me first! Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me! There's one over by the registers. No, you are not taking the lotion!  Okay, I'm sorry you hate me. Just wanna fucking play Airsoft, buddy. On the rare occasion that my teenager isn't in the bathroom, all he does is talk about his miserable life. I'm like—okay, dude, I've got problems too. But of course teenagers don't care about your problems. I'm like, "look, buddy, I live in a hot dog. Ok? Like, maybe let's stop bitching and just play Airsoft." But you can't say that because then they're just gonna— Yes, yes.  Camping?  Okay, looks like the tents are set up—can you come out now? Okay, well, you should probably finish up. I know you took the lotion in there. You really don't need soft hands for camping.  Come on, dude. No shit in the world takes that long. Up to here! Guys, things have to improve. They just have to. I've never seen anyone so disrespectful. I've never seen Kenny like this, ever. That's awesome. I wish I had a dad. And that I didn't live in a hot dog. I know where he is…  What you do to Jegens Lotion isn't right.   Aaaagh! Yes… yes, I live in a hot dog! It's right over here! Come on, you guys, help me get it all ready!
