Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller!  Your father is in grave danger. Come with me!  Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before! Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's ''first'' award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960. So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? ''Because he is crap.'' Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...  Yes.
