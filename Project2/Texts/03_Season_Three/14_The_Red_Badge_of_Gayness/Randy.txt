 Alright men, fire!  Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down. Yeh-hah!  He took the bell!  Ow! That hurt!  Oh? Jimbo, have you lost your mind?! Alright, alright. We surrender.  Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.  All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka! Huh? Well, the Union be damned!  Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?! WHERE?!  Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!  We're out of s'more schnapps?  Oh, my head. Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us. Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here. Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff. Ey, that sounds fun.  What was that??  A whole year?
