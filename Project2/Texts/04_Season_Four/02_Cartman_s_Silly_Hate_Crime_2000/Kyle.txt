Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move. Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?!  We killed Kenny? Well, that didn't work. What else can we try? If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was. How? Sweet! Let's go!  Hey, fatass. How's prison? Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.

Why not? I don't start, you start. And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday. He's gotta show up. He's just ''got'' to. Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him. On the sled, fatass! Go, fatass! Oh no! The girls are gonna win! We won! We won! It's good to have you back, Cartman.
