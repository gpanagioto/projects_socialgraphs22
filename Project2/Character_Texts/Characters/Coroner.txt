Toxicology reports show subject had massive amounts of opioids in system at time of death. Now proceeding.  Have these put in the garbage. Who is this? Nothing out of the ordinary. The subject died of a simple overdose. We found nothing else except for two Hummmels in the subject's rectal cavity. Not at all. We found Hummels in nearly all the birthday entertainers' anal cavities. It's very common in our overdose victims.
