'''Baron Karl Amadeus Mordo''' (known as '''Baron Mordo''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].  The character is depicted commonly as an adversary of [[Doctor Strange]]. The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], and first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #111 (Aug. 1963). Baron Mordo is a gifted [[Magic in fiction|magician]], especially adept in the black arts of magic, including summoning demons.

Karl Mordo was studying the magic arts under the [[Ancient One]] in Tibet when Dr. Stephen Strange arrived.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], Baron Mordo first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #111 (Aug. 1963).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=42}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
A [[Transylvania]]n nobleman (born in Varf Mandra), Karl Amadeus Mordo became a student of the [[Tibet]]an [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] known as the [[Ancient One]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115 (Dec. 1963)</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=93}}</ref> When Mordo plotted to kill his teacher, Dr. Stephen Strange learned of the plot. Mordo was forced to cast restraining spells to prevent Strange from warning the Ancient One. In desperation, Strange decided to accept the Ancient One's offer to take him on as his mentor in [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]] to have some hope of stopping Mordo. The Ancient One, however, was fully aware of Mordo's plot and of Strange's desire to warn him. Pleased at Strange's unselfish decision, the Ancient One's [[Magic (supernatural)|magical teachings]] immediately freed the doctor and explained the full situation. Thus informed in the face of his recent experiences, Strange agreed to become the Ancient One's apprentice despite the requirement that he abandon his former life. The Ancient One trained him to be a formidable opponent of Mordo. Eventually Mordo was exiled by the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #111. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mordo's abilities were similar to those of Doctor Strange, but Mordo was particularly skilled at [[astral projection]] and [[hypnosis]], as well as [[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]]. He was more than willing to use powerful [[black magic]] and invoke demons, both of which Strange was reluctant or unable to do. Mordo's use of these darker arts would sometimes backfire.

The evil Mordo became an open foe of Doctor Strange. He sent his [[Astral projection|astral form]] to hypnotize the Ancient One's servant into poisoning his food, hoping the old man would reveal his secrets of magic. However, Strange tricked him into returning to his physical body after engaging in astral contact with him, thus breaking his hold over the servant, who helped the Ancient One to recover. Mordo disguised himself as Sir Clive Bentley, and trapped Doctor Strange with a drugged candle that paralyzed him, but Strange was able to use his mental powers to call a local girl to free him.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #114. Marvel Comics.</ref> He opposed Doctor Strange's discipleship to the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref> He set a series of new traps for Strange in a bid to wrest magical secrets from the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #117. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mordo took Strange's body while Strange was astral projecting for a threat he sensed that Mordo had caused, and cast a barrier around it, knowing that if his astral form was out for 24 hours it would die. Strange found it in a [[wax museum]], but was unable to enter. However, Strange took control of a wax model in the last minute, distracting Mordo and enabling Strange to return to his body.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #121. Marvel Comics.</ref> He imprisoned the Ancient One, but was again defeated.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #125. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mordo made a deal with his new master, the demonic [[Dormammu]] of the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], to amass additional power to defeat Doctor Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #130.

Marvel Comics.</ref> He attacked Strange, and escaped into the 1940s, but was manipulated by Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #49-50. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mordo later sold his soul to both [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]] for power, gaming that Strange would save him.

==Powers and abilities==
Baron Mordo has vast magical abilities derived from his years of studying black magic and the mystic arts. He can manipulate magical forces for a variety of effects, including hypnotism, mesmerism, thought-casting, and illusion casting. He can separate his astral form from his body, allowing him to become intangible and invisible to most beings. He can project deadly force blasts using magic, can teleport inter-dimensionally, and can manipulate many forms of magical energy. He can tap extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. He can also summon demons, but often does not have enough power to force them to do what he wants them to do.

Baron Mordo has some knowledge of a karate-like martial art form, and has an extensive knowledge of magical lore.
