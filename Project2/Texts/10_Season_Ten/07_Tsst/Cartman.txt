I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole. Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg. Well he called me chubby! Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry! Sure you do. You're a great mom.<br />''Who's got the greatest mom in the world?<br />I dooo.<br />My mom is number one in my heart.<br />It's true!''   Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door! Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now.  Mom, I want a Twinkie.  Ha! Hahahahahaha!  No thanks, I'd rather naught. The hell do you think you're doing? Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch! Time out?  And what exactly keeps me on the stool?  Ummm, no? All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now. I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move. ''[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.'' Because you took my Xbox. Well, yeah. Yeah. I guess so. Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny. Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy? Why not? You're sterile, is that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless. Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile!  You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake. Not interested in me? Yeah, well I don't see why- Hey! Mom, this guy doesn't- Ah! Quit it! Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can- KNOCK IT OFF! I'm not fat! Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch? Mom, this is degrading! Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh!  Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm. Mom, seriously, people are seeing me! Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now? Mom!  God dammit stop ignoring me! This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention! Quit it, mom! Ooo, Colonel? Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken. Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken! Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please? Suck my asshole, taco vendor! Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over! You can't do that to me, I- Goddamnit, you just can't- Seriously! Ey? Eh...   I hate you! I'm running away! Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow. Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street! All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you. Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man. Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now. You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets. ...Should that really matter at a time like this? This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her. All right, I'm back. Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here. That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat. Aw, Goddammit! What is he still doing here?! What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz! Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services!  Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you! I am your son, and you ''will listen'' to me! You have no right to- Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th- Seriously! Mom- Seriously! Why are you... doing this-? Mom?! Mom? Mom... Who does she think she is, telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me? Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom. She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes. Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out. She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom. Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face. Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?! Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face. Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself! You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.   No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want! She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being. Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes ''are'' good for me. Maybe...  Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham. Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started. Tha... thank you? 'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez.  I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now.  No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then. Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
