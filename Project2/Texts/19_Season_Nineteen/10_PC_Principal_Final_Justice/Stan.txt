Alright Kyle, what's this about? How do you know all this? Kyle!  What? Dad, where were you last night? Work on what? Principal Victoria?  Mr. Garrison? Caitlyn Jenner? Tell me what's going on, Dad?  No! I wanna know what the hell is going on right now! Kyle said I couldn't trust you! What are you planning, Dad? Then what is it?! I'm gonna go tell Mom!  Mom! Because you wouldn't talk to me, Dad!  She doesn't always take my side! We all need to be better to each other!   We just wanna know what's going on with you. Wait... That's Leslie.  Oh my God... It's Kyle. Kyle has been protecting Leslie. They're together. He's been making everyone feel paranoid and saying you're the enemy, Dad. Yeah! Fuck you, Kyle! You're the enemy! So now we know who got Principal Victoria fired! This is going to be really hard.
