Halloween has always been a time of evil and darkness. But now it appears that Satan will literally be among us. He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles, and from what we understand, the gathering is going to be... completely off the hook.  Yes, hello? It this the fire department?  Damn your evil heart, Satan!! The Fire Marshal is at the party! Satan invited him! That's it! One way or another, we're crashing this party! In the name of Christ, just let us in!
