Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef. Thank you, Chef! And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!
