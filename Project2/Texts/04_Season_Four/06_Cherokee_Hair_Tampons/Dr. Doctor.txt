Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley. How can I help you? He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine. Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die. I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn. That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact,  there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle. Why, hello there, Eric.  Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it? Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery.  Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release.
