Well, I went to the video game store and I bought this.  ''Jedi: Fallen Order''. It's getting great reviews. Thought you might want it. Great. Could you do just one little thing for me, Kyle? When you get back home, could you find a way to get a little of your mom's poop, and put it in this jar?  I don't need much. I'm sure you can find a way to sneak it from her. You do that and the game is all yours. Oh well, think about it. The offer stands. I heard you can customize your own lightsaber.  [dressed in a tennis outfit, turns around] Oh, hi girls. What's new? Fecal transplant. It's true what they say: I feel 20 years younger. [swings her tennis racket around] Fecal transplant, Damon. Keep your eyes in the road! Oh. Hey, Sheila. [smiles] Yeah, I had a little procedure done. Fecal transplant. No, I... did it myself. With a turkey baster. Well, it's really none of your business, Sheila. It's a private matter, a fecal transplant. I'd really rather not talk about it. See you girls! [walks off] There you are, you Goddamned bitch! I will take you to court, fat whore! You knew I was gonna steal your poo, and so you tainted it, didn't you?! I have been shitting and throwing up all day! It has to be from your feces! That's besides the point now! Oh, you're all backstabbing bitches now?! Just admit it! I can't stop puking and shitting because of what you did to me! What the fuck?! Oh, Sheila, I'm so sorry for stealing your feces.
