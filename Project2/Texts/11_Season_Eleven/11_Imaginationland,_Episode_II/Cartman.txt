  (echoing) Aaaaahhhh... NO! I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time. Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?! Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!  Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?! That kid you have made a bet that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!  validated by the United States court system! Theee conference room is which way?  Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you. Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls. Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.   extra vinegary... I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think? No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth? In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually-  Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet. No! Goddammit, no! No! Kyle can't die.  Kyle?  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!  Do it! DO IT!  Come on buddy. Come on buddy.  Wake up, Kyle.
