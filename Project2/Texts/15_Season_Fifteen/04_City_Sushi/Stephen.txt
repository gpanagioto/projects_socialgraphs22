That's my son. Is there a problem, officer? What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded! Don't talk back to me!  Go up to your room, now!  Butters started an Asian turf war! I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda. Well, Dr. Janus? Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him? Oh God the medication isn't working! Butters! Butters!!  '''''Butterrrrs!!!''''' You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you, son! You're going to be okay, Butters! You hear me?! '''''You are going to be okay!!!'''''
