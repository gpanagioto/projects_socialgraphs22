 Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?  Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen. Huh? How do you know that? George Bush? Terrorists? Communists? Chinese radicals? ...Cartman?  Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!  Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now. Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside. How? We can't get out! The flames are too big!  Dude, this whole building is going to collapse! Oh Jesus, we have to hurry! What are you doing? What gold?? No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about! Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around! Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die! Goddamnit, you ''know'' I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?! ...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!
