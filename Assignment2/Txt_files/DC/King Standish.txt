==Fictional character biography==
Wealthy, sophisticated King Standish was a master of disguise who wanted to stop crime.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=The King |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/theking.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref> He was considered a criminal by both the police and the underworld, but he was a crime-fighter. He used hand-to-hand combat and occasionally guns. Over time, his reputation improved. King Standish always remained in disguise, allowing no one to know what he looked like. His actual face and name are never revealed. He wore a [[tuxedo]], an opera cape, a [[top hat]] and a [[domino mask]], whenever making an appearance not in disguise.<ref name="Commic Vine">{{cite web |title=The King |url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-king/4005-61635/ |website=[[Comic Vine]] |access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

His most frequent adversary was the Witch, who rivaled his ability to disguise himself. He finally convinced her to switch sides, and help him in his fight against crime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |pages=150â€“151}}</ref>
