==Fictional character biography==
Antoine Desloin is the [[lead singer]] of the Mercy Killers, going by the name of Hypno-Hustler. He and his band were scheduled to perform at a nightclub called "Beyond Forever". When the club's manager catches Hypno-Hustler robbing his safe, Hypno-Hustler used his hypnotic equipment on the manager. When it came time to perform, Hypno-Hustler and his band used their hypnotizing equipment on the audience in a plan to rob them as well. Peter Parker was at the club at the time and changed into [[Spider-Man]]. During the fight, Spider-Man discovered that Hypno-Hustler's headphones protected him from his own hypnotic music. Spider-Man managed to remove them from Hypno-Hustler causing him to become a victim of his own hypnosis. When the audience was free of the hypnosis, Hypno-Hustler and his Mercy Killers were webbed up and left for the police.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>
