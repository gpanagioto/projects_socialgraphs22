Attention all units in the vicinity of South Park Elementary!  Principal calling for help during school assembly! All officers needed at once!   Oh, is that so? Well, we'd like to come help you, but we don't wanna get fired. I see. And are any of these homeless people of a minority persuasion? Oh, it matters. See, it used be we could beat up minorities and nobody cared. It's the reason a lot of us joined the force.  Hey Mitch, you wanna go down and arrest some homeless people but not be able to beat up any minorities? Yeah, no, I think we're good. In fact, we're thinking of maybe turning the whole department into a hula school. Whattaya think? What? What's that, you say? Jeez, I'm sorry. We've got to work on our koholo kaloa, and get the lomi lomi chicken ready for the big ho'olao le'ao, which leaves us... oh, not enough time to deal with ISIS. Hey, who was it that said "fuck the police"? Was that Ice Cube? Tupac? Oh, right, that was you guys! Sorry, but I guess you'll have to find somebody else to do all the difficult dirty shit you don't want to do yourselves. I've gotta be ready for the luau. I might even kiss a dude. Oh no? I'm a cop. We've got a deal, right? Alright you, come on!
