We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys!  Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein. Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons. Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull. Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven! Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs. So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!
