Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma. Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?!  God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering! Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up.   Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.  Arkansas? Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second? Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.  ...father still lives there. I haven't seen my father for 23 years. ...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me. Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—  Aaaaaah!   Hello. Dad. Can I ...come in? No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did. I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things. Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it!  I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad! I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this! I know! I wanna know why not?! Was it that I was ugly?! I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?! Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy!  Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about.  Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me? He never did, Mom, not once.  He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did! You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep! Face it, Mother. He never abused me!  Mother won't hear the truth! You can't close your eyes forever, Mother!  Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.  Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.  Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something.  Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.  Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers. You don't love me!  I wanna die!   Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!  Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon. No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have. We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to. I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! ''[turns and heads cheerfully out the door] Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...'' Oh, no. What are they doing? Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus.  Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G. M-m-m.  Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home. Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning.
