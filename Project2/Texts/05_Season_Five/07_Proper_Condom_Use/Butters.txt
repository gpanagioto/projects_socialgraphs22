Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas. Uh what are we gonna do, huh? Ha-I'll be nine next week. Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day? Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes" How the heck should I know?  Hoh- it's all gooey. Ha-a how come I gotta go first? Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky. I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see.  But it won't ''stay'' on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on. ...Pretty good. Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.  Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am ''I'' supposed to say?  Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
