'''Quasar''' is the name of several [[fiction]]al [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. They are noted for having worn the Quantum Bands, advanced ancient alien technology that grants the wearer awesome power.

==Fictional character biography==

===Wendell Vaughn===
{{main|Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)}}
Vaughn is the longest-running Quasar character, and the first to use the name.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=242}}</ref>

===Phyla-Vell===
{{main|Phyla-Vell}}
Phyla-Vell becomes Quasar for a time after taking the Quantum Bands from Annihilus.

===Richard Rider===
{{main|Nova (Richard Rider)}}
To keep him from dying while deprived of the Nova Force, Rider temporarily takes the Quantum Bands from Vaughn, thus becoming Quasar.

===Avril Kincaid===
Avril Kincaid is a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent who debuted during the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline. While working at Pleasant Hill, a gated community holding super villains brainwashed by Kobik, Avril runs a daycare center as her cover. When [[Baron Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] and [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] regain their memories and start a riot, Kincaid is attacked by the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]], but is saved by [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]]. After Captain America shuts down the security system at the Pleasant Hill Museum, Kincaid enters it and encounters the curator, a retired Wendell Vaughn.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7</ref> As part of a contingency plan for if S.H.I.E.L.D. ever lost control of Kobik, Vaughn gives the Quantum Bands to Kincaid. In the aftermath of the events that transpired at Pleasant Hill, Kincaid becomes the new Quasar with Vaughn acting as her mentor.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1</ref> She is later revealed to be gay.

She is later seen trying to prevent an attack by the [[Chitauri]], but is apparently killed in action. Her apparent death leads the United States government to give Captain America control of the military and law enforcement, as [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] also assumes control of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]].<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0</ref> It is later revealed that Kincaid is in a comatose state.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #3</ref> When she awakens, she destroys the planetary shield that the Hydra Steve Rogers has been using to keep some of Earth's most powerful heroes off-planet.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #8</ref> However, this act seemingly costs Avril her life, with [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] stating that Avril died after bringing down the shield.<ref>''The Mighty Captain Marvel'' #8</ref>

After Avril's apparent demise, Wendell Vaughn reassumes the Quasar mantle. However, after becoming trapped in a black hole, Vaughn catches a glimpse of Avril, who is still alive, but lost somewhere in space.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy Annual'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

[[File:Annihilation Nova 3 art.jpg|thumb|left|Quantum Bands used in the promotional art for ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]: [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' #3 (Aug. 2006), by [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]]]]

The Quasars' powers are derived from the pair of Quantum Bands fused to the bearer's wrists (or more specifically, from the seven gems on each of the bands). The bands are permanently affixed to the wrists; while he or she can make light bend around them so they appear to be invisible, they are still tangible. They are linked to their wearer's nervous system and grant tremendous powers of energy manipulation, apparently working the same for each bearer. Composed of unknown materials, the bands were originally created by Eon to be worn by his designated Protector of the Universe.{{issue|date=June 2018}} At some point they were left in a weapons depot by the alien [[Kree]], where they were discovered by the [[Uranian (comics)|Uranian]] [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]] and brought to Earth by the deluded Crusader, who believed himself to be the 1950s Marvel Boy.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

Foremost among the bands' powers is the ability to tap into a limitless energy source called the "Quantum Zone". Quasars can project [[quantum]] energy in the form of devastating beams of force or heat. Vaughn more commonly employs them to fashion incredibly durable constructs of solid energy, such as containment spheres or pincers. He protects himself with a personal force field of quantum energy.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

The Quantum Bands can also exert control over many other types of energy that are part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. For example, Vaughn once caused a star to emit an enormous solar flare.{{issue|date=June 2018}} It is also possible to absorb and redirect the cosmic energy wielded by such powerful beings as the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]], [[Adam Warlock]], [[Thanos]], [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Jean Grey]] and the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], siphoning their power and using it to augment the quantum energy.{{issue|date=June 2018}} Forms of energy the Quantum Bands cannot control include magic and the [[Darkforce]].{{issue|date=June 2018}}

Although the bands apparently cannot overtly affect [[psionic]] energy, Vaughn has programmed them to render him impervious to psionic mental control. Even such powerful psychics as [[Moondragon]] and the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] have proven unable to overcome this defense. This does not protect the bearer from magical forms of compulsion.<ref>Thor #437</ref>

It is possible to create apertures into and out of the Quantum Zone, thus allowing passage through its infinite, featureless expanse. Vaughn mainly uses this ability to traverse interstellar distances in a manner similar to [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] travel, which he refers to as a "Quantum Jump". A Quantum Jump has a destructive side effect on the local environment, violently upheaving gravity and tearing holes in the atmosphere (on Earth, it would damage the [[ozone layer]]). Vaughn initially refrains from using this ability except when in space or in dire circumstances, but eventually discovers that he can prevent this effect by surrounding himself with a barrier of solid energy before jumping.{{issue|date=June 2018}} It is also possible to shunt matter into the Quantum Zone, provided that the Quasar is in physical contact with it.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

The Quantum Bands enable their wearer to fly by manipulating [[gravitons]]. The maximum obtainable flight speed is unknown, but Vaughn once made a trip from Earth to [[Uranus]] in approximately four years flying non-stop (this was before he learned how to quantum jump). That would require a constant speed of roughly {{convert|50000|mi/h|km/h}}. This doesn't take into account the velocity that can be achieved in a short burst of acceleration.

The Quantum Bands' gems possess some capability to analyze and process information as if they were extremely advanced computers. This makes it possible to navigate the Quantum Zone and the depths of space. The gems are able to detect, analyze, and track energy emissions across vast distances. They can also "program" Quasars' quantum energy to register and react to certain preset conditions. For instance, at one time Vaughn had the Earth surrounded with an invisible lattice-work of energy that was designed to act as a global alert system against potential [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] threats. The energy field could detect any surges of exotic energy emanating from the planet's surface and any object larger than a [[micrometeorite]] passing through it; in either case, the field would react by transmitting an alert signal to the Quantum Bands.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

Vaughn has had a direct link to Eon and later [[Epoch (Marvel comics)|Epoch]] through the bands, which provides ready access to their omniscience.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

Phyla-Vell discovers that the bands contain a finite amount of energy which will drain away if they are isolated from their power source (as yet unexplained) and that they also remain linked in some way to their former users.<ref>''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar''</ref>
