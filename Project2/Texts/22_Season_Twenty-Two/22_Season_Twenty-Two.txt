I want you all to take a close look at your math exams, children. Some of you did very well, but many of you did not.    And what about the four's? Tolkien? Ah, I can't hear you, Eric. And now we divide, right?! Craig, how about you?! What are we dividing?! The four by the six?! Or the six by the four?! Now we're gonna retake the exam on Friday. Now I'm giving you an opportunity to do better. I hope you take advantage of it. Eric, that's enough! ["Shooter is down, shooter is down"] Now let's move on to the next equation. The quiz is multiple-choice, but be sure to show all your work. You'll have 20 minutes to complete your answers. All right, your time starts... now.    What do you think you're doing? Oh, man! Wait, wait, Tolkien got an A? But I cheated off Tolkien! I said something's wrong! I got an F, but I cheated off Tolkien! You can see where Tolkien erased his answers and wrote down the right ones! He did it to me on purpose!  That is such bullshit, you guys! Tolkien knew I was cheating off him, so he deliberately put down the wrong answers! Why would he do that?! That's not the point, you guys! Why is Tolkien out to get me? There's something going on here. But why now? That's the question, Kyle. I always cheat off Tolkien. Why did he choose now to hurt me? Dude, what's up Stan's mom's ass? Tolkien,  There are some terrible things that I realize you might have heard from the other kids here at school. There are some rumors that have been going around, about me, that... that I thought Black Panther was a terrible movie. There's rumors that I said it was a structural mess. You know, that the rhinos were really stupid. I want to assure you that I never said anything like that. I loved Black Panther. So if, you know, you feel like there's a need to come after me, to get back at me, I just need you to know that people are lying, because I like Black Panther just as much as you did. I am not a racist.  Say what, girlfriend? Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis? Come on, Raj! You never saw Black Panther?? But I thought all of you saw it.  Tolkien, let's be honest with each other, okay? Why else would you manipulate my test grades? There was a test. I should have got an A on it, but Tolkien did things to make me fail, and it's not fair. You didn't make me fail the test and you didn't see Black Panther. Right. I mean, I mean, this is ridiculous.  Butters, I need help. My mom says if I flunk another math test, she's gonna ground me from playing Fortnite. No, dumbass, I need to get some dirt on Tolkien so he stops punishing me for what I supposedly said about Black Panther. No it wasn't. But now listen.  There's got to be something Tolkien wouldn't want people to know. Something I can use as leverage. Just ask around. If you find any dirt on Tolkien, give me a call.   Word on the street is you and Tolkien are back together. Why did you break up with him? What did he do to you?  He didn't take you to see Black Panther with him, did he? That must have really stung. Oh no? When you guys talk about how sweet Black Panther was, what's he say? Right. You two guys just hang out and talk, and Black Panther never comes up. Why are you covering for Tolkien? What's he have on you?  Hello, Mom and Dad. Yeah. yeah yeah, I know. You know, my other favorite part was when Black Panther had those dreams about his dead father. I mean the dad, the tribal leader, speaking to the new king about being a good leader. I've never seen a movie do that before, except for Lion King, of course, but Black Panther was so original. So, uh, what was Tolkien's favorite part of Black Panther? Yeah. You must have all had some deep family talks about it. What does Tolkien say about it on Black Panther Family Discussion Night?  Tolkien. Sure thing. You know, we were just talking about how your family did see Black Panther. Well, I guess there's nothing more to it, then. Nice talking to you folks.  Eh, you know, just one last thing. If you ever found out your son saw a PG-13 movie without you, you'd probably be pretty pissed off. No. No, he'd have no reason to falsely claim he's the only one who hasn't seen Black Panther.  I'll see you at school. Oh hay, man. The big math quiz is about to start. You gonna let me cheat off you? You saw Black Panther without your parents' permission. I typed up all my findings, Tolkien. I made ten copies and put them in envelopes. If I don't pass this math quiz, the envelopes are all set to be sent to ten different news organizations. So, what's it gonna be, Tolkien? You can be mad I didn't like Black Panther, but you can't take it out on me anymore. Then I guess your parents won't be mad when they read my report. In poker they call it a bluff. I know that right now, Tolkien is shitting his pants. All I need to do now is wait for the poop to stink. Tolkien, we are running out of time. If you don't let me cheat off you, I'm going to tell your parents that you saw Black Panther in the theater without them! Of course you did, Tolkien! That's why me ripping on it pissed you off so much! But Tolkien, I don't understand! If you didn't see it, and you really don't care that I ripped on Black Panther, then why would you let me cheat-  That's what this is all about, isn't it? You hate yourself for seeing through the mirage like I did, and that's why you wouldn't let me cheat off you! Well I didn't write Black Panther, Tolkien! It isn't my fault it sucked! Why go after me?! But now, it's over. Don't worry. They're not gonna know you didn't like Black Panther, so long as... you never make me fail another math test. What? No!  Come on! We can still get to class on time!  Butters! Butters, I have to get to class! The math quiz is starting! I can't flunk this math quiz, Butters! Cover me!  Everybody has dirty laundry. All it takes to find it is getting a little dirty yourself. The only question now is, how many Tolkiens are out there? How many others are afraid to say that Black Panther wasn't all that sweet because of the damage it could do to them? What do you mean?  There are others out there... and even if it means failing, I'm their only damn hope. I wanna be Calamity Jane this time. Let's see what you got, bitch. Ace. You lose.  Ugh.  Why did you invite Butters to game night?  It's all right, Clyde, it's all right.  Kyle! Yeah, but he left with Butters. Yeah, it's not even Halloween yet. Dude! Look!  Not getting that stink on me. Yeah. You know everyone in town thinks he's a piece of shit. Mm, let's see how that goes for you in 2018.  Uh huh! 2018.  Well, your little brother does it too, Kyle. You didn't know? The Kindergartners are like the biggest vapers at this school.   Butters! I had to! Butters, next time when Kyle walks up to you and says "Are you selling vape stuff," you say "No, I am not, Kyle." Butters. we have to be extra-cautious right now, or else we're -- hang on, hang on --   We can't start getting sloppy now. Do you understand? Everything will make sense, Butters. I told you.  Oh, hey Kyle. What are you up to?  Okay, cool, but come check this out. This is really cool. Just come- no, just come see.  This is really cool.  You know, Kyle, people all need a way to relax. And there's no proof that vaping is that bad for you. Kindergartners need a break too, Kyle! Would you rather the kindergartners smoke cigarettes?  Just please listen, all right? The truth is... we want out. Butters and I thought we could just make some easy money, but you gotta pay off the 6th graders, then you gotta pay off the recess monitor to look the other way. We're in deep, Kyle. Just let us see enough to get out of debt, and we will stop. I swear it. Come on, Kyle, we all make mistakes. Did you already forget last week? You know... Ronan Farrow was here asking about you. Yes, Kyle! He was right over there! Just please,  give us two days to make back the money we need to get out from under this. and we will stop. You have my word. Okay, I'll focus my marketing on another direction. Thank you, Kyle.   Man, am I feeling tired! All this hard work at school?   Hey guys! It's the Vaping Man! What are you doing here, Vaping Man? Vaping? Hey, that's bad for you. Vaping's only for cool kids. Sure, Kyle. What is this about? Well of course.  How is this pushing it on little kids, Kyle? It's marketing! Kyle, we have to make the money to pay off our dealer. How else are we supposed to do it? Why?  That's him. That's my guy.  Whoa, hey dude! Why is there a dead hooker next to you? Dude, that is a dead hooker. What are you doing with it?! I'm calling the cops!   There's a dead hooker at the vape store! Get the vaporizers, and the cash! Get the cash, Kyle! Just get the- Oh shit! Ronan Farrow! Get the stuff and the cash! Ronan Farrow, Kyle! We've gotta get out of here!   Oh, hi Kyle. We were just talking to the counselor about some college opportunities. What are you doing here? Okay, well, we really should talk first, Kyle. Kyle, things have changed. You need to listen. Kyle, listen! You want to hear this! You need to hear this! We'lll be right back, Mr. Mackey.  Kyle, listen. It's bad. The guy we tried to frame at the vape shop. He was the one the sixth graders got their shit from. The sixth graders are pissed at us, Kyle! We have to break into the vape shop and steal enough stuff to make the sixth graders happy. Yeah, but the sixth graders know you were there! Aah! Kyle, what are you doing? Kyle? Nononononono. Okay, Kyle, I'm calling Ronan Farrow.  Hello, Ronan? Eric Cartman. Yeah, hey. So you know Kyle? Yeah, well, you're right about him. Yeah, I think they just work with your cell phone. Kewl! Do you wanna use your mom's or my mom's? 3715 ... 523 ... Yeah, you want a visa? 8292 438 7766507 45261  How is it, dude? What? Hey yeah! We could cover so much more ground! Oh yeah, Kenny doesn't have a phone 'cause he's poor. Great, cool. You got your pail. Come on in, Kenny. Let's talk.  Okay Kenny, here's the deal. Um, you know that we have this awesome plan to trick-or-treat on e-scooters this year. YOU... don't have a phone. It's probably best you trick or treat with someone else this year. Look, Kenny, I always told you that one day, being poor was gonna catch up with you. Okay? But you didn't wanna listen. You just kept on being poor, and now it's Halloween and you don't have a cell phone. He needs to hear this, Kyle. You know, people are just poor, and they think it's not gonna come back to bite them in the ass. Shouldn't have been poor, Kenny. So, uh, you guys think you're gonna get a lot of candy trick or treating this year? Oh, we have a little secret too! Be? I'm gonna be on an e-scooter taking all your candy!  That's what I'm gonna be! Sorry! Okay. Hold on! This is bullcrap!  We have to get more candy than anyone else, even if we die! Keep moving, Kyle! All right, over here. Come on! We've gotta make room for more candy. Come on. Eat as much as you can.  Yes you can, Kyle. Staci Nakabw says he just wanted to run back out and get his football. Dude, now you're just overreacting. Aww, what did I do this time? You go first, Kenny. I didn't even do anything wrong! Just stop being a baby, Kenny, and go!  Nobody gives a shit about Colin Brooks. Hey, I'm not poor, all right?! You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? You guys! You guys! The police are trying to say me and Kenny killed that douchebag, Colin Brooks. They questioned us for hours. They said they had enough to get warrants for our arrest. We know that! What the hell are we gonna do??  We're sorry for making fun of you. You told us to.  Ngh! You're still not even gonna help us?! You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? This is stupid. Oh Jesus. You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore! Tell them it wasn't us! Can you get off your god damn video game for five fucking seconds so we can have a conversation?! And that's why we have to break out of here ourselves.  Excuse me? Officer? No, it's not that. It's just...I noticed you're still riding your horse all the way back to camp. No, they don't, but... you can use cinematic mode to make it easier on yourself. Kyle, come on. We've gotta go. I had a vision, Kyle. Al Gore's ghost visited me. Well his ghost visited me, Kyle. He said he had a plan, and we needed to go. Are you in or not? Shhh. What was that? This is where Al Gore told me to go.  What are you doing here, Satan? Us too. But why?  Okay, but what do you want us to-? What are you doing?  No mortal. But what about you? Satan, come on. Are you really gonna stand there and not say you appreciate all the nice things humans have done for you lately? I mean, not sure if you've noticed, but we're pretty much doing things your way up here We can't do this without you, Satan. I can't believe it's the weekend, and I'm at school! Why? Of all the places we could hide, why do I have to sit here in school?! I'd rather be in jail than at school.  Yeah, I guess we're dummies, huh Kenny? Are you crazy? We just saw ManBearPig take down Satan. What the hell are we supposed to do against it?  We just sat in school... for nothing! I don't know where to start. First, it was all the school shootings, then these Wi-Fi scooters showed up, and now we know that ManBearPig is real and we could all be dead in a matter of years. I know there's a connection. But that isn't what matters. I can't deal with people anymore. It's just... everyone sucks so hard, you know? Everybody is so stupid. And they all walk around going "Nya na chai cha nyachacha chai cha." And the only thing that makes me happy, the only thing I can trust... is this.  I'll be in my room and my mom will come in and say... And then at school... And even my friends. My own friends! They'll be like... It's like, everybody needs something from me. All I want is a little time with my phone instead of always listening to people's needy bullshit.  Anxiety? Is that cool?  Oh my God, that's perfect! Just a God- can you wait?! Isn't that your job?! Aren't you a wait-er?!  It just so happens I have anxiety! That means I have trouble being around assholes who won't leave me alone!  Shut up. I have anxiety.   I'm on my phone!!  Listen up, people! I have anxiety! That means I'm in my shell and have a hard time expressing myself! I find it difficult to engage with others! So everyone shut the fuck up because my anxiety is up here right now!  What? What? Who is that?  Oh, sorry Craig. Didn't see you there. Oh, there's nothing stupid about it. Don't you wish you had a way to deal with your anxiety? I see it in you, Craig. With your parents and relationships? Imagine being able to shut them out for a little while, Craig, so you can focus on what matters. With Buddha Box you can cut out all the unwanted noise. Not have to deal with conversations that are of no interest to you.  Whoa, whoa! Hey! Excuse me, that's my Buddha Box. It relaxes me. Ask my therapist. I have anxiety, you dumb bitch!   Uhuh. Aw man, that looks, that looks sweet. Oh, PC Principal. Hello.  I'm letting go of stress and being calm, like the Buddha. Hey. Whoa man, what's going on? Are you suffering from anxiety? It's okay. I have it too. Anxiety is very real. But there is help for people like us.  What's going on? Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm dealing with my anxiety! Do you know how hard it is for people with my condition to come out and even do things like this?! Living with anxiety is awful, huh Craig?  Oh yeah! Sure! Yeah, because people with anxiety shouldn't be allowed to play sports! Right, Kyle?!   Heh heh, that guy's such a douche. What was that... what was that one show he was on? Oh yeah, that's it. B.J. and the Bear. That show was so dumb. What kind of monkey was that, anyway? What was that- what was that monkey he always had- Wait. What the? What the hell is this? Oh God damnit.  Mom, will you stop texting me? I'm trying to relax! We're doing everything we can to keep our anxiety under control! Do you think I even wanna be here right now?! I am freaking out!  Heheh, yeah. That's pretty cool. What do you want? You think I even want to be here, Kyle?! My therapist told me I need to force myself to go out and do things to overcome my anxiety! Oh! Oh, I see! People with anxiety shouldn't be allowed at water parks. Is that it, Kyle?  Hey everybody! Just so you know, Kyle thinks people with anxiety should just stay home! Yeah! I'm trying to come out of my shell, but Dr. Kyle here is just worried about his place in line. God damnit! I seriously can't get a minute of peace!  Why is it that people who don't have a Buddha Box are always flipping Buddha Boxes off the heads of people with anxiety?!  Everyone has anxiety? Oh my God. I know what I have to do now. Yo-you're right, Kyle! You're right!  To quiet one's mind, one must have a dialog with one's self. I have found enlightenment. But there are so many others who suffer. It's very important to take the time to shut out the outside world. In the Hindu religion, there's a saying, "Namaste." It means "fuck you, I have anxiety." At first I thought it was only a few of us, but then something was said to me by Kyle. He said "Eric, my friend, everyone has anxiety." I know what you're thinking: "Fuck Kyle." And normally I would agree with you, but hear his words. Everyone has anxiety. We must recognize this disease as an epidemic. Yes, fuck Kyle, but Mayor, we have to raise money to get everyone who has anxiety the tools they need to cope. Namaste. Fuck you too. Bike parade? That's so dumb. What are you doing? Don't lie, Kenny! You saw that Larry kid scoring chicks with his bike, heard about the cash prize, and you decided to do the bike parade behind our backs! I know 'cause I thought the same thing!  Jesus. Is this really what it's come down to, you guys? Whatever happened to *us*? It used to always be the four of us. Always. Now Stan's moved to a farm. I have anxiety. Kenny? Nobody really talks to Kenny. And then there's just... Kyle. We used to do everything together. What if we did this like the old days? If we order everything online, we can have it delivered tomorrow!  We need props, pyrotechnics, the works! Kenny, get on your mom's laptop and start ordering streamers, sparklers and rockets! Make sure everyone ships Next Day Delivery! This is gonna be just like the old times, you guys! My stuff's here!  Shut up!  Mom, were there a bunch of packages for me? I guess it's time to face it. We aren't going to get our stuff. At the... the ma-, the ma-ma-, the mall. Guess we haven't been to the mall in a while.    The changing faces of immigrants in America as told through bicycles. This is a waste of time, you guys. Kyle, did you get your stuff?! I got my stuff! Yeah, dude!  Stan and Kenny got their stuff too! Bring it all over to my house! We gotta get ready for the bike parade! There's no way we can't win, you guys. We are going to kill at the bike parade. We finally did it. We worked together, we overcame adversity, and everything is finally gonna be cool again. Yeah, how do we do the changing face of immigrants in America without the Philippines?!  Kenny, no! You can't do this! We've worked so hard, and we've come so close! Oh my G- Oh my God! My anxiety! My anxiety is going off, you guys!  Oh my God! We did so much! We went through all this and he just quits?! That's it! That's it! I'm gonna shoot up the skewl! No, 'cause it's not fair! You work your ass off for nothing, and now my anxiety's back, and I'm gonna shoot up the skeewwwwl! Kyle's right.  We are. It's just Kenny fucked us again. Yeah. Hey. What if there wasn't? What if the bike parade got cancelled? We're never gonna win the bike parade, but if we get cancelled, then everybody loses. How do you get anything cancelled? You bitch about it being insensitive! "What's offensive about a bike parade?" Kyle, you small-minded piece of shit! We should cancel you just for saying that. Everybody loses, you guys! Yeah. We're gonna need poster boards, markers, and lots of glitter and glue. Yeah, how can somebody who gives you whatever you want be a bad guy?  But we're outraged about something. We need glitter and glue. It's just such bullcrap, you guys. How come everything out there is getting cancelled, but when it comes to us, we just can't do it?  That's right. we've been selfish. We can't get the parade cancelled for us. We have to do it for all the other people who want it cancelled, but their voices aren't being heard! Come on! I'm actually pissed off now!  It is nihilistic and out of touch with progressive thinking!  Who would use the bike parade like some $20 hooker?  Add together the three and the three. Waaah!  Hey Eric. Oh, Jeez, want me to help you study? Oho, Black Panther? Well that was a great movie!  Well, what do you want me to do? I got hall monitor duty. Okay, Eric.  Wull it's the entire glee club this time! Oh crap! The math quiz? It's already fourth period? Well okay!  Waaaagh! Waaaaaagh! Father, can I talk to you? Well, what's troubling you?  You know, at school the kids used to all make fun of me sometimes. One kid would say something mean, a-and then the other kids would laugh. I know how lousy it feels. I learned to just walk away, not give 'em all the satisfaction. I know it seems impossible. I thought I'd be a punching bag my whole life, but now, I'm one of the popular kids. I even get invited to board game night at Stan's house. My point is, sometimes, y-you just gotta put yourself out there.  So, Kyle, did you know Father is a really good singer? You like to sing too, don't you? Aw, Father, wait a- Father!  Come on, Father, you can't give up so fast. Who cares? Who cares what people say? Aw, come on, you gotta be strong! Because I was you. Okay? I wasn't always this cool. I've been through it. But then one day, somebody told me something. He said "life is full of love and light and bountiful things," and you know who told me that? You did! Two years ago, in church! You have a right to go and be happy! And if people wanna keep tryin' to knock you down, well, fuck 'em! There's no church today! You all are just gonna have to find some'n' better to do!  Isn't this great, Father? Fresh mountain air, a nice warm fire, a nice warm fire. Yeah, the Lord is pretty cool. Happy birthday, Clyde!  Hope you don't mind I brought a friend. That's it! You're doing great! Nobody's staring. I'm gonna get us some soda pop. You just mingle with the other fellas! Wow! Sure, Kyle. Be right back, Father.  Huh-what's up? What are you saying, Kyle? Well, of course, you don't. Well I'm sorry for tryin' to help out somebody who didn't have anywhere else to turn. We'll both just leave. I thought you were better than that, Kyle.  Father! Father? Has anybody seen my priest? Father, where'd you go?  There you are! I've been looking everywhere. But you're missin' the party!  But, they just don't understand you like I do. But it's not your fault. Why?! But... I thought we were pals. Sometimes I wonder. ...No thanks. No.  Stan? Father. What?? No! No. He can't. Father, you did it! Does that mean you're gonna stay? Oh, hey fellas! What are you guys doing? Well, sure! Whatcha lookin' for?  I've got strawberry, vanilla, tropical passion... Tropical passion. It's like mango and kiwi. Yeah, and at five bucks a pop, we're gonna be rich! Oof.   Why'd you punch me, Eric?! I thought we were partners! You punched me in the face! Well what's that supposed to mean?! Well, I don't know how this means you can go and punch me in the face- Hi, Kyle! You know they took away their nap time. Yeah, I wish I had a little pick-me-up! Somethin' fresh and fruity to go with my lunch!   'Cause Eric told them! Please, Kyle! We still gotta pay people off! Run! Wow! You're so smart to think of a siphon, Kyle! Does this mean we're out of the vaping business, fellas? We're gonna get a butt-load of candy! Oh, boy! This is looking so great.  Hey, Dad! The big bike parade is this weekend. How's it look? First prize is $50!  How my decorations are coming. The big bike parade is this weekend. Well, you won't think it's dumb when I win first prize. I'm goin' all out this year. I'll finally beat Larry Zewiski.  Dad!  Mom, eh if I win the first prize in the bike parade, I'll give the money to you guys.  Look Dad, a whole new bicycle! I'll win the bike parade for sure!  Yeah, I guess I'm lookin' forward to it.  I guess my bike could be in the bike parade. I... I hadn't really thought about it. Oh yeah.    Hey Dad? I don't need anything more. I mean, if I don't win that bike parade, I don't care. I have you guys, and... that's more important than a bike parade will ever be. No I don't Dad. Hey, Mom. Hi Dad. They're the denominators, so they stay a four. I actually never saw Black Panther. No, I didn't see it.  I didn't make him fail, no! Get out of my house! Come on, get out!  Nnnope. You did all that instead of actually studying for the test? I didn't see Black Panther. Ii didn't see Black Panther in the theater! I sear on my mother's life, I don't care what you said about Black Panther! Goodbye!   Well, we're probably both gonna fail now because fourth period already started.  Shh! Butters, don't tell them our secret! Oh God, Butters!  What is your goddamn problem?!  Fuck this!  Can we go now?  Active shooter! Active shooter! ["All units, report in" The officer strikes various poses as he checks out the classroom. More gunshots are heard. Mrs. Nelson moves around to stay visible to the class]  Active shooter! Active shooter! Unit 5 in southwest classroom!  Southwest classroom, clear! ["Copy. Southwest classroom, clear."] Divide four by six? ["Report now!"] Why do we have to do this now? Hold on! You guys are using e-scooters on Halloween too? Dude!  Dude, what the hell are you doing?! Get off of me!! Yeah, 'cause you got a stupid box on your head!   My anxiety? Well, I have to admit: sometimes, when me and Tweek are together it's... it's like he wants my atten-  The six by the four! Yeah, Tolkien's probably sick of you cheating off him all the time. Oh, there's Butters! No. Just leave it alone, Clyde. Butters brings him everywhere. Why me?  Uh, Butters, can I talk to you really fast? Butters, you know, you can just bring your priest with you everywhere. I mean, sometimes the guys just wanna do stuff and not have a priest around. I'm saying it's just kind of awkward, Butters.  He's bumming everybody out. Nobody wants to hear about Jesus at a birthday party. It's not just me. It's everyone, Butters. He can try all he wants, but he just doesn't belong here.  What? What Mr. Hankey... tweeted? Oh. Jesus Christ, dude. Mr. Hankey. Mr. Hankey, everyone's really mad at you. Were you on Twitter last night? Did you tweet "The kids of South Park are retarded homos who can't play music"? Why would you tweet that?! All the kids are really pissed off! What do you want me to say? Mr. Hankey? What are you doing here? Me? What can I do?  You guys! Hey guys! I think I figured it out. How to get Mr. Hankey another chance.  There's by-laws in the city council that community service leaders can't be terminated without a hearing. I need you guys there as character witnesses. He has a right to be heard. He's meant a lot to this town. Come on, guys. We can't just turn our backs. How many times has Mr. Hankey been there for us? Look, he messed up, but I don't know if he deserves everything that's coming down on him. I wanna stand by my friend. I ''had'' a plan. ''You'' decided to call the Mayor a titless whore!  I don't know how much longer I can defend you. People are starting to think I'm shitty. It's October!  Okay, you do that. I have homework and stuff! Okay, fine! I'll help you. But listen to me: I don't care how restless you get tonight, NO AMBIEN! No! None! If you want my help this time, you aren't taking any Ambien tonight. That's the deal!  Mr. Hankey, stop!  You want them to erase me, too? Uh...   So just like that? Your parents sold your house and everything? Why would your sister wanna get addicted to those things? What are you talking about? Ike! Ike, do you have a vaping pen?! Dude! Gimme that!  What is this?  Are you joking?! Why do you want nicotine?! These things are bad for you! Do you understand?! Bad kindergartners! That's gotta be him. I'm gonna tell him if he sells a vape pen to my brother again, I'm gonna kick his ass!  Butters, are you selling vapes? WHAT?! I need to speak with the principal. I'd rather just talk to him. You know what I'm up to!  Don't touch me! Don't- touch me! You're selling it to kindergartners! You're such penises! You're so full of shit. Ronan Farrow? No he wasn't. Fine. But no more pushing it on little kids! You got that?! Just stop. It's so obvious what you guys are doing.  Can I talk to you for a second? Can I talk to you over here?  What did I say about pushing it on little kids?! Fun, fruity Vaping Man?! All right, how much do you owe the dealer? How much?! Look, my friend is very stupid and should have never gone into business with you.  I'm just seeing if I can help settle things. You probably don't realize it, but vaping is a really big problem at our school. Okay, look, this is the money I've saved up from my past three birthdays. Can we call this even and end it? What? Cartman, what are you doing?? Oh shit! Wha-what? What are you doing?? WHAT?! Mr. Mackey, I need to talk to you about some things going on at school. You know what I'm doing here! NO. Mr. Mackey, there's a big operation going on at the school Things are getting out of control- -and you need to know what's going on! What?! Let go of me!  What's bad?! You guys decided to beat up the dealer! How?! We are all in this together, Kyle! We gotta rob the vape shop, and then we can put this all behind us. Aah! Just shut up and keep pumping! Awww, shit! Mr. Marsh! All right, listen. I should have talked to an adult from the beginning. There are these three vaping syndicates at our school- -and these guys are one of them. They had someone buying stuff from here for them, and then they sold it to kids. The sixth graders, these guys, and Becky Thompson are all at each other for control of the playground. I was going to tell an adult, but these guys said they'd stop. How? Dude, it worked!   Oh my God. Dude. Oh my God. We should use these things to trick or treat on Halloween! Everybody get the app! This is gonna be the best Halloween ever!  Oh. Well, that's okay. We'll figure it out. We always do! Kenny, we've been talking and, the truth is, without a scooter, you're just gonna slow us down. Okay, okay. Cartman, that's not the point. That's enough, dude! Dude!  Jesus Christ! Where'd all these other people come from?! That's it! I can't go anymore! What are we doing? I don't... I don't know how I can keep doing this. So what as he doing alone on the playground? And there were bear prints in the snow? You saw what? Jesus. "Evidence of the creature of South Park." This is like a conspiracy Web site. ManBearPig? What? Al Gore. He said he was almost President once. He came to our town once to warn us about something,  Please, Mr. Gore! We need your help! ManBearPig isn't going to stop! Please, just tell us. How do you stop it? So, ahum, now maybe we can all work together, huh?  Okay, can we stop ManBearPig now?! Is it some sort of genetic mutation? What? Dude, come on. What are we doing? Wait. Wait, are you videoing us? Dude! You summoned Satan! Dude, Satan's not gonna go with us to the- Okay, so wait. Now you're saying that someone in our town made a deal with that thing? No! You can't!  But we do! ManBearPig is gonna kill everyone, and he's not gonna stop!  Nobody's coming for us, Stan. They think we're murderers. Mom?  Mr. Gore? Where have you been?! Yeah. Where have you been?! Well what happened to you? Are you dead or something? What, what?  I can't do this alone. I need help. What more do you want from me?? I've atoned for my mistake. I'm sorry that we were getting a lot of different information at the time. You know, even you were wrong about a lot of the things you said would happen a- Nothing. I didn't mean-  I am sorry, please! I'm cereal! Ah, I didn't mean to say you were wrong, just that some of your predictions didn't happen- Please, please, please!  I'll do anything! I just want everyone to be safe! Go where? Al Gore isn't dead. We shouldn't be out here. We're wanted by the police.  It's Satan. Work together how?? Credits?  Satan!  No. Satan, you can't die. If you can't stop ManBearPig, how can we be-?? Come back. Come back.   Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.  All right, looks like we're clear. This is the best place to hide. Where's the last place anyone would think we would hide? The scene of our supposed crime, dummies! We're safe here. Stan! How'd you find us here? Well, what's he want everyone to give up? What the hell is that? What is it doing? Here it comes! Block it!  What the fuck, dude?! They just scored again, you fat fuck! Can we get another goalie, please?! Go!  Go down the slide or get out of the way!   Get off my towel!  I got news for you, Cartman! Everyone has anxiety! Everyone gets nervous! Everyone is afraid being around people! Everyone has feelings they'd rather stay home alone! And you know what they do? They get over it. And they stop being a piece of shit!  Yes! What? No. No! What did I just do? What do you mean?  Four bikes, one common theme.  I'll start looking for costumes! What theme are we thinking? There's no time. Let's face it. We can't be in the bike parade. Oh yeah! The mall! There's nobody here. Are you the only one still at the mall? I think maybe it was a bad idea to come here, you guys. Yeah. And the four of us are actually doing a group theme. Yehehes! Yeessss! I got fulfilled! It's all the stuff I ordered for the bike parade.  Yeah? No, Dad. These were special deliveries from Jeff Bezos. We helped Amazon with their strike, and he had our orders shipped.  Yeah. We helped him find workers to work during the strike. So he found our orders and had them sent to us. They look amazing.  Come on, dude. We're gonna take 'em for a test spin. Well why not? Kenny, you can't quit now! We have a four-bike theme! How's it look like it's going? There's no way we're going to win this stupid bike parade!  Face it Stan! Our bikes suck! We're gonna lose! We're gonna be the laughingstock of the whole thing! I wish there never was a bike parade. What's offensive about a bike parade? Oh, I get it. I can't believe Kenny bailed on us just because he thinks Jeff Bezos is a bad guy. Such bullcrap.  No. No! The problem is that when it comes to outrage, your average person actually doesn't give a shit, unless it has something to do with them. Kenny was right about you. You're a bad guy! Why are you doing this?! AWWW! Shooter's in the hallway! All units report!   Put down the gun, son. You don't wanna do this. I flunked that test too. I don't understand fractions - they don't make any sense. Uh, hey, Mom.  Um... Oh- Oh, I... flunked my math quiz.  Oh, the school shooting? Oh, yeah, some kid shot up the school. No. No. What's up Mom's ass?  Do I have to go? It's the only day I get to play games.  ...Don't understand why we have to go to church every Sunday. I really don't understand the point of all that. But back then I don't know if church was that stupid. How many cards do you start with, Kenny? Okay, so I-I guess I'm gonna go to the saloon and try to arrest Cartman. I didn't invite him.   Uh, excuse me. What are you doing? Well, I mean, it looks like you're scrubbing and bleaching our tables and chairs. Yeah he was. I played with him. What's a Kumby? I have no idea what's going on. Dude, Kyle! Dude! Did you read what Mr. Hankey tweeted last night?! Yeah. I guess after band rehearsals he went on Twitter to talk about us. Nnnope. Dude, why do you keep defending him, Kyle? Mmmm. Once, kind of? Where will he go? Yeah, it takes me like an hour to get to school now. It sucks. All because Shelley bribed the playground monitor to let her vape during recess.  All right, where'd you guys get these?! Kindergartners said it's some big kid in a trench coat.  What are you gonna do?  Butters? Butters, do you understand this stuff is an epidemic in our school?! No, it sucks. I hate this. I wanna go back home. I hate you so much. No. Pleaes, no. It's not mine. I took it from a kindergartner. What are you gonna do? Oh God, this is just gonna get worse, isn't it? So anyone can use them? Oh yeah, it has one of them little scan thingies. Let me see.  Yeah, dude, it's downloading the app. Aww, it wants a credit card number. Let's do your mom's Is that an AmEx? Espiration? Security code? Pretty stupid but sweet.  We'd get, like, more candy than anybody. Yeah, but that's just it, Kenny. To use a scooter, you have to have a phone and... I mean, if we're waiting for you, we're gonna be as slow as all the other kids. It's... like, you know? We're sorry, Kenny. It's just... This awesome plan to get shitloads of candy doesn't... work with... you.  But we're not gonna tell people 'cause they're gonna copy us. So let's just leave it at that. What? Dude, we can't carry any more candy! I can't any more.  What the fuck?! It wasn't a bear!  It was at my house. There was a... thing. It attacked my uncle and took his friend. It was like a bear, but a pig... thing. It was at my house, and then here at the school! Everyone says that kid and I looked alike. What if that thing is after me?? Keep looking. There's a lot of people saying they saw it, Kyle. It's not just me. It's not a conspiracy, it's real. Keep going down. There's video.  I saw ManBearPig. Don't you remember, dude? We were warned about this. That weirdo guy who came and told us this would happen? He was right.  But it wasn't you guys. Who was that ex-President guy? The one who showed up and tried to convince everyone of a ManBearPig? Hello, uh, we're looking for a government sort of guy named Al Gore? Mr. Gore? Al Gore? I don't know if you remember us, but we're the kids you got to help try and capture ManBearPig? Well uh, eh eh, you were right. Ha, you, you were totally right. ManBearPig is real and, uh, he's killing lots of people in our town. There has to be something we can still do. Please, Mr. Gore. You're the only person who knows anything about it. We, didn't, we didn't realize there were more than- Yu-you told us to do all this. We know how. Where did ManBearPig come from? Why did the Devil send ManBearPig?! He was right before. All right all right, that's enough!  Oh shit!  God damn it! Nothing! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Making deals? That's gonna be impossible! Everyone, listen! ManBearPig is real! It's a demon that thrives on making deals to exploit mankind's weaknesses. I am super-duper cereal. We all have to work together, you guys. This one time. We have to all put our pride aside and be willing to say, maybe we were wrong. No! Nooo! Please! Somebody made a deal with ManBearPig! We have to find out who! Officer, you have to let us out of here! We don't have much time! Sir, you have to listen to us. ManBearPig is real.  Where the hell is Al Gore? Why isn't he coming for us? We broke out of jail, Dad. Cartman tricked the guards. We all ran home to be with our parents. Where's mom? Dad, that thing we saw take Ned? It was ManBearPig. It was real! No, Dad. It's...  Why do you keep looking at the TV?  You've been playing Red Dead Redemption?! I thought you were working on getting me out! You're all the way to St. Denis?! That's like 40 hours of gameplay! How could you uh! Are you high right now?! Oh my God! I can't believe you would get high and play video games while your son is in jail! You're such an asshole!  Yeah, because I learned a lot about-!  Whoa whoa, what are you talking about I sound like Grandpa?  Someone made a deal with it... a long time ago.  What did you do? This isn't the first time ManBearPig has shown up, is it?! What happened?! Cut the shit, Grandpa! You people knew! You made a deal with that thing!  Why did you old people make a deal?! And you just signed away the future?! What stuff?! You couldn't control yourselves, so now that thing is here to kill all of us! Good fuckin' job, Grandpa!  You didn't stop to think about what it would mean for us? And you didn't give two shits what it would mean for your grandchildren.  Aaaah. This is supposed to make me feel better? You... people... made a deal with ManBearPig! How?! Where?! Tell me how the deal happened so that I can try to make it go away!  Guys? Guys! Guys, thank God! Just stay right there, Grandpa!  I know all about the deal. I know what we have to do. I figured you guys would be hiding somewhere. This is the first place I thought to look. Guys, listen: my stupid grandpa and a bunch of other old people made the deal with ManBearPig. It's here because of their greediness. Shut up, Grandpa! I know where to go, but I need your help. I'm going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal. We have to try.  Listen! We know what to do now! No! I need to face ManBearPig! Yes I do. We're going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal once and for all. 'Kay. Yes. Yes, we agree to give back cars and ice cream.   Um, he says he'll never come back again, but... we have to give up soy sauce and Red Dead Redemption 2. ...Yeah, that's what I thought.  Um, could we possibly talk about restructuring a new deal? No, no. Just like, um, can we do, like, a renegotiation? Where do I sign that? Okay. Shut up, Grandpa! 'Key, got it. 'Kay, where do I sign that?  I think it's Cartman. Should have just let him be on his phone, dude. Think about what? Dude, nobody cares about a stupid bike parade. "Wassup" is I thought we agreed bike parades are stupid. Me too. We could totally own the bike parade.  Yeah, and we gotta order some badass spokes and those wheel bumpers! Anything? Did you get anything? Maybe if we reorder everything and have it shipped to a different fulfillment center- No! I refuse to believe we have no other options. Um, what...? What did we do before Amazon? I mean, before we could get whatever we wanted, where did we get stuff? There's gotta be somebody. Uh, hello? We came because... we need... stuff. What?? No!  No, no, look. We need very specific stuff. There's a big bike parade on Saturday.  Yeah. Uh, color-coded specific shoes in four specific sizes. What? H-Hold on a minute. You all stay here 'cause you want to work? Wait a minute. You guys... I think I have an idea. Uh yeah, hi. We ordered a bunch of stuff and we haven't gotten it. No, that's actually why we're calling. We know a whole bunch of people who can come work for you. What fools will pay? Yeah, but listen: we want our stuff! We ordered a bunch of shit for the bike parade, and if we get you workers, we want them to deliver our stuff first! Dude, we did it. You're not gonna do the bike parade? Commodity fetishism? Come on, Kenny, don't be a dick!  Don't shoot up the school. How's it going? Our bikes aren't so bad. I thought the four of us were unstoppable. What? How do we get the bike parade cancelled? Hey, yeah. We can go to the Mayor and force her to cancel it. Yeah! First thing we've gotta do to get the bike parade cancelled is raise awareness. We sure do, Santa! Nononono! Wait wait wait, please! I mean, are we supposed to just keep going? Just go on, making total asses of ourselves?  Yeah! What? Did we think this was a fucking joke? The bike parade is offensive, and the government thinks they can just force it on everyone! Mayor, we demand you cancel this bike parade! It's him.  No! I guess they are offensive.  Another school shooting today has left students in shock and disbelief.  Baby! Oh, you're okay! It's all right, Stanley. We're gonna go home and talk about this with your dad. And we will get through this as a family!  Come on, get in the car! Stanley? Well? Do you wanna tell your father about what happened at school today? Noo, the other thing! Yes, the school shooting!  Are you serious?! Did you not hear what your child said?! Kids died at his school! Why are you all acting like this is normal? What is wrong with you people?!  No, I'm not okay! Children were shot! They were killed at a school where they were supposed to be safe!  Why does there need to be anything else?! Are you kidding me?! Why isn't anyone else emotional?! Don't you dare suggest that I'm only emotional because it's- GET OUT, RANDY! I'M NOT OVERREACTING! Thanks for coming, everybody. I'm sure you all heard there was yet another school shooting today. We have to figure out what we're going to do as parents because this whole thing is out of control!  We have to ask ourselves why this is happening and do something now! What are you talking about?  Do you understand that our children are being murdered? How much closer to home can this all hit?  It was at our children's school!   Randy, they announced on the news there's been another school shooting in Jefferson County! What is "cool" about that?! GOD!  I keep thinking... When will be the time when I get the call? You know? When will I answer the phone and find out my son, my daughter, were... killed? At school? I live in constant fear that I won't be there to protect my children when something happens to them. What?  What I'm saying is that I'm so overwhelmed that I- What the hell are you talking about?! I don't understand!  What is it? Oh my God!  Come on, we have to hurry! Why?? What the fuck is going on?  Realize what?! What have you been telling everybody, RANDY?! Menopause?! I'm not going through fucking menopause! I just got my period this morning! YES! YES! NO! NO NOTHING! Don't you guys see what's happened here?! I want you to be angry! Every day we hear about another school shooting! It used to be a big deal! I want it to be a big deal again. I mean Harriet, you came to my house and said there was a school shooting to trick me into going with you! Randy...  we need to talk. There's been... too much pain and suffering, and... it has to stop. What I'm trying to say is... I've been very emotional lately, and... maybe... maybe I do overreact sometimes. Maybe I need to realize that my emotions can be hormonal and not just take things out on you. Randy, I'm... sorry. Sorry, sorry, one second.  There's been another school shooting. Stan's been shot.  All I know is that after church I feel better. I just feel so empty. What do you mean? Are you being serious? How will we make a living? Randy, I think we need to have a talk. Uh, well, not great. Uh, Stan got caught with a vaping pen. You know, those little pen and cartridge things with the mist? Randy, where are you going? We're never goin' to have enough candy. Randy, it's time to face it. Your weed farm idea didn't work. You barely sell to two people a day.  What happened at school today? Who shot up the schoo-  was it you? Did you get shot? Oh...  Well, what's this about failing a math quiz? I'm sorry, Sharon. I...  Hey, Sharon, ya... doin' okay? Uh huh, and... what else is goin' on?  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sharon. ...Hun, uh...  When was your last...? I mean, you know how sometimes things can seem like a little bigger deal 'cause you know, your... down there? I mean, I'm just, I'm just pointing out that it is around that time. Okay. Okay, love you, honey. I'll leave you alone.  I agree with my wife. ...Anybody need a drink?  Everything's going fine, and then at a certain time of the month I have to start walking on eggshells. It's just. it's just once I'd like her to acknowledge it, you know? Just once say "You know, maybe I was overreacting a little bit 'cause of my hormones."  Okay, Sharon. Cool. Nuh-nothing. I love you, sweetheart. I don't know. I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's like, I turn on the TV and dread they'll say something about a school shooting because it's gonna set my wife off.  What... what do you mean? Menopause? I don't even know what that is. Uh huh. But... if a woman isn't having periods anymore, then why would she still overreact and be bitchy? Well wait, you're saying this could actually get worse?  Oh my God! How long does it last? You... you got your period? You just got your period this morning? Soooo the past few days, maybe you have been just a liiittle- Aw guys, uh she didn't mean it! She just... get, give her a...  Sure, honey. I know, sweetheart, I know.  Aaaaah? Aaah? Aaaaah? Aaaah. Aaaaaah.  What is it? Shuh-should we get down there?  Come on, guys, we don't wanna be late! We're all going. Come on!  Church is important, Stan. Way more important than video games and TV. Church is about community and coming together. A lot of things. Yeah. Me too. Hey, mornin' Stephen, Linda. You got it- hey, where's Josie? Aw, she's gonna miss church? That's too bad. Give her my best.  Kind of like a priest in a room full of naked boys.  Oh, that was a great one, Nelson. Salvation in a little boy's mouth. I'm gonna post that one for sure.  Yeah, well, I used to think that about church when I was a kid too. Hey, don't say things like that, Stan! You wanna go to fuckin' Hell?  Hang on! Hang on! I gotta post this! This is hilarious!  Four boys and a priest playing a board game! Nononoait, let me get the picture.  Aw shit, I missed it! Hey, mornin' Mackey! Ah, doin' better, huh, Josie? All right.  It's not open. Hey! Hey, it's nine o'clock! Hey!  Hey...  Well this sucks. What are we supposed to do without church? Shut up, Shelley! What's it all about, huh? Are we just bags of carbon and water put on this planet for no purpose? You're born, you die, then you're just... food for the worms. The church is back open?  Hey! What uh, what are you guys doing? Last week? No, he was at my house a couple of days ago playing board games with the boys. Boring  Father!  Hey, hey Sharon, it's Father! He's back! Hey, Father's back! Oh uh, no. I haven't seen, Butters. Or Stan. But Father, please, we all need church. Please, Father, we're all lost, and the cleanup crew hasn't helped at all.  Stephen! Stephen, listen! The boys are missing! Fr. Maxi thinks they've been taken by the other priests!  But seriously, we have to find these guys! The boys are in danger! What-what'd she say? Can, can I post that? Yeah I'll bet.  Kind of like how getting raped by a Catholic priest is undeserved.  Oh God, it's good to have my faith back!  My God... He'll have to find a place that accepts racist, awful beings like him. There are still places out there who don't care about bigotry and hate. Exactly what kind of trouble is Shelly in, Mr. Mackey? Her butthole??  Why would the recess monitor want a picture of my daughter's butthole?! Jesus Christ, how much worse can things get around here?! Seriously?! Dog's butthole?! That's what we're doin' now, huh?! There's not enough bad things in the world, we get called into school, "Here's a dog's butthole for ya." That's what it's all come to, Shelly?!  I am seriously over it. Don't you just wanna start over? Go back to simpler times? I've had it. School shootings, pieces of shit taking Ambien and tweeting, priests raping kids, and somehow... I'm not laughing anymore. Let's do it, Sharon. What I've always talked about. Let's get out of here. Go buy a farm and live off the land. Never been more serious.  Let's move out to the country. Go back to simple living when things mattered, like hard work and 'tegridy. By growing things and, and selling what we make with our hands. We can do this, Sharon. It's time. Mornin' Joe? How's the farmin'? Well that's fine, Joe, just fine. I'm growin' some Green Willy Stranger myself. And the Catatonic Tegridy Bud is takin' well.  So long, Joe!   Name is right there on the sign. Come on back! Now, what about the Tegridy Jungle Bud? Yeah? Yeeahh?!  All right!  Howdy. What can I do ya for? Yeah, name's right there on the sign. Really? Hey, that'd be great. What kind of company-   Oh no, sorry. I don't want my Tegridy Bud put in those pussy sticks. Yeah, you know. Penis pens, wussy vape, lady joints. Not on my farm, no sirree. That's nice. Now how's about you take that pussy stick and get off my farm before I shove it up your ass and you're blowin' mist out your butthole?  Yeah, whatever. All you're doin' is blowin' smoke -- Sorry, "fruity steam." Pussy. Go vape some more, ya fuckin' puss! Whatcha doin', Joe? Just like that, huh? You gonna let those people with pussy sticks take over everythin'?! Oh. I hope you didn't pack your tegridy, 'cause clearly, Are you still here?! Agh!  Isn't this great, Stan? Livin' off the land?  Well you see that? We're talkin' now.  When was the last time we really talked like this? Ithink we're havin' a breakthrough moment. I want to give you somethin', son. Somethin' I made that I want you to have.  It's a hemp hat. Come on, let's just see how it fits. Here, just-just look. Just try it.  Whoa. Bless us, Lord, and our little cannabis farm, and may we always keep our tegridy. Amen.  So, how was everyone's day?  With a WHAT?! Stan had a vape pen?!   Where did you get this?! Yeah, right! My own son using a pussy stick!  Don't you know what these things are doin' to our way of life?! I've had enough! You think I'm just gonna stand around while they destroy my family?! We've worked this farm and this land for over four days! I'm not about to let some vape queens take it all away from us!   All right, you bunch of vape-smoking' pussies! You try and take my way of life?! Time to show you some tegridy!   Get your stupid mist out of my fucking face! Yup!   I don't think so! Just what the Sam Hell you boys doin' here?! It's good you came clean, son. It shows that you've got-  Yeah. She taught me somethin' else too! If you're gonna fight for your tegridy, don't forget to bring a towel. Yeah!   Well, shit. Looks like we made it to another sunrise. Yup son. I think the fight's just startin'. Farmers like us are under attack. Yehello? Oh, I see. You want a place to hide on Halloween night, and you thought out here on the farm you'd be safe. You think them fancy e-scooters don't make it out here? We're gonna be bombarded just like you city folk. I gotta keep what I have.  Hey!  What the hell are you guys doin' on my farm? A bear?   Stan?! Come on. Get out of sight.  Your mom's been out trying to find you a lawyer and a therapist. We've been doing all we can! What are you talking about? It was just a bear. What? Why? I dunno? What? A little bit. I mean... when I'm not doing all this stuff for you Sorry, I needed a little break! I'm a little high, yes! Oh what?! I'm sorry! I'm sorry that I need to decompress with all this shit going on!  Well at least I'm not a school shooter! Oh whatever!  "ManBearPig! ManBearPig!" You sound like your freakin' grandpa! He had been talking about ManBearPig comin' since I was fuckin' 14. Nothin' new. Do you know how to craft stamina tonics?  I have a weed business to run! I need my shit from Amazon to make it all work! Oh yeah, that's typical rhetoric from a Marxist box. I can't even believe you would say that, Sharon! It's the stupid Amazon strike! I rely on things for marketing, Sharon! A small business needs products for exposure, and until those assholes go back to work, small businesses are gonna suffer!   Aw yeah yeah, Of course. Out early today, huh?  Yeah, tell me about it. Uh, yeah.  You're strikers? Okay, okay, hold on. Uh, let me got some more weed.  Huh.  All right, there you go, friend. That's an ounce of weed, and thanks for supportin' small business. Next? Sorry friend, that's the law. Us simple farmin' folk respect the law and each other.  Well don't buy weed from them. Their weed sucks. Shit! This whole Amazon strike has more people smoking weed than ever. We have to make sure Tegridy Weed stays ahead of the competition! Yeah, like a, like a delivery service. Some way so people don't have to drive out here and even see the other weed farms! You mean the things that almost killed us all on Halloween? Yeah, I 'member.  Oh shit. We could have Tegridy all over town.   Bezos! Bezos! Hello Bezos! You can take your fulfillment center and fulfill it right up your ass! See, there's one thing you didn't count on, and that's Tegridy! Just look in the eyes of these people!  Everyone has Tegridy now! Tegridy that you will never understand! We aren't just different classes of people anymore, we are a town! Why do you ask that? Oh. Hang on.  Hold on. Okay, I got it. Anyways... you see, Tegridy is something that can't be understood by big corporations! Oh, they'll try to package Tegridy, but only I can really package Tegridy. I got more money now 'cause of Tegridy, and that's 'cause I figured out how to get Tegridy to everyone. And that's- now everyone is in their state of Tegridy that's impenetrable. Am I making sense? The point is, nobody's comin' to work for you! So you can take your whole plan and fulfill it somewhere else!  I understand that there have been some problems here at the school lately. A lot of students are experiencing anxiety, and Eric Cartman just wanted to be able to voice his concerns. Go ahead, Eric.  How exactly did Tolkien manipulate your grades, Eric?  Is that true, Tolkien? Did you do somethin' to make Eric fail a test? Vice Principal Strong Woman? I was seeing if there's anything you... might want to discuss with me? I am- so sorry- that I took advantage of my position and- manipulated you into a physical encounter. Are you sure we can move forward? I was just thinking there might still possibly be some fallout from- You don't think there's anything else to dis- to discuss? All right, everyone, listen up. The vice principal has asked to speak with you today. She believes it is time that we all as a school finally discussed in-vitro fertilization. That's right, Strong Woman. In today's society it is wrong to just assume that a pregnant woman had intercourse with a man. St-students at this school need to be careful because it can be offensive to ask questions like "Who's the father?"  You- you all right, Strong Woman? So-so we'd like to have all our students talk to their parents tonight about in-vitro fertilization, and after that, let's just put the whole issue behind us.   It's okay. We'll be at the hospital soon. Just keep breathing. I'm just a co-worker helping another co-worker in need. I certainly do not want to put an pressures on you as a female, but at times I wonder if there is more we should discuss. That she is. Oh, dude. Bro. I think it's wrong to force gender specification upon them at this young age. What's that? Doctor, would it be possible for me to... hold the PC babies? Vice Principal? Shh it's okay. The babies are fine, resting in the nursery. They're the most...  they're the most PC babies I've ever seen. Look I was the one who abused my position and took advantage of a subordinate- N-Not took advantage. You know what I'm saying. All I want to do is help. We can say I'm the manny. And if anyone has a problem with that, then they have a problem with gender biases, and they can take it up with me! We can keep the truth about the babies totally hidden.  Oh yes, very good, Vice Principal. See that it is done by back to school night. I am the manny. Anyone have a problem with that?  Is everything all right? Oh, no, we're from uh, Missouri. All right, please move along, folks. We don't want the babies to get excited.  They're so strong, like their mother. Can they ever know that I'm their dad? Then I'll just try to be the best principal to them that I possibly can. I'm busy.  I'm busy doing stuff!  What?! Uh-uh yes? Uh yeah, we just uh, we're having an important scheduling to go over. That's in the past, Mackey! We've paid our dues, and we're not hiding anything anymore. What's going on?? All right, what word did you use, Riley?! Look, can't we put them in a daycare? Well maybe they won't! I don't know what makes you think you're different from everyone else, but nobody gets away with slandering teachers at this school! Hey!  Just what do you think you're doing? There are no boxes on your head in school! What are you talking about? Oh hey, I just needed to answer a couple of e-mails really fast. I got one for you, too.  Look, you and I have been having a lot of problems. Clearly, what we both need is more quality one-on-one time with our phones. I'm sorry!  It's okay. We're gonna find them. You were on your phone too! You're seriously gonna make this all my fault?! Because last time I checked, you didn't even want me around as a partner to the PC Babies, even though I- Even though you need me to do shit for you every  I'm her superior at work! You think I took advantage of my position?! I'm not Harvey Weinstein, all right?! I have nothing but respect for females at my workplace, and I would never compromise that position!  Tha-that's Bailey! Cone on!  Kids!  Yea, and ah-I'm their principal. We need to get these kids back to school. Oh my God. They had their first protests... and we missed it. We missed everything because... we were on our phones. You know what we have to do, right? All right everyone, listen up. The vice principal and I have been discussing student health, and it's our firm belief that they need, and what we all need, is less time on our phones.  Yeah... Nobody's listening. And nobody's watching.  I got this one.  All right, everyone, get down! Everybody get the fuck down! M'kay, m'kay, who's shootin' up the school? Everyone down!  Over this way! Into the cafeteria! Right over there, m'kay- No, you shot the wrong one! Well Happy Sunday! Mornin' Ted, Hazel.  And with your spirit, m'kay? Uh, oh my name is Counselor Mackey, and w-uh we seem to be havin' a little problem with our local church here in South Park. Our uh... our priest has gone missing. Well, it's not suspicious, we just kind of don't know what to do, you know? Uh. Allright, thanks for comin' in today to discuss your daughter's behavior, m'kay? Well, unfortunately, we found out our playground monitor has been accepting favors to look the other way at recess, and uh, your daughter sent him an inappropriate picture. Of her butthole. M'kay? We've been havin' a lot of issues at the school with kids vaping lately and, uh, they bribe the recess monitor however they can. Uhkay, let- uh, the, there is good news, m'kay? We had the picture analyzed and it turns out it was actually just a picture of a dog's butthole, m'kay   Oh, hello, Kyle. M'okay, like what? Huh okay.  Whoa!  Alright, who left their scooter here?! Okay?! Whose damn scooter is this?! What the hell??   Oh, PC Principal! Are you going in to see the vice principal? I really need to speak with her. Everything is okay with you two? There's no more "inappropriate behavior"? You know, as a counselor, I'm here to- Mmm-m'kay.  Active shooter, active shooter! Well, you know, Sharon, I think... its a complex issue, you know. It's... it's not really as simple as just...  Red?  It's all right, Randy. Well, Randy, have you stopped to think that maybe this problem is bigger than Sharon's period? I mean that maybe what's going on really is a big deal. What if this is actually... menopause? Randy was just trying to make you feel loved while you're going through menopause. How do you know? Yeah, let's go somewhere without so much negativity.   Morning, guys. And a Catholic priest raped him.  Oh that was Linda! Hey Randy, what's up?  But where would priests go this late at night? She said, "To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us." Sure, she doesn't care. Well yeah, we got a really weird text from him saying not to worry, he needed to do some camping. Well that's ridiculous! We, we can't all buy that much candy! Let's just get rid of those scooters! Heh hey Randy. Linda and I, we... we were talkin' about how we never see you guys anymore, and we were thinking we'd hang out with you for Halloween, heh. Well, that, and we really wanna hang with you guys. Then please, Randy, can we just borrow a little candy? Please, Randy, the stores are all out! Just a few Milky Ways to get us through the first couple hours, please! We can cut 'em up. We can- we can hand them out little pieces at a time. It's okay, Linda! It's okay! On Halloween night, I'll... I'll just one of those e-scooters myself. I'll go around and, and I'll trick-or-treat. I'll... I'll get a bunch of-  I'll get a bunch of candy, Linda, and I'll bring it back to our house for us to hand out! It's going to be okay.  Trick or treat! Happy Halloween! Trick or Treat! That's not true! Yes I do! I'm Megyn Kelly! Now trick or treat!    I'm sorry. It's just this new job. It can be such a grind.  Kids these days just don't understand how much their parents break their back to provide.  Goodbye, Linda. So this is where all the main boxing and transferring happens. I'm excited to have you guys working here at the fulfillment center, Mr. and Mrs. Tweek. Yeah, people are ordering everything online these days. That's why you'll find a lot of familiar faces working here.  Everything's automated and timed to precision to get people's orders out to them as soon as possible. This is Josh, he'll be your section manager. In these warehouses, there are over one million items, from toothpaste to Go Karts, and it's the work of both humans and machines that make the work possible.  Josh!  Whenever there's a workplace accident, you need to fill out a 1081 form.   Can I have a beer, please? Whatcha got on tap? Gimme Amazon Light. I'm a Prime member.  Yeah, well, we should be thankful we even have jobs, huh? Before the fulfillment center opened, we really didn't have anything.  Okay, hold on, everyone. I'm sure there's an explanation. Hold on, guys.  M-My son has a big bike parade coming up. I... I can't just not show up to work now. A bike parade.  There's no easy way to say this, so I'll... just come out with is then. We're... not Amazon Prime members anymore.  Everyone involved in the strike has been dropped down one level from Prime. We're... we're now Amazon USDA Choice.  Please... I don't know what else to do. My family is all that matters to me.  What if they just get others to do all the boxing for us?  My family has to come first.  Don't you understand? It's not about me! It's my son! He's just a kid! He wants to be in the bike parade!  Welcome to the fulfillment center. I'm your floor manager, Stephen Stotch.  Sure it is. You just gotta get into it, okay? That's one order down, we have  What the--? I don't understand. I guess I did. The bigwigs promoted me to manager. I'm been training new employees.  When did all this stuff arrive?  Yeah, it's not always easy being a fulfiller, but I think, eventually, you'll find it's a rewarding job.  What do you want, Stuart? What are you talking about? No it isn't, Butters. I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to join my friends in striking but... I know that you have to have your stuff to be happy.  What?  Sure are, Butters. Well, there certainly are things that need changing. Just yesterday, I was at the park with my son Craig and... have you seen the state of the playground equipment? Not only does it seem unsafe, but it's become quite an eyesore. The whole park could use an upgrade, if you ask me. It's become a campout for the homeless. Let me try.  He's not going to take this well. Amazon Boxes?!   Oh. My what? You got a-? Are, are we splitting that? Do you have more?  Well you see, Mr. Marsh, when the woman's ovaries actually stop producing eggs, it's a significant change. It's this ending of the menstrual cycle in a woman's life that we call menopause. Well actually, menopause is one of the most severely hormonal times a woman ever goes through. It's good you sought the advice of a medical professional, because the changes in your wife's body are gonna be confusing and at times hard to cope with. I'm afraid so.  You see Mr. Marsh, menopause is almost like a super period, and it's been known to last... for up to two years. 'Bout what? We're trying, just talking a lot and seeing if we can work things out. That's... really none of your business.  I don't know what you're talking about. We've never talked about it.  I gotta get to class. Mmmhmm. Yeah I see. Well, Sharon, have you maybe considered that your feelings are partly due to... handkerchief balls? Handkerchief balls. Handkerchief out the balls. [Randy signs: "''she used to have periods'',"] Red handkerchief. ["''but now she's old and going through menopause''"] No- no more handkerchief. No more- no more red. Zero. Empty. Old lady. Old lady, where's my dick?  Where's my dick?  And you believe this all relates somehow to the movie Black Panther not being as good as everyone says it was? Oh ahh, d'ya, sorry. Just...  Uh, well, you know, young people have so much to deal with today. I believe that what you have is... anxiety. It's pretty common these days. What it really is, more than anything is an excuse to be lazy and lame to everyone around you. Anxiety can make you feel unable to cope. But living with someone who has anxiety can be a bit of a roller coaster as well. We have to support our loved ones with their anxiety and try to understand their illness. Well, because his anxiety make him feel like anything he says might sound wrong. That's why we must nurture our loved ones, so they feel safe. Maybe you, you wanna text him that?  Look, we're all just trying to understand this condition, and it's like you're not listening! We enjoyed it, yes. Oh, no not the family. Tolkien's mom and I saw it on date night. We're gonna watch it again with Tolkien, though. We don't let him watch it alone because it's PG-13. Tolkien? Well, Tolkien wouldn't do that. No, Sharon. You go ahead first. To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us?  Yes.  What are we gonna do??  No, you can't leave me alone! Butters really loves that bike parade.  You work too hard at that place. Don't let that place work you to death. There he is!  How did it go? Then what are we?  That's... fine. We'll be USDA Choice. It's, it's almost as good as Prime. Stephen! Stephen! It's a miracle!  You must have gotten our Prime membership back! It just came a few hours ago.  Oh Stephen, you did it! Sharon, Sharon, you have to come quick! There's another shooting happening at the school right now! It just started. Maybe we can make it in time! You just- ya-you should go.  I was just trying to be a part of the big surprise, Sharon. Well. Sharon, if you wanted to make me sad, congratulations.  You did everything you could, Mr. Marsh. If your wife can't realize the truth and appreciate you, maybe she never will. That's what I'm talking about! That's crazy, Harriet! I want you all to be shocked! I want you all to be sad! You want everyone to be sad? Aww thanks there, Randy. Oh, she slipped her disc in her neck. Poor thing can barely move. We gotta get more candy!   But no exact correlation to a ManBearPig! For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,  so that whoever believed in him should have eternal life. This is the Gospel of the Lord.  Today's gospel talks about what the Lord has to give us. He did so because we could not control our temptations. Uh Okay, okay, let's, let's try and have none of that today. In John 3:16, the Gospel tells us how God so loved the world he gave to us his only Son Okay, okay, Co-come on guys, Nu-now, what greater gift could the Lord has given to us? Okay, let's, let's try to compose ourselves. Let's try and just get through this first one, okay guys? What does it mean that the Lord gave us his only begotten Son? Oh, of course, my child. What's troubling you? Well, we can't all walk away. The-the priesthood is all I know. I, I dedicated my entire life to it. Ah I don't know anything else. Uh, hello, my children.  Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.  Uh, I shouldn't be here. I should go. This is just gonna make things way worse. People will rip on me. I do.  Why do you care?! I have to admit it's a pretty nice way to spend a Sunday. How many are your works, Lord? In wisdom you made them all. He is. Because he brought me you. For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works. Come on, Father. Let's go tear up the skating rink.  Uh-ah. Oh, Mother Mary. I feel like everyone's staring at me.  And now let us pray. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. which we are about to receive.  He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens... ...through Christ our Lord. Amen. All right, my child. Just leave me alone. Look, your friends are right, okay? I don't belong there. I, I don't belong anywhere.  Stop defending me! There are things you don't know! Yes it is! It is my fault!  Because I knew, all right?! I knew! Years ago, when bad things started coming out about the Catholic Church, I went to the Vatican and ... I found out that the problem was worse than anyone even thought. I thought I could help fix it, so, I kept my mouth shut. I thought there was cancer in the Church that we could get rid of. But the Church ''is'' cancer. It's not about a few bad apples. There are only a few good apples, and I'm clearly not one of them. So just stay away from me! You thought wrong.  Hello, Mr. Marsh. M, Mr. Marsh- -please. I'm just going around trying to locate little Butters Stotch. I thought he might be here playing a board game with your son? I'm sorry, but I have to keep looking.  I said some terrible things.  What cleanup crew?  Give me that! Mr. Stotch, have you heard from Butters at all?!  Oh my Lord. I know where to go. And when we get there... I'll need to go in alone. Wait!  You wanted to find me? Well, here I am. I know why you're here. The Church can't have... someone like me going around making it look bad. So go ahead.  Do it. Just get it over with. A transfer? I can just... go? I can start over in the Maldives? Yes, I do. I don't think I have any other choice. I'm so sorry, my child. I never meant to say we weren't pals. Of course. Now I have purpose, and I have meaning. My job here is to protect you. All of you. The Lord be with you. Today I'd like to talk on the subject of penance. The penitent... have deep remorse, but for true penance, we must be humble enough to admit that the Lord's forgiveness is undeserved. In Job 42:6 we read "Therefore, I reprehend myself and do penance in dust and ashes" So we are not to punish ourselves, but instead, we are to make ourselves passionate. Passionate to understand all that Christ sacrificed, and how hard it truly was. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.  And with your spirit.  Children's underwear which priests couldn't pull down so easily?  What's going on?  I was stressed out and feeling anxious. After just 8 to 10 hours in Buddha Box, I feel refreshed and ready to take on anything. It means that if you're a cute boy at a Catholic priest's swimming party you'd better be gettin'!  And in choir boys' butts and asses.  Who said the thing about naked boy salad? Ohh, PC babies!  Well, see ya next week, everybody!  What? $6,000? Keep going, Ned! Don't you give up on me!  The hell are you doing, Stotch? You're just trying to get our candy for your house! You don't even have a costume! Yeah-heah! You got it, Ned! That was a nice shot! Come on, let's see what we got.  Looks like a bear. A huge one! Come on, the tracks go this way.  Look at that. Looks like bear droppings. But with a man poop right next to it. What the hell are we dealing with, Ned? Whatever it is, it was heard recently.  We're trackin' a bear, Randy. Where're you goin' Ned? Jesus Christ!  Whoa! NNEEEEDDDD!! Yeah, see ya! See ya! Bye. Morning.  The church is back open! Thank God! Let's go! (Two cards.)  (What?) (Oh wait, you guys. See, I don't have a phone.) (Woohoo!)  (Hey dude, check it out! I got my pail!) (Yup!) (But we always trick or treat together) (Guys, please.) (Hey dude. Uh, look. I was wondering, do you think I could trick or treat with you guys this year?) (Oh, you know, I just thought I'd switch it up this year, hehe) (Oh I won't slow you guys down. I swear!) (Hey guys!)  (So listen, I was thinking, maybe I'd trick or treat with you guys this year!) (Oh, you know! Just trying to be gender-neutral, hahahaha!) (I, I just... It's Halloween and I should be happy, but I'm not happy at all.) (Yeah! What should I do? I'm gonna miss trick-or-treating. It sucks.) (I can't use one. I don't have a phone.) (No. It sucks. Halloween was a night without phones, man.) (I don't know. I guess if you-)  (Wait a minute. Take down the cell phone tower. Then nobody has a phone on Halloween!) (Yeah! I just have to ride thirty minutes outside of town! Oh, wait. I can't. I don't have a scooter.) (Let's just hope to hell this works.) (Yeah, people don't even care if shit's dumped everywhere. Everyone just loves technology) (Find a way inside. I'll climb the tower.) (Oh, fuck!)  (Dude, relax. It's okay.) (Okay, that's got it!)  (Trick or treat!) (What the fuckin' hell, dude?) (Fuck that, you go first!) (Neither did I!) (You mean Al Gore?) {Jim Turner?} (A demon?!) (Well what's that mean?) (Yeah, are you in or not?)  (Sounds like a fuckin' werewolf!) (What the fuck is that?!)  (No...) (Yeah!) (Oh shit!)  (Uh huh!) (Yeah, I guess we're dummies.)  (What?! You scared me, guys! Wassup?) (Bike parades ARE stupid.) (Yeah!) (No. Nothing.)  (Well I don't know.) (The mall!) (Yeah. Shit, let's get the fuck out of here.) (No, Dad. These are all for the bike parade.) (Guys, listen to me. I'm not gonna do the bike parade.) (It's complicated. I talked to my father and he says it's all a bunch of commodity fetishism.) (Yes, it's stupid, but I'm out.)  (I can't do it, guys! I quit.)  (You guys don't understand! My dad is one of the strikers!)  Mornin'. Morning. A lot better. Thank you. What are you guys so upset about? Denver archdiocese. The Lord be with you.  All right, listen to me carefully. Your local priest has not done anything wrong. He's probably just taking some time off. Why is that suspicious? We'll take care of it. There's no need to involve the authorities. Just sit tight.  We've got another one. A priest on South Park has gone rogue and is probably out doing his thing. I need you guys to get up there and clean up his mess. Don't worry, Your Holiness. By the time we're done with that town there won't be a lick of cum anywhere. Scrub everything! Police can detect even a milligram of cum and rectal blood! Oh uh, hello my children. The Lord be with you. Oh, we're just giving the place a nice scrub down while we wait for your priest to come back. He was called to South America last week.  No he wasn't. Look, I assure you everything is fine. Your priest will be back. Just have some patience. Scrub everything. Bleach those board-game pieces. You find something on that chair? Well, just get rid of it. Bleach the entire top of the table. That's probably where he mounted them.  Oh. Hello, my son. What are we doing about what? Mmm mmm, that's not what's going on. Your local priest was never here, actually. Oh, you did!  We're just here to cleanse your spirit, my child. All right, clean and scrub everything. I want it spotless! Get any evidence the priest might have left behind. It's an 8-year-old's birthday party. Of course, it's cum. Get the Kumby!  Hello, young man. We're looking for your town priest. Was he here? Tell me about this Butters. Hey. Hey there. What's the matter, my child? Did you know that Jesus loves you? "And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me."  Want a Three Musketeers? You like camping trips? You wanna go camping? I got a bunny in the back. You wanna see the bunny? Any sign of him? All right, when the priest gets here, we'll take care of him and then eradicate this place of any evidence. No, this is gonna be a bigger job than that. Bring out... the Kumboni.  Try the priest call.  Oh he's coming all right. Just not here. Let's start packing up. You.  Get on the Kumboni and eradicate this place along with everything in it. You think we searched all over town and set up this trap to kill you? We're Catholics! We're here to give you what you deserve! A full transfer to the beautiful Maldive Islands. Luxury airfare and beach house included!  The Church took care of everything, just like it always has from the beginning. "Thank you for cleaning up all my cum." No one will make fun of you there. They can't even speak English. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of priests to take your place here. Look, I know it's a big change, but... you know what you have to do. Well, our work here is done! Praise be to Christ, guys. It certainly was a tough one, but I think we got everything cleaned up and-  Aaaaugh!  Dude, what are you talking about?! I don't care, I don't want a priest at my fucking birthday party! Kyle, will you do something please?! All right, that does it!  Worst birthday ever!  As soon as the school bell rings, we find the nearest scooters and begin trick or treating in Butters' neighborhood here. Then at 3 p.m. we-  Cover it! Cover it!  Oh. Hey Kenny. You wanna trick or treat with us? What about Stan and Kyle and those guys? Yeah, look, don't tell anybody, but, um... we're gonna trick or treat on e-scooters this year. We're seriously gonna rake in the candy. Problem is, e-scooters work with a phone and pretty sure  you don't h-have one Dude, it's trick or treat. It's not something we're just willing to mess around with, okay?  Fine by us. So what are you gonna be for Halloween? Does anyone have a signal? It all does seem pretty meaningless. You're drivin' carpool today or not?  "Amazon regrets the recent workplace accident and is working to better train its workers so that no future accidents occur." This is what we've been reduced to! We are the backbone that makes the fulfillment center work! Maybe they should see what it would be like if we didn't show up for work!   Amazon workers, we are on strike!   Here comes the bus! Hey, it's Stotch!  Jeff Bezos?!  Are you freakin' kiddin' me?! Why is Jeff Bezos sending you packages? Do you even care there's a strike going on?! Bike parade?! You dad is part of the strike, you little shit!   I just thought you'd want to know the kind of people you're sellin' out for. It's Josh, man! He's gone missing!   Hey, the church is back open! There are people inside!  Oh boy! Let's go let's go let's go let's go! Satan's dead.  And with your spirit. Awww. Come on, guys.  There! There he is! There he is! It's either blood and cum, or ketchup and mayo.    Praise be to Christ. Should I bring out the Kumby? Yes, your Holiness. Aaaaugh! Aaaaugh!  Yaaay! Awww. There's something over here,  but I can't tell if it's cum or frosting. No, but this should draw him out. The cute one says it's where he and the priest first got together. He's not showing up.  I don't think he's coming. The Kumboni! Aaah!  Aaaaagh! Aah! I love Jeeesus! I love Jeeesus! Like a Catholic priest at a Chuck E. Cheese.  Is it over?! How hard what truly was?  People, it's time we faced some hard truths. The town is looking to us for answers, and all we keep doing is burying our heads. We need to cut the budget for this year's Christmas pageant. I've asked the director of the holiday show to stop by so we can all give him the news. Let's just get this over with.  Mr. Hankey, we called you in to let you know that... your Christmas Pageant funding has been cut. By half. We just don't have the support for the Christmas show that we used to. The truth is... some people find you offensive. The decision has already been made. Thank you, Mr. Hankey, and good luck with the show.  We need to talk about what you tweeted! No, I'm talking about what you tweeted last night!  "The city council members are a bunch of pussy-licking Islamists." I'm afraid we have no option but to fire you as executive planning manager of the city council. No goodbyes, Mr. Hankey. You just need to go. We already called you a Poober.  And how do YOU think we get that money? How do YOU suggest we do this? If he doesn't, we should just let him go. God knows it's about time. Some people think shit isn't the best representation of Christmas. Hey, a lot of people like him, all right? Yeah, and a lot of people think he stinks. Hooooowwwdy ho! You wanted to see me? Better hurry. We only have two months before Christmas. What? But I can barely make a good Christmas show with what I have! Offensive? What about me is offensive? Yuh... you people can't do this. Christmas is the most magical time of the year. Okay, stop. Kids, the song's called "Deck The Halls," not "Let's All Suck Balls." Mow, come on, kids. Restoration Hardware put up their Christmas decorations two weeks ago, all right? Now listen: I didn't want this either. I wanted the Denver Symphony, but they cut my budget and I'm stuck with you. Now let's take it from the top!  Oh, Kyle! Hoowwwwdy ho!  Yeah.  Yeah. It was a bad attempt at a joke. I'm sorry. Will you tell the kids I didn't mean it? The fact is, I couldn't sleep last night so I took some Ambien. Do you take that stuff? It turns your brain into oatmeal. Please, Kyle, tell the kids I didn't mean any harm. We've gotta focus on Christmas!  <poem><i>Christmas time. It's Christmas time. Christmas time. Yeah, it's Christmas time</i></poem>. Oh, I'm sooo sorry. I took Ambien two nights ago and I called the schoolkids homos. Oh-oh Jeez, did I say that? Listen, if you're tired and you can't sleep, DO NOT take Ambien. Okay? Whew! Fire me? Nonono, please. I-I'm really sorry.  My civil rights are under attack. They can't just fire me from the Christmas show! The whole thing is my creation! It was a joke. Look at me! I don't even have a dick! Get it?  Okay, okay, look, I know: it wasn't a good joke. But it really wasn't my fault. The fact is, I went home last night and I was angry. I couldn't sleep, so I took some Ambien. And then I started tweeting. Ambien messes with my head. You ever take that crap? Well, I thought maybe I could get them in a defecation lawsuit.  Rrrgh! And I never ever would have said those things about the city council, but the Ambien makes me kind of blackout. Why not?  Rrrgh! And I just thought maybe we could convince the city council to hire me back. Oh, Kyle.  Howwwdy ho. Just tryin' to find some help. There isn't a lawyer in town who will take me. Wait a minute... You! You're the son of a lawyer. You have lawyer blood inside your veins! You can help me with my defecation lawsuit, Kyle! Please, Kyle. You're the only person left who can help me. You and me, pal, we are gonna fight the system! Y-es. That was a bad attempt at a Christmas joke. That's what I said: it was a bad attempt. You wanna hear a good Christmas joke? Sorry, I got the sniffles. All I understand is it's only eight weeks until Christmas! If we don't stop wasting our time, we're all gonna miss out on the most magical part of the whole year! Oh, come on! It was a joke! That's it! That's it, I've had enough of this whole fucking sham! Fuck all you and fuck this whole system! It's Christmastime!!  Gee whiz. Thanks for comin' out with me, Kyle.  So what's the plan, huh? What you got figured out to get my job back?  Oh, it was a joke, Kyle. Sometimes, when I take Ambien, I'm really groggy and moody the next day. It's a real side effect. It's printed right on the bottle. Kyle, don't you understand this whole thing is a smear campaign? Why are people focusing on a few stupid words I said when Christmas is just around the corner?! It's like everyone's forgot about what Christmas means!  Oh my God! Kyle, that's it! The holiday spirit! And that's the point! Don't you see? What we need to do is get everyone in the Christmas mood! We can bring the whole spirit of the holidays early! Nonono. Kyle, you gotta help me! I can't do this alone! You're all I have! Even my wife left with the Nuggets 'cause of all the pressure! Please! Well, maybe just a little if I really can't sleep. Yay! It's a deal! Oh boy, Kyle, I'm so excited! We're gonna bring the spirit of Christmas to South Park! Helloooo South Park! Come on, everybody! Get over here!  The PC what-Listen! Christmas season means peace on earth and good will towards men!  What?! What are they crying about now?! Well, then tell the babies to shut the fuck up!  Who the fuck brings a Goddamned baby to a Christmas show, anyway?! Lemme go, Kyle! These people are idiots!  Kyle, listen. It was 3 a.m. last night and I still hadn't slept, so I de-  Kyle? Kyle, please! They're gonna run me out of town, Kyle! They're going to erase me and everything I ever did. Kyle, we can all be shitty sometimes. Well, everyone, I guess this is goodbye. It sure has been swell. A Poober? They have that?  Oh, you mean Lyft. Well, okay. Goodbye, everyone. I hope I brought a few smiles and a few laughs into your hearts. Hoowwwwdy ho! Yes, PC Principal? What would we need to discuss?! Hey! I am a strong woman, all right?! I don't get manipulated! We both are guilty of an ill-advised relationship at the workplace, but that was long ago, and I have decided to move forward. Why not? We make a mistake, we move forward. Nope! We're just gonna forget about it and put it to rest. No, I don't! Bye-bye.  That's right, kids. Many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives. They can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown person's sperm in a lab.  Ooohhhhhhh!  Oh! Ooohhhhhhh! I'm fine! That's my water breaking. Not a big deal.   I didn't need your help! Yeah, well, people might get the wrong idea! I have worked my whole life to be the strongest woman possible, a person little girls could look up to. If those girls thought I was the type to get knocked up by my boss- There's nothing to discuss! I made a mistake and I am MOVING FORWARD! My babies! Where are they? You shouldn't be here! People will start getting suspicious! Nobody took advantage of me! And I'm a strong woman! Oh yes, that curriculum should be fine for the students. I'll start working on an all-school proposal. It's okay. Shhh. We just need to get some diapers. Shhh. Thank you. Oh no, no, they're not very PC at all. They actually aren't PC. Oh God, shhhh, nonononono. Sheee. I told you we need to shop separately! Sh! Shhh! They're so PC, like... whoever their father is.  We did the most un-PC thing imaginable. Think about what that would do to them. We can never let them know the debaucherous, sickening circumstances that brought them into this world. And I'll be their strongest vice principal, and hopefully... the world will calm down and not do anything to upset them. Children, everyone, just stay back, okay? The police are coming. Oh thank God. Some kindergartners found the body. I-I don't think it was a shooting. Over there.   I could use a little help here! Riley said a word her sister felt was insensitive to Muslims. Now they're all upset. She just said "Aba daba." Oh, yeah. That would be really smart. If anybody sees them, they're gonna figure out you're the father. You wanna risk that? The babies have to stay hidden because if people know the truth, then you're not PC and I'm not strong!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Hey! What the fuck are you doing?! With a box on your head?! I don't need a box on my head to use the phone! All right, Riley. Give that back to your brother.  River?? Bailey?! Emory?! I can't believe you were on your phone! It was my time to be on the phone! You were on yours all morning! Yes!  Oh God, I'm not doing this again. No! No, we don't want to file anything specific. We just need help finding some PC babies. Nono, it's five specific PC babies. No! No, these PC babies wouldn't have gotten that far! They can barely walk. I'm their mother. Woman.  Strong. Don't be ridiculous! I'm not some two-bit floozy who goes around sleeping with her boss! I am a strong woman! Those kids were born naturally by in-vitro fertilization.  We'll uh, see what we can do. In the meantime you'll just have to take a seat and wait.   Riley? You're okay! Thank God!  I'm their... vice principal. They.... did all that? I've always used the phone as a way to deal with the stress of having babies nobody could know the truth about, but... it's only made it worse. Yeah, I think so.  I don't think anyone's listening to you. I guess we can wait and ban the boxes tomorrow?  Uh, last night you tweeted "The city council can suck my Mexican dick." You want us to take this up against Ambien? They have the best lawyers in the world. I'm sorry, sir, but we don't represent pieces of shit. Look, I'm sorry, but I learned a long time ago that if you defend poop, you get stained.  Aah! Aaaah! Here! Here, take it! Just take it!  What is it, Kyle? Hey, were my boxes there too? Jeff Bezos? The founder and CEO of Amazon? Well, can he find my packages too?  I don't really care. I just want my stuff. If I have to work at Amazon to get my packages, then so be it. Paging Dr. Bender. And now, live from the town courthouse, it's the Hankey Hearing on South Park 13.  Tegridy Weed, from Tegridy Farms. Made... with a little Colorado tegridy. Comin' soon to a dispensary near you. Your vice principal gave birth to all five babies with no epidural. I must say, she's a very strong woman. The quintuplets are all healthy and resting away.  There are her babies, right there. Yes, cute little buggers, aren't they? Three boys and two girls. Funny. That's exactly what their mother said.  The quints are all Caucasian, blue-eyed, and something kind of weird. Well, the babies are all extremely PC, the likes of which I have never seen. Watch this.  Oh I'm sorry. That's only for the mother and father. Though, according tot he vice principal, the father doesn't even exist.  A-hall right, Mommy! Your little bundles of joy are here. Oh! And who's this? No, not at all. Everything good here?  Mr. Hankey-  Fourteen hours ago did you or did you not say "everyone in South Park is a God-damned douchebag"? But there's nothing in that statement about Christmas. What part of the statement was actually- In 2005 you said-  Mr Hankey, do you understand how important these statements are to the citizens of this town? What did you mean last night when you tweeted, "The Mayor of South Park is a titless whore"?   Ohhh, what adorable little babies.  My, they look very PC. Awww, look at the PC babies! No?  Oh Look! More PC babies! Shhh! Quiet! There's PC babies! They're everywhere! No, I know. They said the workers are still on strike. They don't know when our orders-   No, that's a bad dog, Banjo! Bad dog!  Oho, look at the little PC babies! I know a PC baby when I see one!  Oohhhhh! Hooray!  All right! ...Ohhhhh. <poem><i>PC Babies</i></poem> <poem><i>PC Babies</i></poem> Hey! Hey, careful! You're upsetting the PC babies!  Ex-excuse me. Could I buy some weed? Yeah it's this stupid Amazon strike. None of my orders are getting fulfilled, and I just need something to take the edge off. Sometimes PC babies don't even know what they're crying about.  Hey, are you selling weed?  My wife is going nuts not getting her packages. I told her I'd find her some kush.  Well why don't you guys get back to work so we can get our packages? Mommy, something stinks.  Wow. Yeah, like shit.   You stand up for all pieces of crap?! Asshole! Hey, could you sell me more than an ounce? No, it's fine. I'll just go over to the Anderson Weed Farm and buy more there. It's a long way to drive out here. Need to make it worth my while.  But it's Christmas. It's Christmas and we've no presents, no decorations. And there's no one who can help us.  Today... South Park says goodbye to Mr. Hankey. The longtime union of this town and the holiday figure... is over for good. We should all feel pretty great about ourselves, give ourselves a little, nice pat on the back, as we, as a society, continue to try and sweep away all the poop.  Cool man, talking crap. Welcome, my friend. Please, rest your weary feet and make yourself at home here.  Hey, the light's green!  Vroom, vroom. I am a truck!  I like raspberry. It's mine! It's mine! I got it! I get it!   Watch out for the monster.  Yeah, I like lemon flavor. Do you know how hard it is being a kindergartner? We need a break sometimes.  Hey, gimme back my vaporizer!  Oh, come on! All the kids are doing it.  Doin' good, neighbor! Just planted some Purple Skunky Kush. Harvested the Super Hindu Haze last week. Well, see ya 'round, neighbor! Oh, hey Randy. We uh, we sold the farm. Yeah. They paid us great. My wife and I are gonna move to Maui! Yes, I'm with the State testin' board? Is this uh,...  Tegridy Farms?  Let's test it out.  Whoa. Whoa. I don't know what Tegridy is, but... that is some good shit!  Ah I-I didn't know chickens wore suspenders. Vape on this, bitch!  Yupper. We got a lot of work to do. We can't let 'em take what makes us special.  We need to find a way to get the weed to the people. You know what they got? They got these e-scooters nowadays. What if we use e-scooters to get the weed directly to the customers? Hello, sir. I have your weed delivery. There you are, ma'am.  Enjoy your Tegridy. We're here to please the customer!  Hello, sir. I have your weed delivery.  Hello, sir. I'm with the Tegridy Weed Company. We're just makin' sure folks are aware of our new rewards program. We now have three levels of membership for our weed. There's Tegridy, Tegridy Plus, and Tegridy Elite. But you don't want to be elite, 'cause elite's got no Tegridy.  Is this Teh-gridy Farms? Our company is interested in your product. We'd like to do some business with you. We're one of the top vape companies in the state. We'd like to add your product to our line. Pussy sticks? You got a problem with vaping? It's cleaner and healthier than traditional smoking! All right.  You can be a part of progress or you can get run over by it. What happened to your accent?  What are you kids doing? You little hoodlums break in through the window?! I oughtta break your little legs! Didn't your mommy teach you it doesn't pay to mess with progress?! Okay, what is it regarding? Right through there. You're second in line.  Mr. Principal? The vice principal needs to speak with you. She says it's urgent.  Oh yeah! I'm here to offer my fun, fruity flavors in a refreshing mist.  Oh yeah! Hey bitches! Where's my motherfuckin' money?! There you go, and thanks for shoppin' at Big Vape.  There you are. You got my money? Who are you?  Look, I'm just filling a job that somebody else would fill, all right?  Aw, come on, man. I don't wanna take your birthday money.  What? You just put that dead hooker there.  Ow! Tegridy? What's tegridy?  Hey! I like to vape. You think I'm a pussy? Ow!  October was always my favorite month.  But this Halloween was different, and it would change us all... forever. It was the day before Halloween. All of our parents were gathered together to try and stop a nightmare from coming true. And just like that, it was over. Nobody knew what happened. They only knew their phones didn't work. No scooters, no texting, not even GPS. It was like the old Halloween.  Mr. Mackey was able to get back to the town and offer counseling to everyone who needed it.  And as for me? I was able to spend the rest of the night with my friends, because we were all equal again. It was the last Halloween that still felt like Halloween. It was the last time... it was good.   It isn't anybody's. They're e-scooters. Anyone can use them. Yeah, see? There's a bunch here and a bunch more down there.  Everyone can use them to get around town, you know? Leave them where they want for the next person.  E-scooters? Well where the hell do they all come from?!  Well I'm just gettin' my Halloween candy. Want to make sure I get enough. Last year I ran out and the kids egged my house, m'kay? I'll take three large bags each of Snickers Fun Size, Payday Bite Size, Almand Joy Snack Size, and Reese's Teenie Weenie Size, m'kay? Hey, c-can, can I ask you somethin'? Wha, what's up with all these damn scooters? No, but like, where did they come from? You know, it's like one day everything was fine, and the next there were these fuckin' scooters everywhere.  I just think people should drive, m'kay? I don't think people should "scoot." I just... I just hope the future isn't "scootin'."  Hey! What the hell?!  God damn it! Get off the goddamned street with those things!  Woh, fuck me! God damnit, where'd you get that?!  And now tricks or treats is here! Well I'll tell you one thing! I'm not gonna let my house get egged this year for not havin' enough candy! So what are we gonna do?! Get-whoa-get out of the way!  What did you-? Get me some of those Hi-Chews. Well then let me, let me have the Whatchamacallits? Look, you've gotta give me some more fuckin' candy!  Where, where's the candy, m'kay? Candy?  Uhh, what aisle is the candy in?   What you want? Wait. Are you here for counseling? Do you realize it's about to be World War III out there?! We have bigger problems! Consider yourself lucky, M'kay?! Everyone's gonna be scootin' and there's no way to stop it. Why are you the one kid who doesn't want to use them? What do you mean? You can't use those things without a phone? But Kenny, if that's true, then... could there be a way to cut the connection? Jesus! You really think that could work?!  The tower should be just over that ridge. What gives them the right, huh? I mean, some big company came and dumped a bunch of scooters everywhere without asking anyone if it was okay. Yeah, you're right. You're a good kid, Kenny. I always thought so. I know we kind of all forget about you sometimes, but you're smart, compassionate, and you might even make a good counselor someday.  Okay, sounds good!  Jesus Christ!  We're not here for tricks or treats! That's why he has to take down this cellphone tower: To stop the scooters! Jason, I'm a counselor. You need to trust me.  All right, Kenny!   Thank you, 'kay. Uh, Mr. Hankey did somethin' bad, and we were forced to make him uh... leave. Forever. How can I help you? Yeah, you don't wanna run out of candy on Halloween. Sounds like you wanna be prepared.  Oh, I think you get an app on your phone and you can use them all over town. You don't like scooters?  Well, they seem pretty convenient.  Look, I got nothin' left, all right? Those are already accounted for by folks who called in! Those are for me! I've gotta protect my own house! There's nothin' left here. You've gotta go somewhere else!   Sorry.  Sorry. Sorry dude.  Sorry.  Sorry bro.  Sorry, dude. Sh sh-sh-sh-sh Shi sh-shi shit. Hey wait! That's what we're doing! Butters? We've lost Butters! Agh!  Sorry, dude. Oh, they're all over, dude. Super-convenient. Try it out.  You wanna trick or treat with us? Why? Oh, you jerks found out the girls are all trick or treating on e-scooters, and you stole our idea!  All right, everyone. Quiet, please. We have a community crisis on our hands, and it's my job to keep you informed. As you know, there's been a rise in the use of e-scooters in our town. Officer Brown is head of crisis control. Officer? We have inside information that kids everywhere are going to be using e-scooters for tricks or treats. Now, with these things, kids and teens can cover a lot of ground in very little time. They can hit more houses than ever before. Because of the scooters, we also expect that people from all the neighboring counties will commute for tricks or treats in our town. Because of all of this, we believe each household needs to be prepared... with at least $6,000 worth of candy. Yeah! That's right! Let's do it! Uh, aisle 7.  OH GOD! WE NEED MORE THREEM MUSKETEERS! WE CAN'T BE OUT! THERE HAS TO BE MORE!! We really didn't have a choice. Since the fulfillment center opened, me and my wife's coffee business has gone belly-up.  They're closed. We're all closed. Our coffee shop -- everything. Yeah. Well, when the Amazon Fulfillment Center opened, everything else went out of business.  Oof, Sorry. Sorry, dude. I'm all out of candy, all right?! Go look somewhere else! Yeah, sure! That's what the last people said! Then they dumped my entire bowl in a pillowcase! I'm just a security guard, all right?!  We never even used to have trick-or-treaters out this far! There's a bowl of Rice Krispie treats at the side door! The side door, you animals! All right. We have some dead cows down at Milner's Ranch. I want Conners and Tiggs to check that out. And the two hikers are still missing. Let's have all units keep their ears to the ground.  All right, ladies, that's it. Second shift starts now. As for me, I'm finally heading home. Yep. Gonna go home and play me some Red Dead Redemption 2. I got a train to rob in Valentine. No, no not another school shooting! Can't they handle it themselves?   All right, what happened? What grade was the shooter in?  Jesus, it's a complete mauling.  Come on. I don't have time for these little games. Which of you peckers felt isolated and lashed out at society? If I have to stay here and do an investigation instead of go home and rob a train, there's gonna be serious hell to pay! Take a seat, boys. Right there.  Shut up! now, which one of you had a beef with Colin Brooks?! Oh yeah? I asked the kids in this school, "Who are the biggest loners? Who's most likely to rage and be the next school shooter?" You know what they said? The fat, ugly mean kid and the detached, loner poor kid. Or was it both of you? Fess up. I have people in Horseshoe Overlook who are depending on me to get provisions so we can head back east. That's right. And I'm gonna make both of you school shooters pay for wasting my time.  In my report, you'll see that Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick are believed to have worked together. I've issued warrants for their arrests, and this case is now in the hands of the DA.  Whaaat? In the woods? There was a school shooting out in the woods? Outside of school is the one place kids are supposed to be safe. I don't believe it. A school shooting at an ice cream shop. Damn it! When children leave school they're supposed to be out of harm's way! I would be too if I were guilty. So we got us a gang of shooters, huh?! How the hell hard can it be to find four boys?! Erh. Huh. Gotta admit I've to love to see the sunrise over Citadel Rock again. And I got me a gal who claims she's got a side mission or two. Another school shooting, Maggie. Down at Baskin-Robbins.  Maggie, I just need to relax a bit, all right? Please. I've been waiting for this a long time. Just give me a- Wait a minute. The house in Valentine is built? Where did I get a sniper rifle? Maggie! Did you play over my saved game? A little bit, you-? On my saved game?! Why didn't you start your own?!  That's my life, Maggie! I was goin' for more honor points! God damn it! I haven't gotten to play in three days. You've done all this stuff without me! You got deputized?!  Oh God damn it! That does it! I'm starting a new life!  I'm creating a new saved game. What choice do I have now?!  Fuckin' bitch. Do you all have any idea what it's like to start over?! You walk four hours through the snow relearning everything, all because your bitch wife went and spent all your hard-earned money on upgrades you didn't want! I get one little break from work - one little break - and I didn't even get back to the first brawl at the saloon!  SHUT UP!! These school shootings are done, you hear me?! I want this case closed by the end of the night, one way or another! Now let's MOVE OUT! Attention school shooters! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!   That's it, gentlemen! Case closed. Now I've got a Goddamned stagecoach to rob in Scarlett Meadows! Oh no, that's fine.  God damn it! There's no such thing as a ManBearPig!  You got that?? We're working with facts here, not goofball theories! Fuck scientists!  Why are you trying to figure out what's going with scientists?! The only thing I want to know is who committed this school shooting, since our school-shooting suspects are in jail! Oh well, there you go! It was them again! Gee, I didn't need any freakin' scientists to figure that out, did I?! Get 'em outta here!  Now how the fuck did those kids break out of my jail?!  You'd better start from the beginning. Oh, you'd better not-  You're playing Red Dead Redemption, aren't you?! What did I tell you about playing on my saved game, Maggie?! What are you talking about?!  You fucking slut! Don't you talk to me like that! Found them where?! Maggie!  Nwaaahahahahaha... Belay those orders!  We're nothing if we don't believe in each other! And Goddamnit, it's never too late to start trying to do the right thing. You think you know what that is, boys? Detective, look! We are two hours ahead here! New York has completely run out of candy!   And I can't get an Uber home!  Trick or treat. Mn-thanks. I thought so too. Mmm-no I have not, Jimbo. I'm scared.  Mmm-I'm getting my white ass outta here.   Gonna finally get some R&R, sir? Detective!  Detective, we just got word from the station. The four shooting suspects broke out a while ago. Jenkins said they tricked him. Said they could show him a way to fast-travel in Red Dead Redemption by upgrading his camp, and then they just took off. Detective! Got a call from the school. Another kid's been killed. Said they need us right away. Detective! There's more dead kids. Out in the woods by Stark's Pond. They're saying it's really bad, sir. Need all units. What the hell?   Looks like part of him was eaten.  No witnesses to the attack were left alive. The same bear and pig droppings were found along with human excrement. Sir. Why don't you take a break, sir? You've been hittin' it hard. We'll do all we can to catch these kids. Go home. Play some Red Dead Redemption. Go on home, sir. We'll take care of everything here.  If these kids don't stop killing each other, I'm gonna shoot 'em all myself. Al Gore... Al Gore... Sounds familiar. Ohhh yeahhh. This looks like Jim Turner The state bowling champion five years in a row. You can always catch him practicing down at Gramercy Lanes. Focus. Calm. Center.  Yes! Die! Die, you pins! Oh, we've got a straggler, do we? You're gonna die just like the rest of 'em. Focus. Calm.  That's a name I haven't heard in a long time. Oh. Sucks for you.   Oh, is it inconvenient now? I tried to warn you all, but no one took me cereal. You all just made fun of me, didn't you? Well, now you can just deal with it yourselves. You stop it all those years ago when I freaking warned you and you still had time! Say you're sorry for making fun of me. Say you're sorry for making fun of me. That... didn't sound cereal at all.  Aw, thanks, guys! You shouldn't have! What did you guys get me?  Hang on!  Who said anything about stopping MBP? Yeah, to make up for ripping on me! I've moved on from this life, okay?! I have a new life now! I'm a bowler!They're my family now! We're wanted in Blackwater, and we have to move our camp soon! Yeah, it's amazing. Only thing is I have all these stolen items and I don't know how to sell them.  This is it. Every piece of information I ever gathered on ManBearPig.  Hoho! I thought that once too. I wanted to find ManBearPig's origins. And so I created this - the Internet. With that, I was able to look everywhere for any bit of data, and what I learned is that ManBearPig... is a demon.  Oh my God. I should play Red Dead on this computer, with all three screens. That'd be so bitchin' sweet. Why does the Devil do anything? He's the freakin' Devil. He's a dick.  All I can say is... you boys better get to the grocery store, 'cause it's time... to get cereal. Abuul abash mayah. What Satan has put forth upon this earth, may it be summoned and banished forever.  We call upon the powers of darkness. Come on, guys. We call upon the powers of darkness. Al Gore was right. Al Gore was right all along. We should have listened to Al Gore. It's Instagram Live. Keep going! We should have taken Al Gore more cereal.  You were saying? Here he comes, boys! Prepare yourselves!  Yeah, no doi! What'd ya think we were doing?!  Prince of Darkness! It is I, Al Gore! I was almost President! A demon from Hell has been unleashed upon our world! We demand to know its nature! We demand to know its reason for coming! Ah! You are correct.  Your local library is an excellent resource for whatever you wish to learn. Then I command ye, Satan, to come with us to the local library! And I am cereal! You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? No. They don't listen to me, kids.  You must convince people there's a ManBearPig, which Satan told you is a Fate Sifter demon that made a deal with someone in this town! Yeah, sounds really hard, doesn't it? People might not believe you and like, make fun of you and stuff. Poor you guys, huh?   Fear not. Do not give up on yourself. You must keep believing. It's me. Al Gore. You cannot lose faith, my child, even though everyone is ripping on you. Even though they don't believe you and they're saying you're just seeking attention because you lost the Presidency. You have to be strong! No! not dead! Just merely using a flashlight on the glass to apply the Pepper's ghost technique. You see my point? Things aren't always as they appear. You have to stay strong, my little crusader. I did, too. Didn't get it.  What's that? See you later, alligator.  Oh yeah, you're real cereal.  All I was doing was trying to be your mentor. You know who my mentor was? Me! Al Gore!  And in conclusion, let me just say that you are the future. You cannot give up hope. I brought you all together because I believe in you. Did you guys like my movie? Exactly. I'm trying to get you to ask "What would Al Gore do?" Yes, to get you all to not give up. To get you to fight!  Hey, what are you doing? No, they're depending on me! I'm depending on you, goofball! You can't just go along with what people are saying, Susan. Okay? There's no scientific proof, no real evidence of a Manbearpig. Yeah, and a lot of smarter people saying saying it isn't. Okay? What you need to understand, Susan, is that everyone has an agenda. Everyone wants to use the fear of a Manbearpig to get what they want.  But you have to use your own brain, sweetheart. You can't just let people tell you that if you don't believe in ManBearPig, then you don't care about the world. You wanna believe it's real? You go right on ahead, Susan. Okay, ManBearPig is real.  What are we gonna do that's gonna make any difference now, Susan? What can we do that everyone else will also do, Susan?  This is a new beginning for us, darling. I'm just so excited for our future.  Babe, can you please come say hi to my mother while she's here?  Well, there's a lot of smart people saying ManBearPig is real. It is real! No, it's right there! It's right there behind you!   What?! We have to do something! Detective! Sir, we got word on the two suspects. They appear to be on the run. No one has seen them or their two closest friends, uh, Marsh and Broflovski. Harrison Yates, where have ya been?! I haven't seen ya in days. I've missed you so much. Come have some supper with me. I just played a little bit. You're never home anymore! With all these school shootings! I need a life too, you know?! ISo I robbed a lumber mill in Monto's rest, upgraded my horse and got a sniper rifle. Why can't we have a life together?! Where are ya going?! You can;t possibly go all the way back to the snow level again!  So what of it?! No! No, this is my life now, Harrison Yates! I started over, with me own saved game! See for yourself. I built a house with John Marston! I'm helpin' his family now!  A basic starter horse and the $20 gambler's that you won at a poker match! I'm twice the man you are now! I'll talk however I want!  I'm not tellin'! You wanted your now life and now you got it!  We call upon the powers of darkness. Al Gore was right all along. We should have all listened to Al Gore.  You can actually bypass that fight if you go hunting with Dutch. They're coming out! Who hath summoned me to this realm?! What do you wish of me, Al Gore?! There is only one place you can find the answers you seek! It is the place where all knowledge becomes known. Your local library. Yes it is. Very well, Al Gore. Let us go! Yeah, guys! Guys, over here! I think I found it. What you're dealing with is a Sifter of Fate. So there's these demons that, um, actually come once every few generations. They're all about making deals. Yeah, check it out: "The Sifter of Fate thrives on tempting mankind. It will always offer a deal in exchange for mercy, but the carnage will be a thousand times worse when the debt comes due." Now it's here to claim its part of the bargain. It's sort of like when you're part of a gang feuding with a rival gang, you know? You ride around on your horse thinking it won't all catch up with you, but... it always does. So good, right?  Rroooowwwwwrrrrr!!  Foolish mortals! Your time is nigh! Face your end! I was told to come here by the spirit of Al Gore.  A deal was made. We do not know by whom. But this demon has grown stronger, and no mortal can do anything to stop it. Why would I help mankind?  I... must admit, people up here on Earth have been doing a lot of my work for me lately. Maybe... maybe it is time I did something for them.   I'm sorry. Everyone dies. I just wish I could have helped you.  Oh God, it hurts. You have to. You have to keep trying. You have to keep trying!!   Goodbye. Hands where we can see 'em! Well done, sir!   Billy... What have I done? Oh, Billy.  My grandson come to visit. Billy, I have Alzheimer's. I don't even remember what happened this morning. Aw, great! Just tell the whole world, Margaret!  We had a right to be happy too, you know?! We didn't want to have to give the demon his stuff back! All our cars , and premium boutique ice cream.  This creature shows up, and it seemed like a good deal for everyone in town.  Aw Billy, it's not that simple. We thought about it. But our town was so tiny back then. We just, we wanted nice things other people had. I didn't think I'd have grandkids. I didn't even want children. That's why I always came on Gram Gram's tits. But then, one night, I'm having sex with your grandma, and she sticks her finger in my ass. She had sometimes licked my ass before,  I pulled out and your grandma was like "Did you just come in me?", and I was like "Well, you stuck your finger in my ass." And that's basically why you're here, Billy. I'm just saying that I wasn't thinking about the future because your father was supposed to be nothing but dried-up crust on Gram Gram's titties. It doesn't matter, Billy. It's too late now.  Everyone's greedy!  Yeah, I thought so.   Oh my gosh! Oh, honey! I can't believe you went to Jared!  You want a piece of this, you god damn pigs?!  Yeah, that's the last cop. Let's get out of here!  Oh God. Here we go again. "We gotta stop ManBearPig! We gotta take it serious!" Oh, well then I guess I don't have to do anything about it. Shut up! I don't wanna hear anything about ManBearPig and how we're all doomed.   What the hell are you talking about? All right, everyone. I realize a lot of people have died and most of the roads have been destroyed due to all the fires, so I'd like to thank you all for coming to tonight's symposium, "When Should I Start To Worry?"  I'd like to make this an open discussion and hope we can all participate in ways that give us better insight. Yes, Mr. Clarkson? That's an excellent question. There's definitely evidence that all the death and destruction around us is due to a ManBearPig. Definitely not, and that's why we're all here, to pinpoint, "When Should I Start To Worry?" I think Stephen echoes a lot of our feelings right now. And now, on Park County Public access, "Should We Start To Worry?" with your host, Jim Kimble.   Hello, Al Gore. Remember... even though I am gone, you must still work together. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the ones who are actually cereal.  You cannot lose hope. There is still much you need to know. And sometimes, believing is all that we need to be cereal.  Make a movie starring you. If by worrying you mean getting cereal, then an empathic "YES." I'm being a spiritual mentor. These people are depending on me. Sorry to call you down, sir, but this is a bad one. This one really doesn't look like a school shooting, sir. Five different witnesses say it was definitely... ManBearPig. Yea, but sir, all the forensic scientists say there are bear and pig footprints- We thought we'd be dead by now. We didn't think we'd have to live to see the consequences. As our town continues to burn to the ground, Satan has been slaughtered and sent to Heaven. Should we start to worry? Joining me now, an expert on our county resources and preparedness, Alec Vaughn. Alec, should we start to worry? Also joining us is the former Vice-President, Al Gore. Mr. Gore, do you think it's time for us to deliberate the process of starting to worry? Jim, I think we should definitely consider starting to worry. Satan was one of the most powerful entities, supposedly, in the universe, and ManBearPig annihilated him like a bitch. I don't think we should waste any more time underestimating the importance of beginning to think about starting to worry. I don't think there's any more room for not considering underestimating the importance of beginning to start the process of mulling over the conceptualization of starting to worry. And the time to do it is... very soon. Attention school shooters... again.  We have you surrounded... again. Come out with your hands up! Drop to the ground and put your hands on your heads! We have orders! You're coming with us! Okay,  These documents state merely that you've been granted power of attorney by your town and that you wish to attempt to void the current agreement. Since this is a renegotiation,  Uh, let me confer with my client.  Uh, mm-hmm. ManBearPig has no interest in you giving up cars and ice cream. All right, sign here and here  Right there. And sign here that ManBearPig has rights to the lives of all the children in Third World countries. And you agree to ignore ManBearPig until he returns in five years, in which time the carnage will be a thousand-fold. ...Just plain rice?  Eric, I just feel like you have so much to offer the world, and it kills me that you're so afraid to let your inner you shine. Mornin' hon. I don't think anyone's getting packages, sweetie. Look.   What would you like, sir? Hey, could you turn your phone down, kid? This is a restaurant. Oh, hello, Eric. Hey kid!  Hey kid! You're about to get hit by a car!  We live in a world of many distractions. It's hard to find peace. In the hustle and bustle of modern times, we've lost the one thing we all need. . More quality one-on-one time with our phone.

I want to be enlightened, like the Buddha, but I've got these fucking kids. All right, children, we have a lot to go over for today's quiz. Who can tell me where we left off?  Eric Cartman. You aren't using this during class time. <poem><i>They're comin' to your town</i></poem> Hey Mike. What's that you're drinking? Oh, there's some PC babies upset about certain drink descriptions. Who's makin' a difference? Who's the future?  This? Oh, it's a Cosmopolitan. I know, I know, it's a pussy drink.  Oh great. Come on, I didn't mean pussy drink as in female genitalia.   Hey, what's all that racket down there?! Fine, we'll take them off the menu. Amazon, Amazon light, and Amazon IPA. I just feel that Craig has changed so much lately! He barely even talks to me anymore! Hey! Hey, what's goin' on here?! Why aren't you people workin'?! Protesters? Who? All right, all right! What do you PC babies want?  Aw, come on PC Babies! Why does that matter?!  God damnit, not everyone cares about race-relation programs! Come on, PC Babies! We got a job to do!  We can't keep buildin', sir. We got a bunch of protesters who won't let us work. Ah, it's just a bunch of PC babies who think building this thing is wrong.  I guess they're upset because the new viaduct is being financed by a state rather than a county institution. I guess the state refused to finance a proposed program on race-relation education, an they see it as hypocritical. All right, all right, just calm down, lady! You want to file a missing persons report? PC babies? They usually hang out at the liberal arts colleges. You could find some there. Tony, wasn't there a report of some PC babies down at the Mexican border? Hokay, okay. Last name? First name? Okay, and you're the father?  It's the PC Babies. Guess they're all the rage now. NO! You know what the kids like today? They like music that matters! I think you guys got what it takes to be the next big thing! The PC Babies!  That's what I'm talkin' about! That stuff is raw! Everyone loves you, PC Babies! We're gonna make you famous! That was far out, PC Babies! You really rocked the airwaves! Now come on! We got a photo shoot at 5!  Who the hell are you?? You can't do that! These are the PC Babies! Don't you know how big they are?! In just one day they protested a bar, stopped construction of a problematic viaduct, and wrote a hit single about cultural appropriation! All right, PC Babies, let's hear what you got.  All right, South Park, and now here's that special treat we told you about. Live with us in the studio is a hot new band: The PC Babies. They're gonna perform their new song, which is about the injustice of white people in dreadlocks. It's called "Weeaaagh."  Continuing with non-stop holiday music. Here's a song from that hot new group, The PC Babies. It's a song about how the idea of Mrs. Claus perpetuates female stereotypes. It's called, "Jingle All The Waahhhh."  Na-ma-ste.  Gotta get down factory before the bell!  What the fook are we doin', anyway? Breakin' our backs! Loadin' up forklifts! Gettin' paper cuts from boxes! And for what?! A measly paycheck that just barely covers our online purchases. We had our dignity! It was the bloody machines! Ya can't do it, Stotch! Ya damned us all! If those orders get fulfilled, then we got nothin'! My son's in the bike parade too!  He's got... little tassels off the back of his seat. Tiny flags stickin' out the handlebars. But he deserves more, Stotch! If we don't make our stand now, he doesn't have a chance. He'll get fookin' third or fourth place or just a fookin' participation ribbon! Stotch! And if others try to break through the picket line? Hey, Stotch!  Yeah, I'm pretty excited, I guess. Yeah, I'm thinkin' about it.  Yeah, it's this Saturday. Everyone's gonna watch. You girls should come check it out. Yeah, it's gonna be a pretty nice bike parade, I suppose. Uh, y-you girls check out the flag on the back of my bike? They, they're silk. Every year, I win the bike parade. It's the one thing I care about. Now there's kids out there who have better bikes than me because you won't get off your ass and work, Dad! All I understand is that you suck!  Wow! Hey, nice bike, Larry. Are you gonna be in the bike parade? Howdy, folks. Aaaarargargar! You know, Tom, I think something like this was bound to happen. There's those at the top who control the means of production, and then there's the working class that enables those means by selling their labor power for wages. When there's conflict, the ruling class tries to blame the working class. No, my organs have been compacted, so if the box opens, I spill out and die. I believe the working class needs to revolt against capitalism and bring about socioeconomic emancipation. At what cost, sir?! Do you care that personal worth is being reduced by capitalists to exchange value?! Free trade is not free-dom! Perhaps socialism IS the answer! The history of this world... is the history of class struggles. Alienated from the products of their labor... from their fellow laborers and from their very essence. The oppressed worker will eventually strike back at those capitalists who control the means of production. We have nothing to lose but our chains. We will unite in revolution.  Nothing else can be allowed into the fulfillment center, no matter what the cost. Then follow me to Hell. They're going well, Tom. Thank you. You know, what happened to me could happen to any worker at a fulfillment center. I'm speaking to Congress here and then heading back to Colorado tomorrow via UPS. How is the common worker kept submissive? By the institutions and the ideology of the bourgeoisie. We only ask for compassion, for a fair share of the fruits of our labors.   Yeah. You're Jeff Bezos. This isn't about revenge, Bezos. It's about the production of too many useful things resulting in too many useless people! Damn you! You made everything nice and convenient, didn't you, Bezos?! But humans are more than consumers!  What are you gonna do to me? Oh my God...  We got another one! Who do they think they are?! It's not shuttin' down.  We'll do it for Josh, and so what happened to him never happens to anyone else.! We're ready to follow you, Josh. The Amazon Fulfillment Center has been shut down as hundreds of employees refuse to work.  And Josh, how does it feel to have your accident spark so much upheaval? Can you get out of the box? Do you get hot in the box?   Angry customers who wish to be fulfilled. The customers say the boxers need to return to work because the shutdown is hurting everyone.  If you pay for shipping, can you go anywhere you want?  Josh Carter is an Amazon employee who suffered a horrific workplace accident. In order to drum up support for the strike, he's recently FedExed himself to Washington.  How are things going, Josh? Meanwhile, Amazon says it's training new workers to replace the strikers. However, because the workers previously worked at a mall, they've had no human contact for quite some time.  Mayor, you have a visitor.  Jeff Bezos.  Yeah. Right on through here, Mr. Bezos.  Not now, I'm having problems!  Founder and CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos? Okay, okay, uh, let him in.  How have you been? Oh, thank you.  I guess you're here because of the... strike. And it has been. It it gave so many people jobs.  And I'm not really sure why everyone is so...  Please! I-I'm trying to get everyone back to work. I-I'm going to do everything that I can. They're... prideful people, yes. I didn't think it was relevant.  I thought the fulfillment center would be nothing but great for the town. Instead it's... it's buried us. We... We had to get rid of Mr. Hankey. No. He um.. he tweeted some uh... inappropriate things.  I wish I was doing better. Please Mayor, have a seat. We had a deal, Mayor. You told me this town would be the perfect place for one of our fulfillment centers.  It makes YOU look very bad. Perhaps... you should no longer be a Prime member. Then we have an understanding.  See how the worker begins to question his determination? Without his Amazon Prime Status, he fluctuates between being and non-being. Now... torn between memberships, the consumer-worker will reason that the strike is pointless. Prepare a bus. We must make sure that boxers who wish to box have a safe way into the fulfillment center. It is... not as I expected. Only one consumer worker broke through the picket lines. Your townspeople are more stubborn than I thought. Perhaps I should give up. How I long to return to Bezos and touch butts with my wife.  Amazon Fulfillment Center.  Yes, yes, the workers are striking. We're fucking working on it!  Is that so? Now those fools will pay!  Uh no, sorry, um... you say you have worker-consumers? willing to box? Very well. Stay right where you are.  You didn't tell me there was a bike parade. Everything is relevant when it comes to customers.  Your townspeople are beginning to learn that cooperation is rewarded by fulfillment. Now there's only one true enemy who stands in our way. Tonight he's giving a talk on Marxist theory. Do you know who I am? And you are Josh, former Amazon employee who suffered a workplace accident. You were wrongly packaged into a box, and now, if anyone tries to open it, your insides will burst apart. So you seek revenge. See how the box ridicules commercialism in order to try and feel better about itself. That's very eloquent... for a box--  A box that is the last thing standing in the way of real economic progress for this town. I'm not going to do anything to you. Alexa, go ahead. Sent them in. Hello, children. Uncle Jeff has a surprise for you! Who wants a special present for the bike parade?! Whoever opens the box gets what's inside!  Heheh.  What's the matter? Afraid you wouldn't win? The bike parade was quite useful to me. You see, people will do anything to have fulfillment. They finally realized the only way to get it would be to all work for the fulfillment center. Oh, you mean your little socialist friend? Yes, he's starting to rattle his sword now, too. Alexa, kill Kenny.  Don't you see I'm trying to help? Before, there was war between classes, customers and workers at odds. All I've done is create the new class: the consumer-worker. The future. Right now your parents, your teachers, everyone you know are showing up to work at the fulfillment center, and I'm afraid you are all going to lose the bike parade.  Are you all high? Because I'm over here! NO!   Welcome to Wiener On A Stick. There are many, and yet none.   Why have you come to this place?   Our purpose.  Sample of lotion?  Why, it's lemongrass lavender. Ohhh! Bike parade? Bike parade? Ohh! Ohhh! Bike parade!  That's nice! So... do you need... SHOES?  It is... our purpose. Aww! Our purpose.  Please! You are the only customers we've had the pleasure of assisting since the fulfillment center opened. We want our stuff! We want our stuff!  Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs!  Alexa, can I have my stuff shipped from a different ful-?   Hey man, we're about to go spend a day in the picket line. Can you sell us some weed?  Hey, fuck you buddy! This isn't very fulfilling.  Hmph!  It might be!  Oh, that's mine. Get your own.  Here come the temp workers! Scabs! Yeah! Okay.  Okay. I'll kill Kenny for you. Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!...  Son's right. Picket line or not, I'm gonna cross it, right now!  Oh, my weed. Forgot I ordered that. Where are you going?  Look!  Ho ho ho ho!  I heard some people here might need a little Christmas magic. Well, that's no problem for the hometown of my favorite holiday poo! Where is Mr. Hankey?  Where is that old bundle of Christmas cheer?  Got rid of him? Jesus, what did he do? Fuck a kid?  Merry Christmas! Have fun sucking Jeff Bezos' dick, you bunch of cunts!  It's Santa!  It's a miracle! It's only a couple of weeks until Christmas, and we don't have any presents! Christ, the savior, is born...   No, no...
