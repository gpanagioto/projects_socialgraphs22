I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.  Oops. A road? Hey, Kenny. They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates. "Pirate ghost" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate. No. It makes them ghost pirates. Hey, I got an idea.  We should set a groovy trap. We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll. Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas.  When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.  Jonathan, no! Hold on, guys!  David! You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them! Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts.
