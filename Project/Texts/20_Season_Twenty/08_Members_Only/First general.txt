Sir, we need you at the Pentagon. It's a matter of national security. Sir, the Danish have released a statement. I'm afraid... we may be going to war.  This way, please. Yes, sir. Here are all  our military secrets and all classified information.  In here is satellite surveillance where you can monitor anyone's conversation live. Extreme interrogation  room in case you find interrogation necessary.   This is everything you need to know about the TROLL TRACE program. A plan by the Danish to release the full internet histories of everyone on Earth. The entire world has become very uncertain and unstable. Because when the Chinese are able to see all our e-mails and online activity, we believe they will most likely attack us. Also, there are ground troops mobilizing in Paris because the French believe when we see all their e-mails, we will most likely attack them. Sir, it's the UK Secretary of Foreign Affairs calling from London. He says they have advice for you.
