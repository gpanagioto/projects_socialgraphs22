You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep. Oops, busted.  Aw, crap, there's more of them? You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!  Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him. Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey! So what?! That makes ''you'' from Jersey!  Let's just get away from him. Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three! You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!  Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to ''look'' like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange! Yes, it is. It's getting oranger. Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a ''lot'' more! What the hell are you guys doing?!  And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy! Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?! Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!  Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?! So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open. I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now! This is ''very'' serious, Butters. Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up. Come on, you guys, hurry! I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out. Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle! Nuh-uh. Seriously, nuh-uh. Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!   Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. ''[rushes up to the freezer door] ''Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted. Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?! You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!  Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me? What does it want?! No! You guys, it's raping me! ''It's raping me!''  Thank you, Kyle. Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
