Wrestling is awesome! Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this. Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names? Cool! Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?! I'll kill you, ''Triceratops''! You made fun of my crippled mother! Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene! Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me! If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here? Irene, no! Why? Good thing we made those changes to the seating. Let's do this! One! Two! So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father ''after'' you smash Butters onto the table. What dude?  This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers.  Oh my God... Oh my God...  Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  I'll fight anytime, anywhere! Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown. What are you talking about? What? Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them. So what do we do? How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well? That guy's a pretty good wrestler.  You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other. Wait a minute. Who is that? You aren't welcome here, ''Triceratops''! There's someone here to wrestle ''you'', Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now! What? Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
