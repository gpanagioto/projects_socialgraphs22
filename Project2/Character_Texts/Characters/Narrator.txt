 where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents. Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job.  and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams.  That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind. Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew. Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps ''because'' she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day.  But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could ''never'' love ''him'', for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice. And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella. Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world. And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations! And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B.  Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night.

 A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?  And what about the food?  Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form?  It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings. And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?  Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say "yes." Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets.  With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army. The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables. And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving. But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been...  haunted! The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave?
