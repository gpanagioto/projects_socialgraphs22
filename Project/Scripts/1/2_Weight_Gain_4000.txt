Mr. Garrison's classroom.

Kyle

Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?

Stan

Yeah, it was huge.

Cartman

Ugh, I hate those things.

Kyle

Nobody hates rainbows.

Stan

Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?

Cartman

Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: "HEY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!" [Silence.]

Stan

Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?

Cartman

I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!

Kyle

Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.

Cartman

Ohh, rainbows. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool.

Stan

What were you talking about?

Cartman

Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it.

Kyle

No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?

Cartman

Nothing..!

Mr. Garrison

Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? [Silence.] One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.

Wendy

[Softly.] Wow, I knew I would win.

Mr. Hat

Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.

Mr. Garrison

That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.

Wendy

What?

Cartman

What?

Mr. Garrison

Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.

Cartman

Kick ass!

Stan

That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart.

Cartman

Yeah I do, Pop-Tarts are frosted.

Mr. Garrison

Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.

Kyle

Wow, what did you write about Cartman?

Cartman

Oh, you know, this and that.

Wendy

He doesn't even know what he wrote about!

Kyle

What was your paper about Wendy?

Wendy

My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.

Cartman

There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.

Stan

Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.

Cartman

Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?

Wendy

What?

Mr. Garrison

Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford?

Kyle

Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?!

Mr. Garrison

And the presentation will be on national television.

Stan, Kyle

Television!

Mr. Garrison

[Thinking to himself.] Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.

-----


City Hall. Mayor's Office.

Mayor McDaniels

Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.

Ted

Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.

Mayor McDaniels

Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.

Johnson

Maybe even a State Senator.

Ted

Mayor, we should decorate the town square.

Johnson

Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town.

Mayor McDaniels

That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?

Ted

Black as the night itself, Mayor.

Mayor McDaniels

Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.

Ted

If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.

Johnson

Ohhh.

Ted

Ouch. [Johnson Laughs.] Thank you.

-----


South Park Elementary Cafeteria.

Cartman

You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.

Wendy

[Passing by.] Hitler was famous too.

Chef

[Stopping by.] Hello there children.

Kyle, Stan

Hey, Chef.

Chef

How are my little crackers today?

Kyle, Stan

Good.

Chef

Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.

Stan

Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.

Cartman

Hey!

Chef

Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.

Kyle

Wow, are you gonna do it?

Chef

Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.

Stan

Yeah, that'd be cool.

Kenny

(How big's your penis, Chef?)

Chef

Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway.

-----


He giggles, somewhat embarrassed.

-----


Mr. Garrison's Classroom. Garrison is at his desk and Mr. Hat is across from him in a chair.

Mr. Garrison

Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.

-----


Notices Mr. Hat.

Mr. Garrison

Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?

Mr. Hat

[Now on Mr. Garrison's hand.] Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?

Mr. Garrison

Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child.

Mr. Hat

We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.

-----


Flashback to the National Talents Show Finals.

Lil Mr. Garrison

Knock knock, Mr. Hat.

Mr. Hat

Who's there?

Lil Mr. Garrison

Orange.

Mr. Hat

Orange who?

Lil Mr. Garrison

Orange you glad I didn't say banana?

-----


One person claps.

Mr. Hat

Thank you.

-----


Judges show scores of 8.9, 9, 7.8 and 9.2.

Lil Mr. Garrison

Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win.

Show Announcer

And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.

Lil Kathie Lee


If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract
[Mexican puppet] All I can say is, "Wow-wee, look-a where I am."
[Tourist puppet] Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!



-----


Crowd goes wild. Judges show all 10's. Little Garrison is shocked.

-----


In the present.

Mr. Garrison

It wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that?

Mr. Hat

But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.

Mr. Garrison

How?

-----


Mr. Hat whispers to Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!

-----


Mr. Garrison's Classroom, later in the day. The Mayor is now there.

Mayor McDaniels

Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.

Cartman

That kid is me.

Mayor McDaniels

Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.

Mr. Garrison

That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.

Mr. Hat

[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.

Mr. Garrison

[Whispers.] Mr. Hat!

Mayor McDaniels

Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.

Mr. Garrison

Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.

Wendy

Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.

Mayor McDaniels

Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!

-----


Silence.

Mayor McDaniels

And who's our little prize winner again?

Cartman

Me! Eric Cartman!

Mayor McDaniels

How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?

Cartman

Yes ma'am. [Sings.]
I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television.



-----


Bus Stop The kids have gotten off the bus and are going home.

Cartman

[Still singing.]
...I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television...



Stan

[Turning to face Cartman.] We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.

Cartman

Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.

Stan

Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.

Cartman

Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.

Stan

Dolphins are way smarter than you!

Cartman

If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?

Stan

Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!

Cartman

Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!

Stan

Tell me what you wrote about!

Cartman

I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.

Stan

Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!

Cartman

Screw you, hippie!

-----


Cartman's House. Cartman is sitting on the couch in front of the TV eating Cheesy Poofs.

TV Announcer

We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this.

Beefcake

Hey!! You need to get in shape fast?! Wanna look your best?! Tired of the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!

Cartman

Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.

Beefcake

Then bulk up quick, with Weight Gain 4000!!

Cartman

Yes!

Beefcake

With over 4,000 grams of saturated fat per serving, its patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go directly to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream. Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today, and say with me: 'Beefcake!'

Cartman

Beefcake!

Beefcake

Beefcake!

Cartman

Beefcake!

Beefcake

Beefcake!

Beefcake, Cartman

[In unison] BEEFCAKE!

TV Announcer

May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver...

Cartman

Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?

Liane

Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow.

Cartman

But mom, I need it for tomorrow.

Liane

But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.

Cartman

[Shrieking.] Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee n√©e-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!

Liane

Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then.

-----


Cartman smiles broadly.

-----


Mr. Garrison's bed. He hears Kathie Lee singing in his head: "If they could see me now, that little gang of mine, and eating fancy chow..." He wakes up startled.

Mr. Garrison

No, no!

Mr. Hat

[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.

Mr. Garrison

No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it.

-----


Mr. Hat's head starts spinning slowly, demonically, his pupils glow red.

Mr. Hat

Kill!

Mr. Garrison

That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.

Mr. Hat

She'll make a fool of you again.

Mr. Garrison

Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy.

-----


Bus Stop, next morning.

-----


Cartman is a bit bigger and showing it off by wearing a Beefcake muscle shirt instead of layers of clothes.

Cartman

Hey dudes.

Kyle

What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?

Cartman

Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?

Stan

What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.

Cartman

I'm up to 94, thank you very much.

Kenny

(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)

Kyle

Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's.

-----


The others laugh.

Cartman

Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.

-----


He chugs the can of Weight Gain.

Stan

What's that stuff?

Cartman

Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.

Kyle

Bulk up to what, fat-ass?

Stan

Super fat-ass?

Cartman

Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!

-----


The bus Arrives and the others go in ahead of him.

Cartman

Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.

-----


Town Square. A flag goes up.

Mayor McDaniels

Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!

Cows

[Out in a pasture.] Mooooo?

-----


Outdoor stage. The class has moved there to practice a play.

Mayor McDaniels

Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?

Mr. Garrison

Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.

Mayor McDaniels

Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.

-----


Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kevin Stoley go.

Mr. Garrison

Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage.

-----


Pip, Kenny, Red, and Tolkien go.

Clyde Donovan

Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?

Mr. Garrison

Do you have a feather on your head?

Clyde

Yes.

Mr. Garrison

Then you're an Indian.

Clyde

Oh.

Mr. Garrison

Okay Bebe, this is your line.

Bebe Stevens

[Haltingly.] This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.

-----


The curtains part to reveal Clyde, Tolkien, Pip, Red, and Kenny, all dressed like Indians, sitting in a circle beneath a prop teepee.

Mayor McDaniels

Oh, don't they look adorable?

Bebe

Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers.

-----


Pioneers come on stage and start beating the Indians and tossing them about. Screams are everywhere, and a tee-pee falls in front of Kenny.

Mayor McDaniels

Oh my God!

Mr. Garrison

They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.

Bebe

The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands.

-----


Kevin the Indian lands by her, with blood oozing out of a gash on his head. She steps aside. Pioneer Butters punches Indian Pip repeatedly.

Mayor McDaniels

Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.

Mr. Garrison

Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.

Stan

Take that you stupid Indian!

-----


Stan beats Clyde the Indian with the butt of his gun.

Clyde

Dow!

Mayor McDaniels

Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?

Mr. Garrison

To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!

-----


All stop and gasp.

Mr. Garrison

Oh my God, what have I said?

Townsman

He said, "To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"

-----


Boos all around.

Mayor McDaniels

Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.

-----


Garrison skulks away.

-----


Mr. Garrison's House.

Mr. Hat

[In his deep voice.] It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.

Mr. Garrison

I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it.

-----


Mr. Hat laughs.

-----


Town Square Stage.

Kyle

Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.

-----


Cartman is much bigger now.

Cartman

Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.

Kyle

You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!

Cartman

I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!

Kyle

Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"

Cartman

No they don't, you jealous weakling!

Townsman

God damn, that's a big fat ass!

Cartman

Hey!

Wendy

Hi guys.

Cartman

Oh look, another hippie.

-----


Cartman gives her the peace sign.

Cartman

Peace, Wendy.

Stan

Shut up Cartman!

Cartman

Oooh, 
Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...



-----


Wendy moves by Cartman and then whispers to Stan.

Wendy

I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.

Cartman


...K I S S I N G. First comes the baby and...



-----


Jimbo's Guns. There is a poster welcoming Kathie Lee on the left side of the store entrance.

Jimbo Kern

Can I help you?

Mr. Garrison

Yes... I need a gun.

Jimbo

Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?

Mr. Garrison

Other.

Jimbo

Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!

-----


Hands Mr. Garrison a gun.

Jimbo

That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.

Mr. Garrison

[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] I don't know, it's a little small.

Jimbo

Okay, how about this?

Mr. Garrison

[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.

Jimbo

Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.

Mr. Garrison

[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me. [To Jimbo.] I'll take it!

-----


Mr. Garrison's Classroom, lights out. Wendy enters.

Wendy

Hello?

-----


She sneaks over to file cabinet. Sees her paper first and is disgusted to find Cartman's question in writing: "If dolphins are so smart, why do they live in igloos?" Then she finds Cartman's paper.

Wendy

My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."

-----


Mr. Garrison enters. Wendy hides.

Mr. Garrison

Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!

Wendy

[Hushed.] Oh my God.

-----


Town Square. Mr. Garrison walks down the street with his rifle as if it's normal.

Townsman

Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun.

Mr. Garrison

Thank you.

Townswoman

Nice gun Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

Thanks.

-----


He approaches Officer Barbrady.

Mr. Garrison

Hello Officer Barbrady.

Officer Barbrady

Nice Gun.

Mr. Garrison

Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee.

Officer Barbrady

Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.

-----


They look up at it. Two vultures fly around it.

Mr. Garrison

Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.

Officer Barbrady

No problem.

-----


He turns to a fan walking by with a camera.

Officer Barbrady

Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee!

Mayor McDaniels

[On stage.] Where is she?

-----


Cartman, off stage, looming over his friends now.

Cartman

This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!

Kyle

I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.

Wendy

[Rushing in.] You guys, we have to stop him!

Kyle

Stop who?

Wendy

Mr. Garrison!He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford!

Cartman

Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.

Wendy

He's got a gun!

Cartman

You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.

Wendy

It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!

Stan

Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?

Wendy

[Sweetly.] Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?

-----


Stan falters and looks down, unable to resist her.

Kyle

Uh oh, we're losing him.

-----


Cartman looks down at Stan.

Mayor McDaniels

Here she comes.

-----


The band starts playing. Kathie Lee comes in riding in bullet proof 'bubble' on the back of a truck.

-----


Mr. Garrison, looking on from the book depository window.

Mr. Garrison

Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.

Townswoman

We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh.

Kathie Lee Gifford

I love you, too.

Mr. Garrison

Come on you little bitch. [Takes aim.] You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.

Mayor McDaniels

[On stage.] It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.

-----


Crowd cheers.

Mayor McDaniels

...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford.

Chef

Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of uh, the humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.

Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you dowwwwn.
And lick every inch of your bodaay with my tongue.



Mayor McDaniels

WHAT?!

Chef


Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.



Mayor McDaniels

What? Oh God!

Chef


How 'bout you and meee-



-----


Quickly taking the mic from him.

Mayor McDaniels

Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.

Chef


-get together and make... sweet... 

 love?

Mayor McDaniels

Thank you Chef!

-----


She grabs the mike and drags him off.

Chef McDaniels

Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!

Wendy

[Wendy and Stan run up.] Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!

Officer Barbrady

What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. [Flashes back.]

Mr. Garrison

Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee.

Officer Barbrady

Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet‚ÄîI think the book depository would be a good bet‚Äîbook depository‚Äîdepository‚Äîdepository‚Äîdepository ...

-----


His face gets bigger with every repetition. He snaps to.

Officer Barbrady

Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!

Stan

Wendy, look!

-----


Points to book depository.

-----


Back on stage.

Mayor McDaniels

And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman...

Cartman

Cartman, God damn it.

Mayor McDaniels

...is your favorite celebrity, and mine, [Crowd cheers.] Kathie Lee Gifford!

-----


Kathie Lee is thrust up on stage in her bubble by her security force. Cartman's mom hugs her heart.

Kathie Lee

Thank you. I love you all.

-----


Stan and Wendy reach the Book Depository.

Stan

Mr. Garrison, stop!

Mr. Garrison

Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.

Wendy

I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.

Mr. Garrison

You can't know.

Wendy

You should have won that talent show.

-----


On the stage.

Kathie Lee

It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?

Cartman

Here it is, my big moment of fame.

-----


Book Depository.

Mr. Garrison

...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.

Wendy

I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.

Mr. Garrison

It is... too late for me, young Wendy.

-----


Cartman gets on stage, with help from Kyle and Kenny. Mr. Garrison takes aim.

Wendy

You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.

-----


Lowering his weapon.

Mr. Garrison

You... you're right.

Wendy

Gooood.

Stan

Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?

Mr. Hat

[Snapping into position.] The bitch must die!

-----


The stage. Cartman's weight breaks it.

Kathie Lee

[Muffled shrieking] Aaaooghhhh!

-----


She flies through the air. Mr. Garrison fires at her, thinking she is still on stage. Kenny is hit.

Kenny

(Oh no!)

-----


He flies through the air and is impaled through the head by a flag pole. He slides on down.

Kyle

[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!

-----


Kathie Lee's bubble lands on the truck.

Agent 1

Gun!

Agent 2

Gun!

Kyle

Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play.

-----


The entourage leaves and the crowd groans.

TV Crew Director

I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up.

Cartman

Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?

TV Crew Director

Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.

Cartman

[Whining.] But I won the environmental essay contest.

Wendy

You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.

-----


Into mic.

Wendy

I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.

Townsman 1

Who cares?

Townsman 2

Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

Stan

What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?

Wendy

Well, not if it's Cartman.

-----


Into mic.

Wendy

Hey, where are you all going!

-----


Aside.

Wendy

They don't even know what Walden is.

-----


Into mic.

Wendy

I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.

Stan

Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.

Wendy

Ah, what the hell.

-----


Kids walk out.

Mayor McDaniels

Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!

Ted

Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.

-----


In front of flag pole.

Officer Barbrady

[Arresting Mr. Hat.] Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?

Mr. Hat

Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.

Officer Barbrady

You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt.

-----


Apparently, he didn't see Kenny get impaled. Kenny's corpse slides down to base of flag pole.

-----


South Park Mental Home, Mr. Garrison's Hospital Room.

Stan

We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.

-----


Mr. Hat is in a straitjacket.

Mr. Hat

We can still get her! Let mmm--

Mr. Garrison

I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.

Kyle

Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.

Mr. Garrison

Really, on what?

-----


Geraldo.

Geraldo Rivera

Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.

Cartman

When is this going to be on the air?

Geraldo

Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?

Cartman

Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!

-----


Chef's Bedroom.

Chef

He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.

Kathie Lee

Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?

Chef

Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?

-----
