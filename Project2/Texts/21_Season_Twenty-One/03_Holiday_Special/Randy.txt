 Okay, Stan, you got your phone? I need to call everyone on this list. They all live in the same city. Stan, it's not right that people celebrate a man who wiped out millions of people for his own glory!  Okay, next one, come on. Get calling, Stan! You have to overdo it in today's society Stan. You can't be nuanced and subtle anymore or else critics go "Wow, what was the point of that?"  Hi, Francis Melman? Hey, how are you, you fuckin' racist? Good evening. Well, I just have a problem with the racist people of this city. Yeehaw,  I'm from New York! I drive around a big circle n' celebrates a guy who murdered Native Americans! Shoowee! I don't care if people get indigenous, I'll crap all over their statues! I'm the one who's indigenous that this landmark even exists! Not now, Stan. I'm working on a proposal to change British Columbia to just British. Where did you get that? Look, that was a long time ago, okay? It's just a dumb Halloween costume. Look, I was younger! We were all... younger. It was another time. You have to understand, it was 2013. Everyone was stoked on Columbus back then. If you guys found those pictures online, it's only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won't care about what I do now. They'll just see me as a thoughtless, indigenous son of a bitch.  What's the point, Sharon? Soon they're gonna be coming after me. Hell fucking yes I'm in. Alright, everyone's here. Let's do this.  All right, everybody. Hey, thanks for comin'. If uh-I can have your attention, please? I think we're ready to get started. Yeah, I know, but I just, I was really excited, wanted everyone to witness my test. Okay, great. I'm very interested to see [begins speaking more slowly] what those results have to say. Shelly! We've got an emergency! We're getting rid of all the Columbus stuff in this house! Any Columbus costumes? Columbus pictures? They all gotta go! Sharon! Peter Galtman called! He sounds suspicious! We've gotta get rid of all our Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups! Where are they?! Shot, shot glasses, coffee cups, towels, plates. What about the Columbus figurine salt and pepper shakers?  Sharon, do you know what they'll do to us when they find out how we were so stoked on Columbus?? Oho, really?! Did you forget our wedding?! That's you, right there!  Standing there with a big smile on your face! You didn't say anything about it being insensitive then, did you?!  Oh... nooo, nonononono. Thank you. Lo-lovely flowers. Thank, thank you.  Sharon, have you seen my Columbus staff and orb? Sharon, Galtman called again. Somebody's out there trying to get me in trouble! Everyone was excited about Columbus! For some reason people are just pointing fingers at me! Just because he's suddenly not cool now doesn't mean I'm gonna be the effin' scapegoat!  I've gotta burn this stuff!  Oh Goddamnit! Will you get out of here?!  I didn't kiss you 'cause I liked you! Okay, okay That's it! Get off my property!  Get off my land, you piece of shit!  Don't post that.  Shit!  Sharon, good news! The people from the DNA test called. They're on their way over. You wanna come down? You sure? These results could be really interesting.  Oh Goddammit, what the hell do you want? Crap, it's them!  Get over here! I don't have any feelings for you. Do you understand?!  NO! No buts! There is nothing here! I'm not in love with you! Got it?! Good! Now leave!  Hi, sorry. You guys have my results? Well what? You found something there you didn't expect to find? What is it? Do it again? That's not fair. Agh-uh oh, okay, no problem.  Okay! Okay, all set. Let's do this. Aaaaa- An anal swab? Give me tuh, three minutes.  Oh, aw shit.  Whoa, ha-hay.  Chillin', chillin'. Oh, you did? Oh, great. Sure, why not? Uh, I'm here. Huh let's uh, let's do that.  Really? Like Native American? Like a, like a little bit? Nnnuts!   Awww. Neander-thal? What the hell is that about? Wiped out? All of my people? Cross-breeding? You mean rape. You're telling me that my ancestors were raped, and then eradicated by you? You maniacs!   You find this funny, Galtman! Nobody had the guts to tell me what happened to my people, huh? Get the hell out of here!  Waww God! Yeah, sure! Everyone gang up on the Neanderthal! Isn't it funny!  Mr. Galtman, I haven't been honest. It's time for us all... to be honest. What is a holiday? It's a day off work, yes. A day off school. But holidays are also meant to be a time to reflect. Today, I'm happy to announce that the school calendar committee is reinstating the day off.  But instead of glorifying anyone, Let us make it a holiday about the negative feelings that we all sometimes feel. Say what we're really thinking so we can move on. And so, the second Monday in October will still be a holiday, but instead of Columbus Day, it will be for ripping on each other and tearing each other down. And we will call it Indigenous Peoples Day. For perhaps if we all do it at the same time, we won't be so indigenous the rest of the year. And since this is the second Monday of October, let's all embrace the new meaning of the holiday starting right now. That's the spirit, Dave. Come on, everybody, let's just all be totally indigenous. Come on! Good one Kurt. Your wife's a whore. Come on, everyone! Indigenous People's Day! Let's go for it! Okay, I will in a second, fatso. All right, who else? Come on! Get it out of your system! Happy Indigenous People's Day, everyone. Suck my asshole!}}
