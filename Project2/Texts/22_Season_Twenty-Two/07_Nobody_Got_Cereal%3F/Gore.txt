 Fear not. Do not give up on yourself. You must keep believing. It's me. Al Gore. You cannot lose faith, my child, even though everyone is ripping on you. Even though they don't believe you and they're saying you're just seeking attention because you lost the Presidency. You have to be strong! No! not dead! Just merely using a flashlight on the glass to apply the Pepper's ghost technique. You see my point? Things aren't always as they appear. You have to stay strong, my little crusader. I did, too. Didn't get it.  What's that? See you later, alligator.  Oh yeah, you're real cereal.  All I was doing was trying to be your mentor. You know who my mentor was? Me! Al Gore!  And in conclusion, let me just say that you are the future. You cannot give up hope. I brought you all together because I believe in you. Did you guys like my movie? Exactly. I'm trying to get you to ask "What would Al Gore do?" Yes, to get you all to not give up. To get you to fight!  Hey, what are you doing? No, they're depending on me! I'm depending on you, goofball!
