==Fictional character biography==
===Post-Crisis===
Born (allegedly) to a [[French people|French]] father, Andrê Chaumont, and a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] mother, Anna Nguyen,<ref>''Showcase '95'' #8</ref> Jade Nguyen had an unhappy childhood and was sold into slavery. As a young adult, after killing her master, Jade was informally adopted by Chinese freedom fighter Weng Chan, who taught her all he knew about guerrilla fighting. She acquired knowledge of poisons from Kruen Musenda, a famed African assassin known as the "Spitting Cobra", whom she was married to for the two years prior to his death.

She is a long-standing rival of the superhero team the [[Teen Titans]]. However, when Roy Harper, a.k.a. the archer [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], went undercover for the government in a mission to get her confidence and turn her over, the two fell passionately in love. Knowing he would not be able to turn her in, he walked out; Cheshire would not learn his true identity until later. The result of their romance was a daughter, Lian, whom Roy raised.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Returning to her mercenary ways after leaving Lian behind for Roy, Jade saved [[Deathstroke]]'s life so he could help her in stealing nuclear weapons from [[Russia]] in an attempt to blackmail the world. To prove she is not bluffing, she obliterates the fictional [[Middle East]] nation of Qurac, reasoning that since Qurac is a stronghold of [[Onslaught (DC Comics)|Onslaught]] terrorists, that Western countries would be secretly grateful.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #19 (February 1993) [[DC Comics]]</ref> Cheshire's plans were foiled when her base came under attack and she was forced to flee. She later created her own team, The Ravens.

In ''Showcase'' '95 #8, Jade was revealed to have a brother named Luke Chaumont.

Cheshire volunteered to join Tartarus, a group created by [[Vandal Savage]] with the objective of destroying the Titans. During a confrontation with the Titans and the [[H.I.V.E.|H.I.V.E]], Savage shot Cheshire to distract Arsenal. She recovered, but was taken into custody for crimes including destroying Qurac. Sentenced to life imprisonment, she was broken out by the Ravens. Arsenal, however, forced her back into custody.

Eventually, Cheshire discovers that her biological father was a Senator named Robert Pullman, and she attempted to torture and kill him. To that end, she defeated [[Lady Shiva]], and devised a plan to use her to fake her own death and flee the country with her daughter. Jade ties up Shiva, gags her and locks her in the trunk of her car (which was wired to explode), hoping that the authorities will find the charred body of an Asian woman in the flaming car wreck and believe that Jade was killed while fleeing the Senator's murder. On her unfortune, [[Catwoman]] and [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] show up and untie Shiva, while [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] and [[Black Canary]] stop Jade from murdering the Senator, and then take her into custody. While escaping the scene of the attempted assassination, Jade is punched in the face and thrown out of the helicopter the women were escaping in by Black Canary to avoid being beaten to death by an enraged Shiva.

In 2005, she appeared in the [[miniseries]] ''[[Villains United]]'' as a member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=304}}</ref> Cheshire had been blackmailed into joining by Mockingbird, who claimed that there was a small bomb implanted in the back of Lian's head. During the series, she slept with Thomas Blake, a.k.a. [[Catman (comics)|Catman]], and became pregnant with a replacement child, thereby allowing her to leave the team and no longer needing to worry for Lian's safety. At the end of the miniseries, having betrayed the Six to [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Luthor]]'s Society, she is shot and critically wounded by Deathstroke. As the faux Luthor orders the Society's withdrawal, one of his last commands is to bring Cheshire with them, provided she is still alive.

After the "Villains United" series, she later turned up alive, living in a mansion in the [[Himalaya Mountains]] with her son by Blake. Working with Vandal Savage again, she put out hits on the other members of the Secret Six except for Blake. Taking matters into her own hands, she stabs the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], who is working with the Six. Her blade was poisoned (as usual) and she later bartered the antidote to the poison to Catman in exchange for her safety.

In ''[[Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) #12, Cheshire was shown in prison, receiving a visit from Roy Harper and Lian.

In the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', Cheshire was shown to be a member of the new [[Injustice League]]. She was later seen among the exiled villains in ''[[Salvation Run]]''.

Cheshire returned as a member of a small army of villains attempting to collect massive bounties on the heads of the Secret Six. She manages to poison the meals of her targets, but is defeated by [[Jeannette (comics)|Jeannette]].

In ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'', Star City is destroyed by [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]], killing Lian.<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #7 (March 2010)</ref> Cheshire attacks Roy, outraged at him for not keeping Lian safe, injuring him in the process.<ref>''Justice League: Rise and Fall of Arsenal'' #2 (April 2010)</ref> Both Roy and Cheshire continue to fight however Roy manages to pin Cheshire against the wall. Cheshire loses the will to fight and tearfully recalls the loss of her child. Roy comforts her and the two of them attempt to sleep together, but due to Roy's impotence he is unable to please Cheshire in bed, which causes more turmoil in Roy's life forcing him to angrily leave.<ref>''Justice League: Rise and Fall of Arsenal'' #3 (May 2010)</ref>

In ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' Cheshire's son from her involvement with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] (Thomas Blake) is kidnapped; chronologically this takes place after the death of Lian. Catman goes on a murderous rampage believing the child to already be dead only to find the man who orchestrated the kidnapping has given the boy to a loving childless couple and that the kidnapping itself was an act of revenge against Cheshire for murdering his family. Catman, after realizing the child is better left where he is, informs Cheshire that their son is dead. This sends her in to a sorrowful rage, while Catman tells his son to rest in peace after killing all of the kidnappers involved.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #22 (June 2010)</ref>

Cheshire is now a member of Deathstroke's new team of [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans – Villains for Hire|Titans]]. Their first assignment was murdering [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]].<ref>''Titans: Villains For Hire Special'' (May 2010)</ref> It is unforeseen how long she will stay on the team, but it seems one of Deathstroke's goals is to taunt her into overcoming her lost edge after Lian's death.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #25 (July 2010)</ref> She later contacts Roy, forcing him into joining Deathstroke's team so the two of them can kill Deathstroke. Cheshire rationalizes that Roy "owes" her for Lian's death, but while it appears Roy double-crosses her, it is part of Cheshire's plan.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #26 (August 2010)</ref> Afterward, Deathstroke and his team arrive at South Pacific Island to kill cult leader, Drago, over the arena production of blind warriors; however, his team, Cheshire, and Roy betray him, revealing that they had been working with Drago.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #33 (March 2011)</ref> Cheshire and Roy's plan backfired, because Drago never intended to give Cheshire her freedom back. Their attempt to defeat Drago and escape failed miserably. Later, Drago explained to Cheshire that he needs an heir, and she was going to provide him with one.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #34 (April 2011)</ref> Drago tries to convince Cheshire to succumb to him, but Drago was reading her mind and using her thoughts against her.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #35 (May 2011)</ref> Cheshire is rescued by Deathstroke and the Titans. When Drago is defeated, Deathstroke allows him to live and the Titans then leave his island. Cheshire and Roy choose to re-join the Titans.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #36 (June 2011)</ref> Upon returning to the labyrinth, Deathstroke reveals to them that his preceding deeds were used to create a healing machine called a "Methuselah Device" for his dying son, [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]].<ref>''Titans Annual 2011'' (July 2011)</ref> After healing Jericho, Deathstroke claims the machine can also resurrect the dead, offering Cheshire and Roy the chance to revive Lian. Cheshire accepts, but Roy refuses, saying that he has been punishing himself for his daughter's death and that Lian is in a better place. Cheshire joins [[Tattooed Man#Mark Richards|Tattooed Man]] and Cinder in fighting the other Titans to destroy the Methuselah Device.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #37 (July 2011)</ref> After Cinder sacrifices herself to destroy the Methuselah, Cheshire leaves and tells Roy that she will never forgive him.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #38 (August 2011)</ref>

====Fatherhood question====
It was in the ''Birds of Prey'' story arc ''Sensei and Student'' that Cheshire herself states that she had found out the real identity of her father, U.S. Senator Robert Pullman. According to her, Senator Pullman beat her mother and left her alone with a child.

Cheshire was hired by the Brotherhood of Evil to steal a sample of drug material called Bliss. In the same time, Roy Harper is on the trail for the drug as well. Cheshire plays him into helping her, poisoning him during a sexual encounter leading him to believe he had relapsed on drugs. Soon after, still under the employ of the Brotherhood, she, along with a few thugs, defends Monsieur Mallah and The Brain by fighting off Arsenal. Devastatingly mismatched, Arsenal is nearly beaten to death by the thugs while Cheshire steps back and watches. She spares him the misfortune of being beaten to death and provides him with euthanasia. As she is about to do so, Donna Troy arrives to stop her. Nearly losing to her, Cheshire attempts to taunt Donna into killing her as she was told of recent events that were highly sensitive to Donna.
