'''Harley Quinn''' is a [[character (arts)|character]] appearing in <!--This article's main topic is the main comic iteration. Do not change-->[[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Quinn was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]] as a [[comic relief]] [[henchwoman]] for the [[supervillain]] [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and debuted in its 22nd episode, "[[Joker's Favor]]", on September 11, 1992. While intended to appear in one episode, Quinn became a [[recurring character]] within the [[DC Animated Universe]] as the Joker's [[sidekick]] and love interest, and was adapted into [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman (comic book)|Batman comic book]] [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] seven years later, beginning with the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Batman: Harley Quinn'' #1 (October 1999). Quinn's [[origin story]] features her as a former [[psychiatrist]] at [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]] named '''Dr. Harleen Quinzel''' who fell in love with the Joker, her patient, eventually becoming his accomplice and lover. The character's alias is a [[word play|play]] on the [[stock character]] [[Harlequin]] from the 16th-century [[theater]] {{Lang|it|[[commedia dell'arte]]}}.

Following her introduction to the [[DC Universe]] in 1999, Harley Quinn was depicted as a frequent accomplice and lover of the Joker as well as the best friend of fellow supervillain [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]. Later stories depicted Quinn as a supervillain who has left her [[domestic violence|abusive]] relationship with the Joker behind, beginning with the publication of her first [[ongoing series]] written by [[Karl Kesel]] in 2000. After years of scarce appearances in comics, Quinn returned in a leading role in 2009 with the ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' series, as part of an unstable alliance with Poison Ivy and [[Catwoman]]. In 2011, DC's line-wide [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] ''[[The New 52]]'' reintroduced Quinn in the relaunched ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' title, which changed the character's personality, design, and origin, replacing her original jester costume with a revealing ensemble and depicting her to be darker than her earlier counterpart. The character took a lighthearted and humorous direction with her second ongoing series in 2013, written by [[Amanda Conner]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], which features the character moving to her hometown of [[Brooklyn]] and starting her own life in [[Coney Island]]. The character has since been depicted as an [[antihero]] independent of the Joker and a recurring core member of the Suicide Squad, with Poison Ivy becoming her primary romantic interest.<ref name="intoherown">{{cite web | last=Knight | first=Rosie | title=Brilliant Women of Batman: Harley Quinn Comes Into her Own | website=[[DC Comics]]| date=2019-05-22 | url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2019/05/22/brilliant-women-of-batman-harley-quinn-comes-into-her-own | access-date=2021-03-04}}</ref> In 2021, DC's line-wide ''[[Infinite Frontier]]'' relaunch brought Quinn back to [[Gotham City]] and reestablished her as a [[superhero]] seeking redemption for her past actions, with a new design combining her early and modern appearances.

Harley Quinn's abilities include [[expert]] [[gymnastic]] skills, proficiency in [[weapons]] and [[hand-to-hand combat]], complete unpredictability, immunity to toxins, and enhanced strength, agility, and durability. Quinn often wields [[clown|clown-themed]] gag weapons, with an oversized [[mallet]] being her signature weapon. The character has a pair of pet [[hyenas]], [[Bud and Lou]], which sometimes serve as her [[attack dog]]s. As a trained psychiatrist with a genius-level intellect, she is adept at [[deception]] and [[psychological manipulation]].

Harley Quinn has become one of DC Comics' most popular and profitable characters, and has been featured in many of DC's comic books and adapted in various other media and merchandise. DC Comics Publisher [[Jim Lee]] considers Harley Quinn the fourth pillar of DC Comics' publishing line, behind [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]].

Originally voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]] in the [[DC Animated Universe]], she has since appeared in many other DC projects voiced by actresses such as [[Tara Strong]], [[Hynden Walch]], [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]], [[Jenny Slate]], [[Melissa Rauch]], [[Laura Post]], and [[Kaley Cuoco]]; the latter provided the character's voice in the 2019 animated series ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]''. [[Mia Sara]] portrayed the character in the 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''. [[Harley Quinn (DC Extended Universe)|Harley Quinn]] makes her live-action cinematic debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), where she is portrayed by [[Margot Robbie]]. Robbie reprises her role in ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020) and ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' (2021), with elements of her portrayal's design consequentially incorporated into comics, while [[Lady Gaga]] will portray the character in ''[[Joker: Folie à Deux]]'' (2024).

Dini had several names in mind while naming the character, such as [[Columbina|Columbine]], and eventually settled on the name "Harley Quinn".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.angelfire.com/tv/harleyquinn/interview.html|title=Interview with Paul Dini|website=www.angelfire.com}}</ref> Dini chose the name for the character to be in line with other Batman characters's names being [[puns]], and also because he thought "Harley was a fun name for a girl."<ref name="digitalspysecrethistory">{{cite web|last=McCabe|first=Joseph|title=Harley Quinn – her secret history, according to her creators Paul Dini and Bruce Timm|website=Digital Spy|date=November 30, 2018|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a837762/harley-quinn-bruce-timm-paul-dini-interview/|access-date=March 15, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Strangebuttrue"/> The name Harley Quinn is a [[word play|play]] on [[Harlequin]], a  [[stock character]] from the [[sixteenth-century]] Italian physical comedy [[theater]] {{Lang|it|[[commedia dell'arte]]}}.<ref name="The Hollywood Reporter 2016" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Kaya|first=Jennet|title=The Evolution Of The Harlequin Archetype To DC's 'Harley Quinn'|website=[[The Odyssey Online]]|date=March 18, 2019|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/harley-quinn-vs-harlequin|access-date=March 15, 2021}}</ref>

In designing the character, Timm did a "simplified supervillain version" of traditional Harlequin gear; from the {{Lang|it|commedia dell'arte}} original, he took the [[jester hat]], [[ruffled]] collar, diamond pattern, and domino mask and put them on a red-and-black [[bodysuit]], on which the diamonds were strategically placed for easier animation.<ref name="The Hollywood Reporter 2016" /><ref name="funlovingpsycho" /> Timm took Harley Quinn's red and black [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comic book character [[Daredevil (Lev Gleason Publications)|Daredevil]].<ref name="The Hollywood Reporter 2016" /> Dini had previously made a rough design for the character, which Timm improved on.<ref name="Riesman 2020" />

===Expanded role===

Dini also gave Harley new abilities, such as immunity to toxins and enhanced strength and agility, which she received after having been injected a special formula by Poison Ivy. These changes were made to match the needs of the DC Universe; on her new abilities, Dini said: "I figured if she'd be going head-to-head with Batman and the other DC heroes, Harley would need some kind of physical edge."<ref name="backissue" /><ref name="batmanhqreview" />

In the seventh issue of ''Suicide Squad'', Glass revised Harley Quinn's origin story, making it reflect the Joker's origins. In the story, the Joker takes Harleen Quinzel to the [[chemical plant]] where he originated and pushes her into a vat of chemicals against her will, which bleaches her skin and drives her insane, resulting in her transformation to Harley Quinn, similar to the Joker's transformation in his origins.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{harvp|Owens|2017|p=9}}</ref> This origin was received negatively by fans of the character, who felt that its removal of Harley Quinn's choice to become the Joker's accomplice herself, as depicted in her previous origin stories, took out an essential part of her character.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

====Controversies====
The cover of the first issue of the New 52's ''Suicide Squad'' title drew controversy for its [[oversexualized]] depiction of Harley Quinn.<ref name="Riesman 2020"/> This also caused some fans of the character to send Glass [[hatemail]] and personal threats.<ref name="glasscbrtv"/>

In September 2013, DC Comics announced an art contest entitled "Break into comics with Harley Quinn!", in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different [[suicide]] scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley Quinn in the fourth scenario, in which the character attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub. The [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], and [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] all responded to the controversy in an emailed group statement to [[Huffington Post]], stating, "We are disappointed that DC Comics has decided to host a contest looking for artists to develop ways to depict suicide attempts by one of its main villains – Harley Quinn". After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC Comics apologized, saying they should have made it clear it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with Harley Quinn sitting on a rocket while flying in space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|date=September 5, 2013|access-date=January 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan|last=Sieczkowski|title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide|date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|first=Callie|last=Beusman|work=Jezebel|date=September 6, 2013 |access-date=January 10, 2015}}</ref>

Despite being mentally unstable and sometimes distracted, Harley is highly [[intelligent]]. Her intellect extends to her psychological, tactical and [[deception]] abilities, but she does not stand out for particular strategic or scientific skills and often remains subordinate to the Joker, who between the two is the genius and the inventor. Harleen Quinzel earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and as a former Arkham psychiatrist, was highly qualified in [[psychoanalysis]], criminology, and [[forensic psychiatry]]. While not on par with Joker, she is still an expert tactician, deceiver and escapologist, and still shows traces of her psychological experience. Harley Quinn is the only person besides the Joker to concoct Joker Venom, the Joker's signature weapon, and is shown to have reverse-engineered its formula and developed an antitoxin.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Dixon, Chuck & Beaty, Scott|artist =Ruhn, Andy|colorist=McCraw, Tom|letterer=Schubert, Willie|editor=Idelson, Matt & Castro, Nachie|story=Part Four: Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere|title=Joker: Last Laugh|volume=1|issue =4|date=December 2001|publisher=DC Comics|page=22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Kesel, Karl|penciller=Woods, Pete|inker=Lipka, Mark|colorist=Pantazis, Peter|letterer=Lopez, Ken|editor=Idelson, Matt & Castro, Nachie|story=Night and Day|title=Harley Quinn|volume=1|issue=13|date=December 2001|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> She also has an indomitable pathological will. 

Just like Poison Ivy, sometimes and not as much, Harley uses her feminine charm to attract men but only to be able to manipulate them. Unlike the Joker, she is able to simulate sanity, thus being able to pretend to be a "normal" person. In this way, she disguised herself as a security guard, a lawyer and even Poison Ivy and Batgirl.

==Romantic interests==
Harley Quinn has had several love interests, the most notable being Joker and Poison Ivy. Other love interests include Mason Macabre, a character created by Conner and Palmiotti.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Shelley E.|editor1-last=Barba|editor2-first=Joy M.|editor2-last=Perrin|title=The Ascendance of Harley Quinn: Essays on DC's Enigmatic Villain|publisher=[[McFarland (publisher)|McFarland]] |location=Jefferson, North Carolina|year=2017 |isbn=978-1476665238|page=127|quote=}}</ref> [[Plastic Man]] was initially intended to be a love interest for Harley Quinn by Kesel, but was not approved by DC.<ref>{{cite web | title=INTERVIEW: Karl Kesel and David Hahn on their latest Kickstarter, IMPOSSIBLE JONES | website=The Beat | date=June 24, 2019 | url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/interview-karl-kesel-david-hahn-impossible-jones/ | access-date=October 2, 2021 |first=Joe| last=Grunenwald}}</ref>
===The Joker===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote="So Harley in her earlier incarnation really felt like she was the one for the Joker, that she could catch him and cure him and bring him back to humanity. But actually, in the process, she lost hers. Before she knew it she had fallen head-over-heels in love with him. I think initially he was looking to play her and get what he could out of her, and then realized he had opened Pandora’s box and this woman in her madness could match him at just about anything he does. I think he finds that, in some ways, very sexy and attractive. But he’s not really set up to love in the way a regular person is. I think there are sparks and intensity and weird passion of a sort to their relationship, but I would not call it a loving relationship in the traditional sense."|source=Paul Dini, 2017<ref name="EW.com 2017"/>}}

The Joker is Harley Quinn's former lover. Harley's solo comics often explores her former association with the Joker through "[[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of their past exploits, present-day conflicts", or through Harley as she "laments his absence".{{sfn|Weiner|Peaslee|2015|pp=82}} Harley often refers to him as ''"Mistah J"'' and ''"Puddin'"''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/harley-quinn-joker-puddin-nickname-reason/ |title=Why Harley Quinn Calls Joker Puddin' |last=Tyler |first=Adrienne |date=November 30, 2019 |website=Screen Rant |access-date=November 29, 2021}}</ref>

==Character biography==
===DC Animated Universe===
{{main|DC Animated Universe}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Harley Quinn (model sheet).jpg|thumb|upright|Harley Quinn as she appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'']] -->
Harley Quinn first appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (1992–1995), voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]], who subsequently reprised her role in other [[DC Animated Universe]] series, including ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' (1996–2000), ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' (1997–1999), ''[[Static Shock]]'' (2000–2004), and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (2001–2004), as well as the film ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' (2000). Following Sorkin's [[retirement]] in 2012, the character was voiced by [[Melissa Rauch]] in ''[[Batman and Harley Quinn]]'' (2017) and an uncredited [[Tara Strong]] in ''[[Justice League vs. the Fatal Five]]'' (2019).

Originally a career-oriented [[psychologist]], Dr. Harleen Quinzel's life took a radical turn when she chose to take an internship at [[Arkham Asylum]] for a semester of college. Convinced by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] himself to do it, Harleen interviewed him and learned he was [[Child abuse|abuse]]d as a child by his [[alcoholic]] father (later learning this backstory to have been one of several different stories he had told to others, some with different details each time), and after more interviews, determined [[Batman]] was the primary source of the Joker's anger and was to blame for his actions, but that she also had fallen in love with him. Harleen helped the Joker escape and, renaming herself Harley Quinn, became his sidekick in hopes that she could win his love, going on a crime spree across the [[United States of America]].<ref name="Mad Love">"[[The Batman Adventures: Mad Love#In other media|Mad Love]]" (''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''; 1999)</ref>

After assisting Joker in attempting to assassinate [[Jim Gordon (character)|Commissioner James Gordon]] by planting a bomb at a dinner in his honour, she was subdued by Batman, and subsequently an accomplice in virtually all of Joker's criminal schemes.<ref>"[[Joker's Favor]]" (''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''; 1992)</ref> On occasion, she would be kicked out of Joker's gang when unintentionally upstaging or annoying the Joker, on one of these occasions teaming up with [[Poison Ivy]], with the two becoming close friends and a successful crime duo independently.<ref>"[[Harley and Ivy]]" (''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''; 1993)</ref> While imprisoned on her own in [[Arkham Asylum]], Batman offered her a pardon in exchange for helping him track down the Joker after he had stolen a [[nuclear bomb]].<ref>"[[Harlequinade (Batman: The Animated Series)|Harlequinade]]" (''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''; 1994)</ref> The day she is declared rehabilitated and paroled, Harley's hyperactivity and unfamiliarity with the "real" world leads to her accidentally kidnap someone and be returned to Arkham yet again.<ref>"[[Harley's Holiday]]" (''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''; 1994)</ref>

In the 31-episode ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' webtoon, Harley joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Catwoman]] in a co-starring role.

After several failed attempts at rehabilitation, Harley returns to the Joker's side. However, after another failed attempt to kill Commissioner Gordon leads the Joker to forgetting their anniversary, Harley re-examines her life and decides that as Batman was the cause of the Joker's obsession, she should capture and kill him herself for him to kill, doing so by falsely pretending to have found sanity and luring Batman into a trap. Recognizing Harley to have come closer to killing him than Joker has ever done, Batman tricks her into facilitating his escape by making her call the Joker and tell him what she has done, knowing that he would not allow anyone other than himself to kill Batman, pushing her aside and unknowingly knocking her out a window. Recovering in Arkham, Harley decides that the Joker will never truly love her, before returning to her devotion upon seeing that he has left her a rose in a vase from him by her bedside table, with a note hoping that she gets better soon.<ref name="Mad Love" /> Harley later references having convinced the Joker to attend [[couple's counseling]] with her.<ref>"[[List of Justice League episodes#48|Wild Cards, Part II]]" ([[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']], 2003)</ref>

In the film ''[[Batman and Harley Quinn]]'', Harley (voiced by [[Melissa Rauch]]) is working as a waitress after breaking up with the Joker again. Approached by Batman and [[Nightwing]] to help stop Ivy from accidentally causing the extinction of all life on Earth, Harley agrees to help them after having [[sex]] with Nightwing, convincing them to light [[Floronic Man|Jason Woodroe]] on fire after she talks Ivy down with tears. Sometime later, Harley hosts a reality television game show, where she makes contestants run an elaborate obstacle course to win a year of therapy from a professional, in a scathing indictment of the American insurance system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/sdcc-justice-league-dark-animated-film-confirmed-teen-titans-more-announced|title=SDCC: "Justice League Dark" Animated Film Confirmed; "Teen Titans" & More Announced|publisher=Comic Book Resources|last=Damore|first=Meagan|date=July 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/batman-and-harley-quinn-movie-cast-plot/|title=Batman and Harley Quinn Cast, Characters Revealed|last=Trubore|first=Dave|publisher=Collider|date=April 3, 2017|access-date=April 7, 2017}}</ref>

In the film ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' (again voiced by Sorkin), flashbacks reveal Harley's apparent final actions after returning to the Joker again were assisting him in kidnapping [[Tim Drake]] and torturing him into insanity in order to transform him into their son "J.J", so that they can start a family together. She later fought [[Batgirl]] who angrily chastised her for even helping Joker commit a heinous act but fell deep into an abyss, leading to the latter presuming her dead, though she survived as depicted in the present, where she appears at the end of the movie, revealed to be the grandmother of the Jokerz members, the [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Dee Dee Twins|Dee Dee Twins]], who address her as "Nana Harley", having reformed from her life of crime.

===DC Comics Universe===
{{main|DC Universe}}
Harleen Quinzel was a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum, and after meeting the Joker, she became his frequent accomplice, takes on the name Harley Quinn, and gets in an abusive codependent relationship with him. She eventually splits up with him, and becomes a solo criminal, forming a criminal gang called the Quinntets. Following the Quinntet's dissolution, Harley Quinn moves to Metropolis with her best friend Poison Ivy, where she works as a love columnist in the [[Daily Planet]] under the alias Holly Chance. She then moves back to Gotham City, where she then voluntarily incarcerates herself in Arkham.<ref>Harley Quinn vol. 1</ref> Harley Quinn then spents a year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female Ventriloquist, who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and Commissioner Jim Gordon foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole. <ref>''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007) by Paul Dini</ref> She then briefly joins the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], then decides to quit.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #105 (June 2007)</ref>

====''Final Crisis''====
During ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'', a reformed Harley Quinn resides in an Amazon-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian stola or chiton. She befriends the former Catwoman replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by "Athena" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter Mary Marvel. The group reveals Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to Apokolips. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by Thalia as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to Gotham City.

====''Gotham City Sirens''====
{{main|Gotham City Sirens}}
Harley Quinn then joins forces with Poison Ivy (Pamela Isley) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. In ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the "villain and hero stuff." The dysfunctional, "horrible" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together. Following several adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20–23. DC Comics</ref> Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011). DC Comics</ref> Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011). DC Comics</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says she saw good in them and only wanted to help. As Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011). DC Comics</ref>

====''New 52'' and ''Rebirth''====
Like her previous incarnations, Harleen Quinzel was still the Joker's psychiatrist, but before she becomes Harley, the Joker pushes her into a vat of chemicals, bleaching her skin white and driving her insane. Harley Quinn is forced to join the Suicide Squad by Amanda Waller. Harley Quinn then leaves Gotham City and moves back to her hometown [[Brooklyn]] and resides in [[Coney Island]].

====''Infinite Frontier''====
Harley Quinn moves back to Gotham City in an attempt to reestablish herself as a hero, aiding the Batman Family and trying to make up for her past "where she often [[Enabling|enabled]] the Joker".<ref name="phillipsdcinterview"/>

==Other versions==
* Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries ''[[Batman: Thrillkiller|Thrillkiller]]''. This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''. DC Comics</ref>
* In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, "[[alternative lifestyle]] [[folk music|folkies]] Ivy and Harley".<ref>''Elseworlds 80-Page Giant''. DC Comics</ref>
* On the new [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's business manager and is killed by the [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]].<ref>''Countdown'' #32. DC Comics</ref>

* In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a stripper (though this may be a ruse) and is never shown speaking.<ref>''Joker'' (2008). DC Comics</ref> In ''[[Batman: Damned]]'', the sequel to ''Joker'', Harley snaps after the Joker's mysterious death following a battle with Batman and performs surgery on herself and dressing herself to make her resemble the Joker. Harley leads the Joker's remaining henchman on a revenge mission, blowing up several buildings and taking over the GCPD building and defacing the Batsignal so that it resembles the Joker's smile. Batman arrives and defeats the henchman before Harley paralyzes him with a toxin, beats him with her baseball bat, and attempts to sexually abuse him. Batman is then possessed by the Enchantress and strangles Harley against the Batsignal.<ref>''Batman: Damned'' #2</ref>
* In the [[Ame-Comi Girls]] universe, Harley is partnered with the [[Catwoman]] and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] as part of a trio of villains.
* The [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] version of Harley Quinn is named '''Yo-Yo'''. She was a henchwoman of the [[Alternate versions of the Joker#Flashpoint|Joker]], and the [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Batman]] chased her down to find the Joker's location, as she had kidnapped [[Two-Face|Judge Dent]]'s children. He chased her to the ledge of the building around Crime Alley. Batman drops her off the roof, but she is luckily saved by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1</ref>
* In ''[[Batman '66]]'', a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 1960s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted glasses, a long red dress and red blouse, large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as '''Dr. Holly Quinn''', Ph.D., a psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]], referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces the Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.<ref name=":0">''Batman '66'' #3. DC Comics</ref> Dr. Quinn is manipulated by the Catwoman and the Joker to perfect the Joker Wave — a hysteria-inducing transmitting dish used on Gotham. Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects — freeing the people of Gotham but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin, wearing a [[roller derby]]-inspired version of the classic Harley costume. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of [[Matches Malone]]) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.<ref>''Batman '66'' #24. DC Comics</ref>
* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.

Harley struggles to come to terms with the Joker's death but develops an attachment to the Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath but is also grief-stricken when he is killed by Superman. She later confronts the Black Canary but hesitates upon realizing she is pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to the Black Canary she has a four-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and the Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Brainiac alongside the Black Canary, the Green Arrow, and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed her daughter thinks her mother is her Aunt Harley, though Harley hopes to one day tell her the truth.
* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is mutated into a humanoid hyena by the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. She is knocked out by Batman during the battle at Arkham Asylum, and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally, causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.<ref>''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #6. DC Comics/IDW</ref>
* In ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', it is revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), and she was replaced by another girl, '''Marian Drews''', without the Joker even realizing it. Once the Joker was cured of his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting "normal". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the "fake Harley" unconscious, and reveals to Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) there were two Harleys all along. While Harleen loved the Joker "despite his flaws", Marian loved the Joker by "his flaws". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself "until the real Joker returns", dubbed the '''Neo Joker''', and later romancing Poison Ivy.<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref>
*In ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', Harley fell in with the Joker (in this version, a gangster) after leaving Charm School, but left him when he began his journey into the occult. By the time of the events of the story, Harley is drawn to England by a voice she believes is the Joker, but turns out to be the Joker's Daughter. She rejects the Joker's Daughter's attempt to have the Joker resurrected in the body of Poison Ivy, instead of beginning a relationship with Ivy herself.
* In the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Gwenpool Strikes Back]]'', a variant of [[Gwenpool|Gwen Poole]] based on Harley Quinn (from ''[[Civil War II]]'') is introduced as a member of the [[Gwenpool Strikes Back|GwenHive]], dubbed "[[Gwenpool Strikes Back|Harley Gwen]]".<ref>''[[Gwenpool Strikes Back]]'' #4, [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Arkham Knight Harley Quinn Promo.jpg|thumb|right|Harley Quinn in a promotional image for ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'']] -->
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', she takes control of the eponymous asylum to facilitate the Joker's escape, and makes subsequent appearances throughout the game; kidnapping Warden [[Quincy Sharp]] and [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon]], releasing [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] from her cell, and attempting to kill Batman on the Joker's orders. After Batman defeats Harley, he locks her up in a vacant cell, where she remains for the rest of the storyline. In this game, Harley wears an original nurse-themed costume.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', she continues to work with the Joker within the eponymous city-prison, making several appearances throughout the main story. Following the Joker's death due to his Titan-inflicted disease, Harley watches in shock as Batman carries his lifeless body outside Arkham City. In this game, Harley wears a biker-girl themed costume, using a low-key version of her usual makeup, with heavy eye shadow in lieu of her domino mask. 
**Harley also appears in the ''Harley Quinn's Revenge'' [[expansion pack]], set after the events of the main story, wherein she seeks revenge on Batman for the Joker's death. After taking several police officers hostage in Arkham City to lure Batman into a trap, she manages to capture him, but is ultimately defeated after [[Tim Drake|Robin]] rescues Batman. By this point, Harley has taken full control of the Joker's gang, and has an adopted a new look: mostly black clothes, with hair dyed black, a mourning veil, and a "J" necklace.
* Harley Quinn appears in the mobile game ''[[Batman: Arkham City Lockdown]]'', set before the events of ''Arkham City'', where she takes a reporter a hostage to ransom her for the Joker's release from prison. After luring Batman into a trap, she tries to execute the bound and gagged reporter but is stopped by one of Batman's batarangs.
* Dr. Harleen Quinzel appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', which takes place before her transformation into Harley Quinn. She interviews the Joker at Blackgate Prison and falls in love with him after he confesses his fascination with someone whom he considers special to him (with Harley believing the Joker is talking about her, when in reality he is thinking of Batman). She later appears amongst the prison's other staff members held hostage by the Joker when he takes over the facility, but she is rescued by Batman. Quinzel is last seen escorting the Joker to his cell after he is defeated by Batman.
* Harley returns in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Still in charge of the remains of the Joker's gang and vengeful against Batman, she is recruited by the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] to assist him in his plot to kill the Dark Knight. Harley discovers Batman and Robin's hideout at the abandoned Panessa Studios, where the two are keeping the victims of the Joker's blood transfusion who were not affected by the cure under observation.

Harley is then locked up by Batman in one of the Joker victims' cells left vacant, where she remains for the rest of the storyline.
