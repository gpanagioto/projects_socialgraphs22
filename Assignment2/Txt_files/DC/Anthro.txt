'''Anthro''' is a [[fictional]] superhero [[Character (arts)|character]] published by [[DC Comics]], presented as the "first boy", a [[Cro-Magnon]] born to [[Neanderthal]] parents. Anthro was created by cartoonist [[Howard Post]]; he first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #74 (March 1968).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | contribution = Anthro | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 17 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>

==Publication history==
After a single ''Showcase'' appearance, Anthro was given his own title, which lasted for 6 issues (1968–69).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=209}}</ref> All six issues were written and drawn by Post, with [[Wallace Wood]] providing inking for the final issue.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=Anthro |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/anthro.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>

Since the cancellation of his title, he has made minor appearances, most notably in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #2. Subsequently, Anthro appeared in the 2006 revival of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' and the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[J. G. Jones]]. Anthro also starred in the first story in ''DC Universe Holiday Special 2010''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Anthro''' is the first [[Cro-Magnon]] boy born in the [[Stone Age]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=18}}</ref> His father, [[Neanderthal]] [[caveman]] Ne-Ahn, is the chief of his tribe; his mother, a captive member of another tribe. Winning two competing cavegirls as his wives, Cro-Magnon women '''Embra''' and '''Nima''', Anthro begins the [[human]] race, as Embra lives to bear his first child.

''Justice League Europe'' Annual #2 features a version of Anthro. In an alternate time-line, an older [[Silver Sorceress]], lost in time, is rescued from a large creature by Anthro. He exhibits great eagerness, smashing the beast long after it is subdued. A bored cavegirl, seemingly either Embra or Nima, joins the Sorceress in watching Anthro's 'battle'.

Anthro is featured in the graphic novel "[[Doctor Thirteen]]: Architecture & Mortality". Speaking only French, he is soon melted out of a chunk of ice into what seems to be the modern day. He assists the Doctor, [[Infectious Lass]], [[Genius Jones]], Captain Fear and other somewhat heroic characters in a mission to keep their existence relevant. The story ends with his status seemingly threatened by the reader of the novel itself.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Issue one of ''[[Final Crisis]]'' features an extended introduction involving Anthro, where the [[New God]] [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] appears before the boy and gives him the knowledge and skill to make fire.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #1. DC Comics</ref> This starts a sequence in which Anthro is able to fight off a group of savage raiders (led by [[Vandal Savage]]) with a burning stick. In this depiction, Anthro is much more caveman like in his attire, wearing only a loincloth and a satchel, and carrying stone and wood weapons while his body looks more like a modern teenager rather than having a Cro-Magnon appearance. In addition, he only expresses himself with ! and [[?]] signs, as he is apparently unable to speak, as are the rest of the cavemen characters in the book. In the issue's pages, Anthro seems to have a vision of Kamandi.<ref>''Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne'' #1-2 (May–June 2010). DC Comics.</ref> In the final issue of ''Final Crisis'', Anthro appears as an old man, drawing the symbols he saw on Metron's body onto a cave wall. As he finishes drawing, he dies peacefully, watched over by [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], who is lost in time.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (2009). DC Comics.</ref> The after-effects of Anthro's death on his friends and family is explored in the limited series ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]''.

During the "[[Dark Nights: Death Metal]]" storyline, Anthro is among the superheroes revived by Batman using a Black Lantern ring.<ref>''Dark Nights: Death Metal'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Anthro is a skilled tracker and hunter.

==Other versions==
Anthro had a supporting role in the ''[[Booster Gold]]'' series, starting with issue eight. In this story, as in ''Tales of the Unexpected'', Anthro wears a leather jacket that resembles [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]]'s, but has Anthro's name on the sleeves instead of "Fair Play". This is an alternate time-line Anthro, who is part of a resistance group against the murderous Maxwell Lord. Fellow members include Green Arrow, Hawkman, Wild Dog and Pantha. During the flight to Lord's headquarters, Anthro is taken out by a mind-controlled Superman.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #7-9 (2008)</ref>

In ''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #1, Superman moves briefly through Earth-20, where alternate versions of a number of DC Comics older heroes exist as 'The Society of Super-Heroes', a group of 'pulp'-style mystery men led by Doc Fate and including Immortal Man.<ref>''Final Crisis Secret Files #1 (2009)</ref> Writer Grant Morrison described it as a '1940s retro thing'. ''<ref>Interview with Grant Morrison - {{cite web|url=http://www.weeklycrisis.com/2009/05/grant-morrisons-multiversity-more.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006132117/http://www.weeklycrisis.com/2009/05/grant-morrisons-multiversity-more.html |archive-date=2014-10-06}}</ref> In ''The Multiversity - The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors from the Counter-World'' #1 (2014), it is revealed that Immortal Man of Earth-20 is Anthro, who was exposed to the same meteorite that bestowed Vandal Savage's powers on him. He and Doc Fate's Society of Super-Heroes are Earth-20's last defence from an invasion by their paired evil world, Earth-40, where the militia is led by Vandal Savage and [[Lady Shiva]].

==In other media==
Anthro appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Siege of Starro Pt. 1". He is shown during a montage showcasing various heroes throughout history where he defeats [[King Kull (DC Comics)|Kru'll]] [[Vandal Savage|the Eternal]] after the villain attacks a group of peaceful cave people.

Anthro is mentioned in [[The CW]]'s live-action [[Arrowverse]] series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''. In the episode "[[The Flash (season 5)#ep108|Failure Is An Orphan]]" of the series' fifth season, [[Eobard Thawne]] tells [[Nora West-Allen|Nora West-Allen / XS]] that he has been tracking the timeline "from Anthro the first boy to [[Kamandi]] the last".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/03/13/the-flash-name-drops-two-significant-dc-heroes--and-teases-crisi/|title='The Flash' Name-Drops Two Significant DC Heroes -- And Teases "Crisis on Infinite Earths?"|website=Comicbook.com|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|date=March 12, 2019|access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref>
