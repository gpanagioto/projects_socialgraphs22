I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers.  I told you people to keep civilians back! We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to- So this is all pee-related? And? Stay BACK! And why is that? My God! He's become full of rage!  Damn it where is that antidote?! All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys!  They're still angry. It's out of control!  Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey!   You sure you want to do this? He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun!  You all need to eat your banana immediately!
