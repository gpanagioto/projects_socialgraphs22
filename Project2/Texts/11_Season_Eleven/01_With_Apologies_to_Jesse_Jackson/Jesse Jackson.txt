 The puzzle you were solving was "people who annoy you". Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.  Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?  Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing.   Kiss it. Apologize. Kiss it. That's right.  Apologize.
