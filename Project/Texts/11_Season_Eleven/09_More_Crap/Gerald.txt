Hey Randy.  Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster!  I doubt it.  Jesus... It's... other-worldly.  Oh yes there is! You could do it again! Think about it: you weren't even ''trying'' to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually ''worked'' at it! That's what we're here for.  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap ''in Zurich''. They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
