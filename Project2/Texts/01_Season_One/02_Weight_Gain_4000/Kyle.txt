Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning? Nobody hates rainbows. Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm. No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass? Wow, what did you write about Cartman? What was your paper about Wendy? Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?! Wow, are you gonna do it? What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground? Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. Bulk up to what, fat-ass? Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load. You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever! Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!" I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman. Stop who? Uh oh, we're losing him.  Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards! Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
