==Fictional character biography==
Vincent Stegron was hired by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to work with [[Lizard (character)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to study [[DNA]] of [[dinosaur]]s from the [[Savage Land]]. Inspired by the experiment that turned Connors into the Lizard, Stegron stole some dinosaur DNA and injected himself with it. In moments, Stegron transformed into an orange semi-humanoid ''[[Stegosaurus]]''-like creature. Stegron gained the ability to command real dinosaurs, and he planned to use them in his plans for conquest of the world and converting all of humanity into creatures like himself. Taking several dinosaurs with him from the Savage Land to New York City, he encountered [[Spider-Man]], [[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]], and [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=72}}</ref> During the battle that followed, Stegron was beaten by being knocked into a nearby river and seemingly drowning.<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #19–20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Months later, Stegron returned and blackmailed Connors into helping him restore several dinosaur remains from a museum. Connors did what Stegron asked and accidentally turned into the Lizard. The two reptile-men clashed as Spider-Man arrived and later Stegron was sent into hibernation by the extremely cold temperatures the weather was producing.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #165–166. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Months later Stegron, now back in his human form, woke from hibernation and wandered New York. During a battle between the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and Spider-Man, Stegron regained his dinosaur form and powers and joined many of Spider-Man's enemies (including [[Doctor Octopus]], Vulture, [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Answer (comics)#Answer (Aaron Nicholson)|Answer]], [[Swarm (Marvel Comics)|Swarm]], [[Ringer (comics)|Strikeback]], and [[Leila Davis|Hardshell]]) in an all-out battle to defeat him. Stegron was knocked unconscious and was taken in by the authorities.<ref>''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Stegron eventually returned to the Savage Land, where he took over a S.H.I.E.L.D. installation which drew the attention of [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]], Black Widow, and Black Panther. During the battle over the installation, Stegron was forced into an extremely cold environment and again went into hibernation.<ref>''[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime later, Stegron managed to awaken from his slumber and terrorized [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] (who was illegally drilling in the Savage Land). Soon, Stegron was opposed by Ka-Zar, [[Shanna the She-Devil]], and Spider-Man. During the battle, the [[Hulk]] and a gigantic chicken/ox-like creature known as [[Chtylok]] arrived and helped Stegron fight Roxxon Oil. The heroes joined forces with Stegron when they realized he was trying to protect the Savage Land. Eventually, Stegron managed to scare the Roxxon agents and was left in peace in the Savage Land.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #13–15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime later, Stegron (reverted to his human form) exiled himself to wander the Arctic Circle when he stumbled upon the Rock of Life. Inspired by its de-evolving abilities, he took it with him back to New York where he slowly began to transform back into his dinosaur form. He then sent the Rock to a friend of his, who then put it on display at the Museum of Natural History in hopes that it would devolve the inhabitants of New York City into prehistoric creatures like himself with him as their leader. As a result, various heroes and villains with connections to the animal kingdom such as Spider-Man, [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], Vulture, Lizard, [[John Jameson (character)|Man-Wolf]], and [[Vermin (character)|Vermin]] were affected by its power, causing an increase in their savagery. Spider-Man maintained control, and he discovered Stegron's plans at the museum where the two battled. With the help of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]], Spider-Man managed to stop the Rock's powers from reaching others in New York using a piece of his armor. He then beat Stegron into submission. Stegron was then taken into custody by the authorities as the [[Fantastic Four]] placed the Rock in a secure vault in the Baxter Building.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #23–27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Stegron again returned to the Savage Land, but shortly after his return, Roxxon Oil attacked again, intent on obtaining [[vibranium]]. Stegron was recruited by Ka-Zar and Brainchild of the [[Savage Land Mutates]] to help fight the attackers.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' vol. 2 #6–7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Stegron was later seen in the [[Negative Zone]]'s Prison during the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four]]'' #3 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Somehow, he escaped and returned to the Savage Land. While there he happened upon the starving [[Devil Dinosaur]], who had slumped into a depression after his companion [[Moon-Boy]] was kidnapped by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. Fearing for the survival of the beast (as it was the last of its species), Stegron left the Savage Land without informing Ka-Zar to wage war on S.H.I.E.L.D. Building an army of reanimated dinosaurs, Stegron marched across the US, attacking military base after base, searching for the missing primate. He met little opposition. His only serious challenge coming from attacks by the [[Fifty State Initiative]]. Eventually, due to the help of their new recruit [[Reptil]], Stegron was defeated and taken into custody. Learning the motive behind his attack, they agreed to return Moon Boy to the Savage Land to be reunited with his companion.<ref>''Avengers the Initiative: Featuring Reptil''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Stegron later collaborates with [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] in a plan to turn humanity into dinosaurs where they fought Spider-Man and the mutant students from the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. The duo's plans are unraveled by their own infighting, purposely exacerbated by their mutual crush Shark Girl who caused their powers to neutralize each other.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #1|date =  February 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = New York City}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = March 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = New York City}}</ref>

Stegron is later revealed as the mastermind behind a monster attack on a church. After [[Eddie Brock]] discovers one of Stegron's dinosaurs and delivers it to [[Liz Allan]], CEO of [[Alchemax]], he heads down the sewers and finds his lair, until he is spotted and captured.<ref>''Venom'' #151. Marvel Comics.</ref> Venom then manages to escape with help from Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, who were investigating the dinosaur attacks. When Venom and Moon Girl return to the hideout, Stegron takes control of Devil Dinosaur and sends him to attack them.<ref>''Venom'' #152. Marvel Comics.</ref> Stegron revealed that he had earlier been hired by Alchemax to find a way to have healing factors placed in humans which led to him doing his dinosaur serum experiments on homeless people and wild animals. Before Stegron can dump the dinosaur serum into the water supply, Venom and Moon Girl worked together to free Devil Dinosaur from Stegron's control and defeat Stegron who was placed in Alchemax's custody.<ref>''Venom'' #153. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though his Dinosaur People creations still resided underground.<ref>''Venom'' #154. Marvel Comics.</ref>
