Officer, you have to let us out of here! We don't have much time! Sir, you have to listen to us. ManBearPig is real.  Where the hell is Al Gore? Why isn't he coming for us? We broke out of jail, Dad. Cartman tricked the guards. We all ran home to be with our parents. Where's mom? Dad, that thing we saw take Ned? It was ManBearPig. It was real! No, Dad. It's...  Why do you keep looking at the TV?  You've been playing Red Dead Redemption?! I thought you were working on getting me out! You're all the way to St. Denis?! That's like 40 hours of gameplay! How could you uh! Are you high right now?! Oh my God! I can't believe you would get high and play video games while your son is in jail! You're such an asshole!  Yeah, because I learned a lot about-!  Whoa whoa, what are you talking about I sound like Grandpa?  Someone made a deal with it... a long time ago.  What did you do? This isn't the first time ManBearPig has shown up, is it?! What happened?! Cut the shit, Grandpa! You people knew! You made a deal with that thing!  Why did you old people make a deal?! And you just signed away the future?! What stuff?! You couldn't control yourselves, so now that thing is here to kill all of us! Good fuckin' job, Grandpa!  You didn't stop to think about what it would mean for us? And you didn't give two shits what it would mean for your grandchildren.  Aaaah. This is supposed to make me feel better? You... people... made a deal with ManBearPig! How?! Where?! Tell me how the deal happened so that I can try to make it go away!  Guys? Guys! Guys, thank God! Just stay right there, Grandpa!  I know all about the deal. I know what we have to do. I figured you guys would be hiding somewhere. This is the first place I thought to look. Guys, listen: my stupid grandpa and a bunch of other old people made the deal with ManBearPig. It's here because of their greediness. Shut up, Grandpa! I know where to go, but I need your help. I'm going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal. We have to try.  Listen! We know what to do now! No! I need to face ManBearPig! Yes I do. We're going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal once and for all. 'Kay. Yes. Yes, we agree to give back cars and ice cream.   Um, he says he'll never come back again, but... we have to give up soy sauce and Red Dead Redemption 2. ...Yeah, that's what I thought.  Um, could we possibly talk about restructuring a new deal? No, no. Just like, um, can we do, like, a renegotiation? Where do I sign that? Okay. Shut up, Grandpa! 'Key, got it. 'Kay, where do I sign that?
