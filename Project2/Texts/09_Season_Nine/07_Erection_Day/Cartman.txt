Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?! No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.  Up yours, Butters. Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man? Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food. Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times. I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener. Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.  Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.  Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."  All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right." All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful." Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice. Aaagh!  D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say "That's the bad guy!" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
