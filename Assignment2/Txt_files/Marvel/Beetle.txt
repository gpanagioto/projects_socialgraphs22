The '''Beetle''' is the name used by multiple fictional [[character (arts)|characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is also the name of three versions of high tech armor used by seven separate characters.

The numerous incarnations of the Beetle have also appeared in Marvel-licensed media, such as television series and video games.

==Publication history==
The Beetle debuted in the "Human Torch" segment of ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) with the original incarnation [[Abner Jenkins]] using the first armor.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=22–23}}</ref> This version was beaten by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]]. The Human Torch had another tussle with the Beetle in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #21 (Jan 1965), aided by Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=28}}</ref>

This version would be used until the character switched to the second armor in ''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #59 (October 1981) (which is most associated with the name) and would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Jenkins's alter ego was changed to MACH-1. A new version debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and the second incarnation [[Leila Davis]]. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis who was still inside at the time. After Davis's death, the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. The individual names of these characters were not revealed in this initial appearance.

==Fictional character biography==
===Abner Jenkins===
[[File:Strange Tales 123.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cover to ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 which showed [[Abner Jenkins]]'s original Beetle armor (in the left). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
{{main|Abner Jenkins}}

An ex-master [[mechanic]], Abner Jenkins left his career to pursue life as an adventurer seeking wealth and fame under the Beetle name. A defeat at the [[Fantastic Four]]'s hands sent Beetle into the direction of a life of crime where he was even a member of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Years later, Jenkins joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a choice that eventually took him on a more heroic pathway in life.

===Leila Davis===
[[Image:Thunderbolts35.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Leila Davis]]'s Beetle armor on the cover of ''Thunderbolts'' #35. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
The widow of minor [[supervillain]] [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], Leila Davis began her criminal career as a driver for the super villain [[Sinister Syndicate]] team. After Ringer's death, Leila would go on to have her own costumed career, first as Hardshell and finally as the Beetle. She was killed when [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] crushed the Beetle armor with her still inside.

Leila is introduced as the widow of the [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] (Anthony Davis). After Anthony is manipulated by [[Abner Jenkins]] into a life of crime that included multiple conflicts with [[Spider-Man]], he was shot by the anti-hero [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]]. Leila vows revenge on all three. She joins the [[Sinister Syndicate]] team led by Jenkins, in order to get close to him. She also serves as the group's [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #56 (2001). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Once Boomerang is captured by Spider-Man on the group's first mission, she began dating [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]]. Eventually, the [[Shocker (character)|Shocker]] engineers a breakout for Boomerang and the team fractures, with Boomerang, [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] and Leila (using her husband's old weapons) battling the Beetle, Speed Demon and [[Hydro-Man]] in the middle of [[New York City]]. After attempting to kill Beetle, Leila is disarmed by Spider-Man and arrested along with Jenkins and Boomerang.<ref>''The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime later, she is paroled from prison and immediately returns to her old ways. Donning a new red and black suit of weaponized armor and referring to herself as "Hardshell", she allies with Boomerang, Rhino and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. The group becomes involved in a massive fight that also involves [[Stegron]], [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Swarm (Marvel Comics)|Swarm]], the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], Jenkins and Spider-Man, with each party trying to gain control of an experimental gun. Spider-Man eventually stood victorious and most of the costumed criminals are taken into custody. Leila is teleported away by her husband Anthony, who had survived being shot by Scourge and had been turned into the cyborg Strikeback by the criminal organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]<ref>''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She reappears years later taking on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] team (which a reformed Jenkins helped found), ironically now referring to herself as the "Beetle". She is wearing a tank-like exoskeleton painted in the same paint scheme as both of Jenkins' previous Beetle costumes—a new iteration of the Beetle armor that Jenkins himself had designed while working for the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As the second Beetle, Leila eventually joins the group known as the Redeemers, which includes former members of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> When her true identity is revealed to the rest of her teammates, she tells them that her husband Anthony died some time earlier due to his body breaking down due to his cyborg enhancements.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #54. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The group soon encounters the powerful super villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], and quickly into the fight he nonchalantly uses his gravity powers to crush the Beetle armor - with Leila inside - into a small cube, killing her instantly.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Powers and abilities====
As Hardshell, Leila wore a powered suit which granted her superhuman strength and durability, and a variety of weapons.

As the second Beetle, her suit possessed artificial wings which allowed her to fly while also giving her superhuman strength and durability and different weapons.

===The three Beetles===
Three college students stole the previous incarnations of the Beetle armor during Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War event]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Fabian Nicieza]]|penciller = [[Tom Grummett]]|inker = [[Gary Erskine]]|story = Taking Civil Liberties|title = [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]|volume = 103||date = August 2006|publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|location = |page = |panel = |id = }}</ref> The individual piloting the first version was called Joaquim and the person in the second version was revealed to be female.

In those issues which made up a storyline named the "Guardian Protocols", they defend the city of Dallas against a plot by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] as members of an enlarged Thunderbolts team recruited by Baron Zemo and consisting of numerous [[supervillain]]s.{{issue|date=January 2013}} When the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] lets the full power of the Wellspring (the source of power the Grandmaster is using) loose when he attempts to revive Baron Zemo, the defenders of Sydney and Dallas are overrun, with the three Beetles presumably among them.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

In 2007, the three Beetles were identified among the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-26 |title=''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map |publisher=Marvel.com |access-date=2010-09-13 }}</ref>

''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update'' #5 revealed that the three college students that wear the three Beetle armors are named '''Joaquim Robichaux''', '''Elizabeth Vaughn''' and '''Gary Quinn'''.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' Update #5.

In this appearance, her first name is revealed to be Janice,<ref>''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and is later revealed to be the daughter of [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]].<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Beetle features as one of the main characters in ''The [[Superior Foes of Spider-Man]]''. Janice's origin is later recounted, where it is shown that as a child, she idolized her father and his criminal activities, but was forbidden to take part in them. After building a successful career as a defense attorney, she was appointed to defend Baron Zemo, at which point she volunteered to work for him as the new Beetle. Janice's armor is also revealed to have been built by the [[Fixer (Marvel Comics)|Fixer]].<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Hobgoblin's Beetle===
[[Roderick Kingsley]] had sold one of Abner Jenkins's old Beetle armors and gear to an unnamed criminal. He was seen at the Bar With No Name attending the wake of [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s servant [[Francine Frye]]. Beetle was later seen at the Bar With No Name among the patrons who want the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] to be the Queen of the Criminal Underworld.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Hobgoblin later regained the services of Beetle.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 6 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==

===Marvel UK===

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Beetle is a mysterious unnamed mercenary from [[Latveria]] with a completely revamped armor. [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] first finds Beetle robbing a sample of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] from [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]. This doesn't go well for Venom and the resulting battle left the Venom sample useless for Beetle to bring to Latveria.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #124. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Beetle later breaks into [[Bolivar Trask]]'s lab where [[Eddie Brock#Ultimate Marvel|Eddie Brock]] is held, leading to Venom chasing after Beetle. Just as Beetle is cornered, Venom is stopped by Spider-Man. When the Venom symbiote leaves Brock and attaches to Spider-Man, Beetle escapes in the confusion.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #125-126. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Disguised as a civilian which Brock least expected, Beetle later captures Venom in [[Central Park]] and flies off with him in order to deliver Venom to Latveria.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]]|penciller = [[Stuart Immonen]]|inker = [[Wade Von Grawbadger]]| story = |title = Ultimate Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #128|date = January 2009|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = |page = |panel = |id = }}</ref>
