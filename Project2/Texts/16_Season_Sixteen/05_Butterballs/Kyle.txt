Where's your lunch, Butters? Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters. Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her? <poem><i>Pansy.</i></poem> He doesn't wanna do it, dude.  Why are you doing this, Stan? You're gonna stop bullying. With Cartman singing about his vagina. Don't, ''don't'' act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you! Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego.  Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker? I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put all over signs as the poster child for bullying? Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him, and neither do you! What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom! Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them. If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!  If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet, for free?!
