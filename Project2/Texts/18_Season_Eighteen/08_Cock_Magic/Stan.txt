Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls' volleyball.  Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked. Shhh! What's that? This late? It was seriously almost hard to watch.   Wendy, did you hear about last night? Not that. Did you actually go to that? Pfft, whatever. We're men. Uhhh, Mitchell the Janitor sent us? That was freakin' hardcore. It was just decimation. Hell yeah!  What's mean about it? Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard. Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster. Dad, it's not that big a deal. Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic. Do you think they're happy? Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?  Hey, how about this little guy? Yeah! Gee, thanks! Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit. Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.  What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage? Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?! What did he play? Did he tap all his mana? Does an Overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?!  Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys. A way to finally do something good for other people.
