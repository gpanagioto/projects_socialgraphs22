 Hey, dudes. What are you doin'? Uhwuwhat? No-o-o-o-o! Oh good. I don't? I am not! I'm gonna go ask my mom!   Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell? Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell. We don't? But what if we're wrong? Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If ''we're'' wrong, we burn in hell. Well, you guys can do what you want! ''I'm'' going down to ''that'' church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me!   We have to ask you something. Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?  Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. ''Please.'' HAAAAH!
