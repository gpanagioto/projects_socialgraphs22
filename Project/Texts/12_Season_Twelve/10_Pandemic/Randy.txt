  There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?  Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot.  There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?  Huh?  Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.  Ohhh this is good! Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday. What the hell was that?  Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here!  Get back to your room, Shelly!  What's going on? What are?! What did that?!  Oh my Gohhhd!  Startled. HAAA!
