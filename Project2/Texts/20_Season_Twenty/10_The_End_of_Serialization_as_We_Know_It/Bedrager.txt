Oh, no, you don't. I'm ten steps ahead of you! What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh? What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to? You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious? How is not satirical? That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter. Oh, come on! So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous! So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire. Noooooo!!!
