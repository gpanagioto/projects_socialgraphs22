Hey. Hey there.  The name's Ugly Bob. Oh, the giant! Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh? Who? The Native Canadians? He says that the taking of the princess was foretold. He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger threat to Canada who has the princess. He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it. Aw, leave the kid alone, Scott. Don't worry. If there's one thing Eskimos are good at, it's finding things. Wait a minute.  Of course! The evil Atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay! It's coming for me! Help!
