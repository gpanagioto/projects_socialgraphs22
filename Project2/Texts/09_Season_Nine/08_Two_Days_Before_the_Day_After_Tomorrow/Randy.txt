 Boy, that's just awful. Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault. That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is.  Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen.  My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow.  With all due respect, clich√© dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow.    Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!  Come onnn, come on! No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.   Go back, go back!!  Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.  Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building! You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero! All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.  Stan?? Stan!!  Stan?? Stan, you're alive! Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age! What is it, son? You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!!  I'm going to Beaverton. My son is counting on me! You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death! All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find. Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia! Yeah, me too.  Don't be a fag!  We have to try!
