I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009.  Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but  Hello?  I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges. Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.
