Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig. Watch me plebeian. Hey dumb-asses. You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet? Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig. Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being. Good luck with your stupid little pig. Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone. Dad, you're the best. But he's our science fair project! But dad! I want a human clone. They're all stupid anyway. Come on guys, let's go. Hey, they've got our clone. He belongs to us. Daddy! Nooooo! You cheating bastards. This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow. Thank you Mr. Garrison. Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man. I present to you, the five-assed monkey.
