Hey, babe, what's up?  What are you doing? What are you pissed off about?  So you're just gonna be passive-aggressive again and not talk about what you're feeling?  You were clearly mad about something. You should just tell me when you're mad. Why do you act like this all the time? You were the one who was pissed off, you're the one being passive-aggressive again! Because you don't know how to talk about how you're feeling!  Oh... So you do have your phone. Okay, I just thought you said mobile phones are the devil. Uh, what? No, it's not that. Relationships are 50/50, Eric. We both have to make it work. We have to communicate to make sure that we respect each other's feelings. That's the only- What did you say?! That's what I'm talking about. You wanna be heard, but you don't wanna listen. Don't apologize if you don't mean it.  I love you too. Hi, Mrs. Cartman. Is Eric home? Okay.  Could you just tell him that... I want to make him happy? That I was wrong to say a relationship is 50/50. It's 100/100. And that I'll start putting in a hundred percent every day. Could you tell him I'm gonna try a lot harder? Thank you.  And could you let him know it's okay to be sad? Because the sun will come out again. What? Eric, I'm so confused.
