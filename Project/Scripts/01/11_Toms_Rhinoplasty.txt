South Park Elementary, the classroom.

Wendy

Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day.

Stan

I know.

Wendy

Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.

+++++


Some sentimental music plays.

Stan

I can't afford a cruise, dude.

Wendy

I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise.

+++++


Cartman roars with hysterical laughter.

Stan

Shut up, Cartman!

Cartman

[still laughing] That is so-ho lame!

+++++


He settles down and wipes away some tears of joy.

Cartman

Oh man, I...

Wendy

 -and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.

+++++


Cartman is roaring with laughter once again and falls off his chair.

Cartman

Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.

Principal Victoria

[Rushing in.] Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.

+++++


The class erupts in cheers.

Principal Victoria

So you're going to have a substitute teacher.

+++++


The class sighs.

Principal Victoria

And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.

+++++


Kyle raises his hand.

Principal Victoria

Yes, little boy?

Kyle

We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.

Principal Victoria

...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen.

+++++


She enters and stands before the class.

Ms. Ellen

[Brightly.] Hello, children.

+++++


The boys perk up.

Stan, Kyle

Whoa!

Cartman

[Slowly.] Wow, she's pretty.

Kenny

(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)

Stan

You can say that again.

Kenny

(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)

Principal Victoria

Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay.

+++++


Principal Victoria places it next to the apple.

Ms. Ellen

Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.

+++++


The boys get dreamy and smile big, even Kenny.

Ms. Ellen

Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,

+++++


The boys are in love.

Ms. Ellen

...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us.

+++++


Wendy starts to notice.

Wendy

[Gasps.] Stan? Stan?!

Ms. Ellen

Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?

Cartman

[Brightly.] Yes, ma'am.

Ms. Ellen

Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.

Stan

Yeu-bluuuch.

+++++


Wendy is taken aback. Stan has barfed only for her before.

Ms. Ellen

[A moment later.] Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?

Cartman

Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.

Stan

I'll kick your ass, Cartman!

+++++


Wendy is sad.

Ms. Ellen

So you're alright?

Stan

Bluuuch.

+++++


Wendy looks forward, wondering why...

Kyle

Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!

+++++


Tom's Rhinoplasty

Mr. Garrison

Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes.

Tom

You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want.

+++++


Tom touches the screen, and Mr. Garrison's face pops up, then a side view emerges.

Mr. Garrison

Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?

Mr. Hat

It sure is, Mr. Garrison!

Tom

Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this.

+++++


The nose on his image is shrunk.

Mr. Garrison

Hmmm.

Tom

Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this.

+++++


The nose is straightened.

Mr. Garrison

Oh, that's not bad.

Tom

Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this.

+++++


The nose is narrowed, at which point an image of David Hasselhoff appears. A flourish is added for effect.

Mr. Garrison

WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!

Tom

Alright-y then.

+++++


Tom resets the program. The computer turns itself off.

Tom

Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.

Mr. Garrison

I can live with that.

Tom

[Excitedly.] Alrighty then, let's get started!

+++++


They go off to the operating room.

+++++


The school playground. The kids are at play. The boys stand before the jungle gym.

Cartman

She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!

Kyle

Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she help but look at you!

Stan

You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!

Cartman

Until you puked on her.

Chef

[Approaching.] Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?

Kyle

Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!

+++++


Wendy looks at him from the swings, then looks down.

Chef

Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?

Stan

Yeah, that one!

Chef

Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.

Wendy

[Approaching.] Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?

Stan

No.

Wendy

Well it is!

Chef

That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...

Kenny

(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)

Chef

Thaat's right!

Wendy

Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?

Chef

That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...

+++++


Kenny looks up at Chef and simply shrugs.

Wendy

[Panicking a little.] Stan? We're still Valentines, right?

Stan

Sure, Wendy, whatever.

Kyle

Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents

+++++


He turns right and starts walking away.

Stan

Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!

+++++


Stan follows him out.

Cartman

I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners

+++++


Cartman's voice trails off as he follows his friends away. Chef leaves as well, Wendy takes a step to go with them, but stops and ponders her relationship with Stan. A tear wells up in her eye, then falls as she sniffs.

Female singer


I remember when we were still in love
The moments that we shared were timeless.
Saw it in the wind, knew it in a glance,
the songs we sang were simple reminders.




(Montage)

[Moments from Wendy's time with Stan, Part I (he throws up every time)]
Stark's Pond: she comes up behind him and says, "Hi, Stan"
Stark's Pond: she asks him to come with her (to get Cartman)
Cafeteria: she hands him a note (an invitation to Stark's Pond)
Cemetery: amid a field of dead zombies, she puckers up
Classroom: she hands him a daisy (he throws up with every step she takes)

Female singer


I can't stop now
[Wendy is still sobbing]
My heart's awake
I feel your arms
My arms to take
I must have changed...




(Montage)

[Moments from Wendy's time with Stan, Part II (he throws up every time)]
A vivid sunset: she snuggles up to him on the limb of a tree
Football practice: she cheers him on, he throws up, she looks away for an instant, and Cartman tackles him.
Cafeteria: he throws up as she approaches; she slips in it and falls flat on her back
Playground: Stan and Kyle are working those hobby elephants furiously when Wendy and Bebe approach (he threw up on her thrice a time)
Woods: Stan and Wendy pucker up to kiss (after they got Ike back)

Female singer


...Even when love is the same.
[Wendy sheds another tear, then turns left and walks away]




+++++


Classroom. Ms. Ellen is writing away on the blackboard. The boys are smiling broadly. The camera zooms in on the reason why. Ms. Ellen stops writing, but the boys are still smiling.

Ms. Ellen

Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?

Cartman

[Eagerly.] Memememememe, me!

Bebe

You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!

Ms. Ellen

Stan, how about you?

Stan

Bluuch! I'd love to.

+++++


Wendy turns angry.

Ms. Ellen

Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.

+++++


Cartman raises his hand.

Ms. Ellen

Cartman?

Cartman

What's a multiplication table?

Ms. Ellen

Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?

+++++


The class stares back. Kevin slowly shakes his head.

Ms. Ellen

Well, where did he leave off?

Cartman

We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while-

+++++


The door opens and Chef appears. The class looks at him.

Chef

Oh, hello.

Ms. Ellen

Can I help you?

Chef

[Eyebrows aflutter.] I'm Chef.

Ms. Ellen

Aand?

Chef

I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.

Kyle

My laundry detergent?

Stan

That's not Kyle's...

Chef

Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.

+++++


Drops off a box of "Whitey's Washing Detergent" on Kyle's desk, then walks over to Ms. Ellen.

Chef

What was your name again?

Cartman

Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.

Ms. Ellen

I'mm the substitute.

Chef

Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.

Ms. Ellen

That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-

Chef (falsetto)


[Music starts and he starts to sway]
Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!




Stan

We've got to learn how to do that, dude!

Kyle

Yup!

Ms. Ellen

That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?

Chef

If we can have dinner tonight.

Ms. Ellen

Fine, Chef. [He grins.] Just let me do my job before I get fired.

Cartman

Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!

Ms. Ellen

Wwhat?!

+++++


Tom's Rhinoplasty. Mr. Garrison comes to, but his head is still in bandages.

Tom

Mr. Garrison. Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

Where-eh, where am I?

Tom

The operation is over, Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?

Tom

You look great!

Mr. Garrison

Ah-I feel kinda nauseous.

Tom

Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, snapped some cartilage...

Mr. Garrison

Aauugh-huh.

Tom

...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart.

+++++


Starts making sound effects of tearing flesh.

Mr. Garrison

UUUUUuuuuuugh

Tom

By the way, did you ever see that movie Contact?

+++++


Mr. Garrison pops up and turns to the side of the bed.

Mr. Garrison

Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible!

Tom

I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest.

+++++


Mr. Garrison lies down.

Tom

I'll check on you a little later.

+++++


Tom walks out.

Mr. Garrison

Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father!

+++++


Classroom. The school bell has rung and the kids are leaving

Ms. Ellen

Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do.

Cartman

[Enunciating.] Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.

Kyle

[Looks back.] Stop kissing ass, Cartman!

Cartman

I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!

+++++


The students all exit, except Wendy.

Wendy

Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?

Ms. Ellen

Of course, Wendy.

+++++


Wendy sits next to the teacher's desk.

Wendy

I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.

Ms. Ellen

Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life...

Wendy

Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?

Ms. Ellen

Of course, Wendy.

+++++


They reach out towards each other. Wendy angrily flips her off.

Wendy

Don't fuck with me!

Ms. Ellen

[Stunned.] Wha?

Wendy

You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!

+++++


Ms. Ellen is shocked. Wendy drops from the chair and leaves.

Wendy

[Sweetly.] Bye, Ms. Ellen.

+++++


Day two, the classroom.

Ms. Ellen

Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me.

+++++


A pile of gifts sits on the teacher's desk. Smiles flash onto the boys' faces. She opens the first gift.

Ms. Ellen

Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle.

+++++


He's dancing blissfully in his sea.

Stan

[Feigning clearing his throat.] Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift.

Ms. Ellen

And here's one from Kenny. [She opens it.] Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage.

+++++


He laughs, sure that she got the hint.

Ms. Ellen

Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan.

Stan

Bluuch.

+++++


Losing patience, Wendy thumps her desk and glares at him.

Ms. Ellen

And here's another present...from Wendy. [She opens it.] Oh. Why, it's a dead animal.

+++++


Holds it up for all to see.

Ms. Ellen

Thank you, Wendy.

+++++


Wendy is now irate that Ms. Ellen didn't fold.

Stan

See? She liked my present the best!

Kyle

Where's your present, Cartman?

Cartman

Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home.

+++++


The left corner of his mouth tells a different story.

Ms. Ellen

Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now. [All gasp.] But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner.

+++++


The boys except Cartman perk up.

Cartman

Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.

Ms. Ellen

Are there any questions before we begin?

+++++


Wendy raises her hand.

Ms. Ellen

Yes, Wendy?

Wendy

When someone gets as old as you,

+++++


Cartman takes a bite out of the chocolate pie.

Wendy

Do they have to wear Depends undergarments?

+++++


Ms. Ellen looks dismayed. Wendy just looks back.

+++++


The Cafeteria. The boys are in line for lunch

Kyle

Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!

Stan

No you're not! I don't think I missed any!

+++++


Wendy approaches with Bebe, both carrying their lunches.

Wendy

Hi, Stan.

Stan

I bet I scored 100!

Wendy

HI, STAN!

Stan

Oh, hi, Wendy.

Wendy

I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.

Kyle

No, she wasn't!

Wendy

Yes, she was!

Stan

That's impossible!

Wendy

Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!

Cartman

Nuh-uh!

Wendy

It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!

Kyle

Oh cool.

Cartman

Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!

Kyle

Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.

Wendy

NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!

+++++


She realizes she has made a spectacle of herself as her voice echoes all over the room. Everyone in the cafetera looks at her. She moves away, humbled. Bebe follows.

Cartman

Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass.

+++++


They go in to get their lunches.

Chef

[Somberly.] Hello there, children.

Cartman

Oh, hi, Chef.

Kyle

How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?

Chef

Not too good.

Stan

What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?

Chef

No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.

+++++


They wait...

Chef

Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.

+++++


They just blink at him.

Chef

Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.

Stan

A whatbian?

Kyle

A plebeian?

Chef

You boys don't know what a lesbian is?

Stan

Kenny?

+++++


Kenny throws his palms up. He doesn't know, either.

Stan

No, explain it to us, Chef.

Chef

Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.

Stan

Oh.

Chef

Now move along, children, you're holding up the line!

+++++


They head back into the cafeteria.

Kyle

Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?

Stan

Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!

Kyle

Hey, yeah!

Cartman

You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.

Stan

You're just saying that, Cartman.

Kyle

Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat-ass.

Cartman

I am, too!

+++++


Tom's Rhinoplasty

Tom

Okay, only a few more bandages to go.

Mr. Garrison

Well?

Tom

Take a look for yourself.

+++++


Mr. Garrison takes the mirror and sees a reflection of himself - as David Hasselhoff. He will look this way from now on.

Mr. Garrison

Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?

Mr. Hat

I think it looks great.

Tom

Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll really notice the difference.

+++++


Cartman's house, after school. He's on the living room floor licking the carpet. His friends enter.

Stan

What the hell are you doing, Cartman?

Cartman

My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.

Kyle

Really?

Stan

Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect.

+++++


He pops the CD into the stereo.

Kyle

And I got these killer Birken-stocks.

+++++


Stan and Kyle promptly join Cartman on the floor. Kenny studies them for a moment, drops down and thinks a bit, then starts licking.

Indiglo Girls singer


I woke up very early one Sunday morn...



Cartman

This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!

+++++


Sidewalk. The camera focuses on a pair of feet as they begin to move. The camera pans up to reveal Mr. Garrison walking down the street to the beat of Andy Gibb's Shadow Dancing. He stops by a woman in a yellow blouse and red skirt.

Mr. Garrison

Hi, Mrs. Campbell.

Mrs. Campbell

[Breathlessly.] Oh, How-dy Mr. Garrison. Se-hey, honey, you look kinda differe-hent-huh.

Mr. Garrison

Really?

Mrs. Campbell

Did you get a haircut?

Mr. Garrison

No, but thanks for asking.

+++++


He moves down the street.

Mrs. Campbell

[Waving at him.] Call me! I'm in the book!

Mr. Garrison

Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us.

+++++


Wendy's house. Bebe is at the door

Wendy

Thanks for coming over, Bebe.

+++++


She follows Wendy to the sofa.

Bebe

That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?

Wendy

That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.

Bebe

Really?

Wendy

Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover.

Bebe

Oh, cool.

+++++


Day three, the classroom.

Stan

I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.

Cartman

I'm a bigger lesbian than you!

Stan

No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.

Kyle

Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!

Clyde

Whoa.

+++++


All eyes look right.

Clyde

Is that Wendy Testaburger?

+++++


Heads turn. Cartman smiles, Wendy had a makeover all right. She comes in dressed in a two-piece leather suit, blush, eyeshadow... A (candy?) cigarette hangs from her lips and her hair is feathered out. She walks in with an air of sophistication and then takes out the cigarette. A smoky tune plays as she enters. The guys in class are rather pleased at this makeover.

Wendy

Hi guys, what's up?

Cartman

Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John.

+++++


Stan smiles and his eyes follow her to her desk.

Stan

Wow. Hi, Wendy.

Wendy

Oh. Hi, Stan.

+++++


She turns to Bebe and whispers.

Wendy

I think it worked, Bebe.

Bebe

[Pleased.] Yeah.

Ms. Ellen

Good morning, children.

+++++


She, too, comes in wearing a two-piece leather suit.

Stan

Wow!

+++++


Wendy and Bebe are devastated.

Cartman

Dang! That's nice!

Kyle

Yeah!

Ms. Ellen

Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!

+++++


Wendy is mortified.

Ms. Ellen

We're like sisters!

Wendy

DIE!!

+++++


Stan rests his head on his hands and melts into a wavy smile while Cartman is overjoyed.

Ms. Ellen

All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-

Mr. Garrison

Hello there, children!

+++++


Shadow Dancing starts up again and he dances. The class just looks at him.

Stan

Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.

Cartman

Oh, weak, dude!

Wendy

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!

+++++


Triumphal music plays as she leaps out of her desk and somersaults her way to the teacher's desk. She lands next to Ms. Ellen, she starts doing a little cheer.

Wendy

He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now.

Mr. Garrison

Children, I have a very important announcement to make.

+++++


The class listens.

Mr. Garrison

I'm quitting my job as a teacher.

+++++


All gasp and the music dies.

Wendy

Wwhat?

Mr. Garrison

It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks.

Wendy

You...you can't.

Mr. Garrison

But the good news is,

+++++


Principal Victoria appears at the door.

Mr. Garrison

I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher.

+++++


Stan smiles.

Class

Hooray!

+++++


Wendy is deflated again.

Ms. Ellen

Really?

Principal Victoria

That's right. Will you stay?

Ms. Ellen

Wel...sure!

+++++


Wendy can barely contain herself.

Wendy

Noooo! Noooo!

Ms. Ellen

Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan.

Stan

Bluuch. Kick ass!

Wendy

Nooo!! Nooo!!

Principal Victoria

Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died.

Wendy

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

Principal Victoria

Oh, my! What an exciting day!

+++++


Mr. Garrison is in a photo shoot, posing away as Shadow Dancing plays.

Photographer

Great, baby, you're looking great!

Mr. Garrison

I'm a lady killer, Mr. Hat.

Mr. Hat

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

Photographer

Okay, just a few hundred more shots and we'll be done!

Mr. Garrison

A few hundred?

Photographer

Hey, that's the life of a model, baby.

Mr. Garrison

Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack.

Photographer

You've got it! [The photo-shoot continues.]

+++++


Dinner at King Jimmy's Buffet. Stan and Ms. Ellen are at a booth. Dinner music is playing while thunder rolls by.

Ms. Ellen

I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education.

Stan

Are we making love now?

Ms. Ellen

Excuse me?

Stan

They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.

Ms. Ellen

What are you talking about?

Stan

You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.

Ms. Ellen

Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends.

Stan

But why?

Ms. Ellen

Well first of all, you're eight.

Stan

It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?

Ms. Ellen

Oh boy.

+++++


Wendy stands outside the restaurant looking at the pair through a window clear across the room. The music takes on a somber tone.

Wendy

It's over. I give up.

+++++


She turns and walks away.

+++++


Day four, the center of town. Mr. Garrsion leans against a mailbox.

Mr. Garrison

Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.

Mr. Hat

You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

+++++


A crowd of women is heard coming Garrison's way.

Mr. Garrison

What the...?

+++++


The women appear and mob Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.

+++++


They rip open his shirt.

Mr. Garrison

Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself!

+++++


Mr. Hat flies out of the fray.

+++++


The classroom. Students are filing in and going to their seats

Kyle

So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?

Cartman

Did you make love?

Stan

I think so.

Cartman

No way!

Stan

Yup.

Kyle

Down by the fire?

Stan

Yup.

Kenny

(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)

Stan

Did I what?

+++++


Ms. Ellen enters.

Ms. Ellen

Good morning, children. 

+++++


Wendy approaches subdued.

Wendy

Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?

Ms. Ellen

Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?

Wendy

No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.

Ms. Ellen

Oh, that's okay, Wendy.

Wendy

No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.

Ms. Ellen

Well, I would love that, Wendy.

Wendy

And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,

+++++


Stan frowns. Sad music plays.

Wendy

...and I've learned from it.

+++++


Her eyes begin to well up with tears.

Wendy

I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world.

Ms. Ellen

Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!

Cartman

That's not what we just heard!

+++++


The sidewalk. Mr. Garrison is next to a trash can. His shirt and pants are torn to bits. The top of Mr. Hat's hat is missing.

Mr. Garrison

Hoh, Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job.

+++++


The women find him and rush towards him.

Woman

Oh my God, did he...?

Mr. Garrison

Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!

+++++


He pants.

Mr. Garrison

We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again!

+++++


He enters Ton's Rhinoplasty again, the women rush by, and he peeks out from behind the window. So much for looking like David Hasselhoff...

+++++


The classroom.

Ms. Ellen

Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting.

+++++


A commotion is heard in the hall, then Arab soldiers burst through the door and pour into the classroom with their swords drawn.

Leader

Down! Down! Everybody down!

Cartman

What the hell...?

+++++


Everybody drops down below their desks.

Leader

So! We meet again, Ms. Ellen!

Principal Victoria

And just what is going on here, mister?

Leader

I am Hakeem Korashki, of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government!

Ms. Ellen

It's a lie!

Korashki

She has killed thousands, and will kill again, I assure you!

Principal Victoria

Ms. Ellen, is this true?

Ms. Ellen

Nooo!

Korashki

We must take her back to Iraq immediately!

Wendy

Oh, coool!

Ms. Ellen

Principal Victoria, please.

Korashki

Here is a black-and-white photo of Ms. Ellen with our leader. [Shows photo.] Her real name is Makesh Alak Makarakesh.

Principal Victoria

Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!

Ms. Ellen

NOOOO!!

+++++


She grabs the scimitar away from a soldier.

Ms. Ellen

GET AWAY FROM ME!! UUGH!!

+++++


The scimitar leaves her hand and heads for Kenny. It pierces him right above the nose, picks him up, and pins him to the back wall.

Stan

Oh my God, she killed Kenny!

Kyle

You bastard!

+++++


Ms. Ellen is being dragged out the door by the soldeirs.

Ms. Ellen

NOOOOOOO!!

Wendy

Wow.

+++++


The kids take their seats.

Wendy

What incredible irony.

+++++


School entrance. helicopters are hovering around, an ambulance and Officer Barbrady hold the crowd
back. Stan is standing next to Wendy.


Stan

Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.

Wendy

Yeah, you just never know.

Stan

Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.

Wendy

Happy Valentine's Day, Staan.

+++++


She turns to kiss him. He turns to kiss her. Wendy's theme plays. They get closer, then...

Stan

Bluuuuch!

+++++


Right in her mouth.

Wendy

Eeewwww!

+++++


Wendy quickly wipes the vomit from her mouth, Stan looks away, embarrased.

Stan

Sorry.

Wendy

No, it's okay, Stan!

+++++


Stan looks at her.

Wendy

Everything's going to be o-kay!

Kyle

Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!

+++++


Cartman takes a big bite out of a cardboard box.

Cartman

Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.

+++++


Iraqi desert. Military maneuvers are taking place. The camera stops at a rocket waiting to be launched.

Korashki

For crimes against this country, you are hereby sentenced to be shot into the center of the sun!

Ms. Ellen

Egh.

+++++


She is moved to the rocket.

Ms. Ellen

This is all a mistake!

+++++


She is thrown in the rocket.

Ms. Ellen

This can't be happening!

+++++


She pops up, the rocket door is shut, and the rocket is fired up.

Ms. Ellen

Pleease! For the love of God!

Korashki

Shove off!!

+++++


The rocket takes off and heads for the sun.

+++++


Wendy's house, pool party

Mrs. Campbell

Wo-hoo-hoo! Great party, Wendy!

Wendy

Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher.

Mrs. Campbell

Anything for you, sugar-pie!

+++++


Wendy sees Kyle come up.

Wendy

Oh, hi, Kyle!

Kyle

I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.

Wendy

U-huh. Excuse me.

+++++


Some Iraqi soldiers approach to talk to Wendy.

Wendy

Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!

Iraqi

Ka fahra qetlaq humblaq! [Greetings...]

Wendy

Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!

Iraqi

Kuhla shaluah lakhenblaturtulah!

Wendy

Kaqemblaq!

+++++


Wendy throws them a wad of bills.

Iraqi

Ah, laqeh blakatah!

+++++


They walk away miffed.

Kyle

How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-

Wendy

Wait, wait!

+++++


She throws off her sunglasses and reaches down.

Wendy

It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing!

+++++


She puts it up to her left eye, then smiles. She is looking at the rocket fired off by the Iraqis some time earlier as it nears the sun. She sees the impact.

Wendy

Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.

Kyle

Wendy! You didn't!

Wendy

I told her. [suddenly gains white irises] Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!

+++++


Kyle is shocked.

+++++
