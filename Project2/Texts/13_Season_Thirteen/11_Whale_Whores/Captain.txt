That's definitely a Japanese boat.  Pull up next to them. The fight is on!  Are we ready to do this? Are we badasses? Are we badasses? All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media ''they'' did it? Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis? Why not? You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready?  Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one. Well no, that'd be illegal. We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
