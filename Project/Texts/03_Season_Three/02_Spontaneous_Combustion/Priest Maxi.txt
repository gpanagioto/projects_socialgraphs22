The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays , the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy… Now, let us pray.  Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen.  Let's go- Broncos Let’s go Broncos Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately. You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you? Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night? It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ. Huh? Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys.  Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little "nervous" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh? Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, ''and'' things.  Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus!
