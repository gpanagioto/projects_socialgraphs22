==Powers and abilities==
Misty Knight is a highly skilled combatant who, in addition to her police-combat training, is proficient in [[martial arts]] and possesses near-perfect aim with firearms. She is a superb detective, having graduated at the top of her class at the police academy and earned a degree in criminology from the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].<ref>''Iron Fist'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her bionic arm is superhumanly strong, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. Since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.

Her original bionic right arm was constructed from steel, and designed by Stark International. Her new arm was built by [[Stark Industries]] and is an alloy of [[vibranium|Antarctic vibranium]] and [[diamond]]; at close range it can liquefy all known metals, including [[adamantium]]. It is now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to [[Iron Man's armor]].<ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #6</ref>  It can apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #7 (2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Iron Man revealed the arm also displays technopathic capabilities, teaching Misty how to control a horde of robots.<ref name="World War Hulk: Aftersmash #1"/> Following her "pregnancy", Danny Rand spent money on additional features to the arm, including magnetism and a concussive blast.<ref>''Shadowland: Blood on the Street'' #1–3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A couple of new upgrades given to her bionics were shown during her hunt across the world for the recently resurrected Wolverine. Showcasing an energy shield to ward off incoming assaults with, a force field which she can expand over a marginal radius to help protect multiple people if need be. It even has a deployed grapple line within the forearm for use as an extension to reach and grab objects a good distance away. Often useful for latching onto and swinging from place to place with or to escape deadly falls from great heights.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
