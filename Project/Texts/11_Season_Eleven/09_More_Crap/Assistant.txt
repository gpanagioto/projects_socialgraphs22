Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first.  Okay, take a deep breath.  Sure.  I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester. The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!
