Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to-  Oh, not this kid again. What? Jesus Christ,  Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents! Whatever. Then we'll just put you in-   All right, stop it! What's in here?  Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have? You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world!   Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante! Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail.
