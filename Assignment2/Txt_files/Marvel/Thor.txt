'''Thor Odinson''', more commonly known as '''Thor''', and sometimes by his title as the '''God of Thunder''', is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[Chris Hemsworth]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|of the same name]] and the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] god [[Thor|of the same name]]. In the MCU, he is depicted as one of the most powerful [[Asgardians (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgardians]], an ancient alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who humans consider to be [[Norse gods|gods]]. Thor wields a powerful hammer called [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Mjolnir]], and is initially depicted as the arrogant heir to the throne of Asgard whose brash behaviors causes turmoil among the [[Nine Realms]] under Asgard's protection. This brings him into conflict with his villainous adopted brother, [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]. Thor commits himself to the protection of Earth, and becomes a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. Thor eventually becomes the King of Asgard after [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]]'s death, but the entire realm is destroyed during the battle with his sister [[Hela (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hela]]. Thor then comes into conflict with [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]], who slaughters half of the Asgardians and uses the [[Infinity Stones]] to erase half of the life in the universe before Thor himself kills Thanos. Thor later joins his fellow Avengers in obtaining the Stones from the past using [[time travel]] and they successfully undo Thanos' actions. When an alternate version of Thanos enters their timeline, Thor and his allies manage to defeat him. Thor then passes the crown of [[New Asgard]] to [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]] and joins the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. Thor later comes into conflict with [[Gorr (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gorr the God Butcher]] and the Olympian god [[Zeus (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Zeus]], while reconnecting with his terminally ill ex-girlfriend, the now Mjolnir-wielding [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]]. After Foster succumbs to her cancer to assist in Gorr's defeat, Thor adopts the latter's daughter, Love.   

{{As of|2022}}, Thor is a central figure of the MCU, having appeared in eight films, the most-recent being ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022). Although the first two ''Thor'' films have been among the less well-received films in the MCU, ''Thor: Ragnarok'', with its substantial reinvention of the character, has been held up as one of the best MCU films and often credited as positively rebooting Thor and his storyline, and the reception of his character has become much more favorable.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abad-Santos |first1=Alex |title=Thor: Ragnarok finally makes Thor a hero worth rooting for |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/26/16537186/thor-ragnarok-review |website=vox.com |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=November 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Chitwood |first1=Adam |title=How the MCU Was Made: 'Thor: Ragnarok' and How Marvel Rebooted Its Own Franchise |url=https://collider.com/thor-ragnarok-making-of-reboot-chris-hemsworth/ |website=collider.com |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=August 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Huver |first1=Scott |title=Ragnarok's Waititi Tried To Break Thor To Save The Franchise |url=https://www.cbr.com/interview-thor-ragnarok-taika-waititi-director/ |website=cbr.com |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=October 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Zoller Seitz |first1=Matt |title=Thor: Ragnarok |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/thor-ragnarok-2017 |website=rogerebert.com |publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=November 3, 2017}}</ref>

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
Thor debuted as a Marvel Comics [[superhero]] in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 ([[cover-date]] August 1962), created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].{{sfn|DeFalco|2008|p=88}} Kirby said, "I created Thor at Marvel because I was forever enamored of legends, which is why I knew about Balder, Heimdall, and Odin. I tried to update Thor and put him into a superhero costume, but he was still Thor."<ref>Kirby in {{cite journal|last= Van Hise|first= James|title= Superheroes: The Language That Jack Kirby Wrote|journal= Comics Feature |issue= 34|publisher= [[New Media Publishing]]|date= April 1985}}</ref> Lee and Kirby included Thor in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team.<{{sfn|DeFalco|2008|p=94}} A live-action television adaptation of the comic book character first appeared in the 1988 [[television film]] ''[[The Incredible Hulk Returns]]''.<ref name="Goldman">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/25/the-avengers-thors-tv-history|title= The Avengers: Thor's TV History|first= Eric|last= Goldman|date= April 25, 2012|publisher= [[IGN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627071007/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/25/the-avengers-thors-tv-history|archive-date= June 27, 2013|url-status=live|access-date= May 26, 2013|df= mdy-all}}</ref> Live-action film adaptations of the character were thereafter proposed, but did not come to fruition. In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028215225/http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archive-date=October 28, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

[[Mark Protosevich]], a fan of the ''Thor'' comic book, agreed to write the script in April 2006, and the project moved to [[Paramount Pictures]], after it acquired the rights from Sony.<ref name="Thor budget" /> In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it "to be like a [[superhero]] [[origin story]], but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential. It's the story of an [[Old Testament]] god who becomes a [[New Testament]] god".<ref name="Mark P" /> Marvel Studios signed [[Matthew Vaughn]] to direct the film.<ref name="Fleming4" /> Vaughn then rewrote Protosevich's script in order to reduce the budget.<ref name="rewrite" /> In September 2008, [[Kenneth Branagh]] entered into negotiations to direct,<ref name="Fleming5" /> and by December 2008, Branagh confirmed that he had been hired. He described it as "a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario."<ref name="Branagh" /> In October 2008, [[Daniel Craig]] was offered the role, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' franchise]].<ref name="Craig" />

In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, [[Liam Hemsworth|Liam]] also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name="Hemsworth is Thor"/> Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included.<ref name="feigehemsworth" /> Hemsworth stated that he gained 20&nbsp;pounds for the role by eating non-stop and revealed that "It wasn't until ''Thor'' that I started lifting weights, it was all pretty new to me."<ref name="Shira">{{cite web |last=Shira |first=Dahvi |date=April 18, 2011 |title=Chris Hemsworth Gained 20&nbsp;Lbs. of Muscle for Thor |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20482931,00.html |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=May 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807124445/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20482931,00.html |archive-date=August 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Characterization===
Regarding his take on the character, Hemsworth said, "We just kept trying to humanize it all, and keep it very real.

We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier."<ref name="Warmoth">{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Warmoth |url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/08/23/chris-hemsworth-mike-tyson-thor/ |title=Chris Hemsworth Reveals Mike Tyson's Contribution To 'Thor' |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=August 23, 2010 |access-date=August 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224174325/http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/08/23/chris-hemsworth-mike-tyson-thor/ |archive-date=December 24, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor in the first film.

For ''The Avengers'', Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''Thor'' by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, "My body weight in protein pretty much!"<ref name="EOnline">{{cite news| title=Avengers Flick Update: Where's the Script?|last1=Malkin|first1=Marc|last2=Malec|first2=Brett |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b216448_avengers_flick_update_wheres_script.html |publisher=[[E!]] |date=December 17, 2010 |access-date=January 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805062220/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b216448_avengers_flick_update_wheres_script.html |archive-date=August 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> He remarked that Thor's motivation "is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . .

According to Hemsworth, in ''Thor: The Dark World'', "for Thor and Jane, there are some unanswered questions now, since obviously he didn't stop in and catch up with her in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.

Following his failure to kill Thanos in ''Infinity War'', Thor becomes an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in [[Tønsberg]], [[Norway]]. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, "I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time.

Thor is noted to have a number of character flaws, which occasionally drive events in the MCU. He is initially impulsive, invading Jotunheim, the home of the frost giants, in the first film. This leads directly to Odin banishing him to Earth, and indirectly to Loki's attempt to overthrow Asgard after Loki learns that he was born a frost giant and adopted by Odin. It is noted, however, that from this experience, Thor "emerges a more humble warrior".<ref name="Gardner-2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/thor-character-growth-part-one/|title=The Case for Thor Being Marvel's Strongest Character, Part One: Thor|publisher=[[The Mary Sue]]|first=Kate|last=Gardner|date=July 13, 2018}}</ref> The events of ''Thor'' also lead to Loki encountering Thanos, in whose service Loki invades Earth in ''The Avengers''. Although Thor's arrogance has been tempered since his first film, he still shows flashes of impulsiveness such as when he attacks Steve Rogers at their first meeting in ''The Avengers''.<ref name="Bath"/>

Analysis of the character from a feminist perspective has noted that Thor "might be a hotheaded braggart, but he never demeans women", a sharp contrast with the womanizing [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]].<ref name="Gardner-2018"/>

===Appearance and special effects===
Thor's appearance has changed from each film to the next. For the first film, Visual Development Supervisor Charlie Wen focused on mixing elements from the comic books with Norse mythology in creating Thor's costume, keeping the six disk-shaped adornments on his upper body, but "trying to maintain the Norse side of things" as much as possible.<ref name="Strom">{{cite web|url=https://marvel.com/news/story/15800/art_of_thor_charlie_wen|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405160102/https://marvel.com/news/story/15800/art_of_thor_charlie_wen|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 5, 2012|title=Art of Thor: Charlie Wen|first=Marc|last=Strom|publisher=Marvel.com|date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> The first design element that Wen attempted was Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, for which Wen created a number of possible alternatives, incorporating designs including "the traditional Thor hammer with the short handle as well as the Ultimates versions", from which the one Branagh chose "was the most traditional one".<ref name="Strom"/> For ''The Avengers'', Thor's costume was modified slightly to fit in better with other members of the team, and to make his movements and appearance in casual scenes more natural, with changes including enhancing the blue tones in the costume, and reducing the size of Thor's cape.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marvel.com/news/story/19371/designing_the_avengers_thor|title=Designing The Avengers: Thor|first1=Christina|last1=Pham|first2=Marc|last2=Strom|publisher=Marvel.com|date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> Various efforts to depict Thor dressed in "street clothes" like people of Earth have been criticized as having him look like "an extra in Cameron Crowe's ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]''".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Thor was born approximately 1500 years ago to [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]], the King of [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]], and [[Frigga (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frigga]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Ryan |title=Thor's True Age Is Revealed In Avengers: Infinity War |url=https://movieweb.com/thor-age-avengers-infinity-war/ |website=movieweb.com |access-date=29 December 2021 |date=2 May 2018}}</ref> He was raised on Asgard as the [[crown prince]], alongside his brother, [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]].

===Banishment to Earth===
{{see|Thor (film)}}
In 2011, Thor prepares to ascend to the throne, but [[Frost Giants (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frost Giants]] attempt to retrieve the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]], an artifact seized by Odin in a war centuries before. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Jotunheim|Jotunheim]] to confront Frost Giant leader [[Laufey (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Laufey]], accompanied by Loki, childhood friend [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]], and the [[Warriors Three (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Voltstagg]], [[Fandral (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Fandral]], and [[Hogun (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth. Odin casts an enchantment on Mjolnir, ensuring that only those who are worthy may wield the hammer. Thor lands in [[New Mexico]], meeting scientist Dr. [[Erik Selvig]], [[astrophysicist]] Dr. [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]], and Foster's intern [[Darcy Lewis]]. Thor resigns himself to exile on Earth, where he develops a relationship with Foster. Odin enters the "Odinsleep", a period of rest needed to maintain his power, and Loki, having learned he is actually an adopted Frost Giant, seizes the Asgardian throne and prepares to conquer the Nine Realms. The Warriors Three and Sif find Thor, but the [[Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Destroyer]] attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's selflessness proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Thor returns to Asgard and fights Loki before destroying the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Bifrost|Bifröst Bridge]] to stop Loki's plans, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss, but Loki appears to commit suicide when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to rule.

===Joining the Avengers===
{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}
In 2012, Odin sends Thor back to Earth using dark magic after learning Loki is alive and is attempting to conquer the Earth. He finds Loki on a [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Quinjet|Quinjet]], held captive by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]]. Thor takes Loki away, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. However, Stark and Rogers pursue Thor and after a brief confrontation, Thor agrees to take Loki to [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Helicarriers|Helicarrier]]. Agents including [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]], who were mind controlled by Loki, attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage and both are ejected from the Helicarrier as Loki escapes. Thor then becomes a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] upon returning to help Rogers, Stark, Banner, Romanoff, and Barton when Loki uses the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]] to open a [[wormhole]] over [[New York City]] to allow a [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] army to invade. Thor and the Avengers fight off the Chitauri and save the city. After Loki is defeated at [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Stark Tower]], Thor returns to Asgard with Loki and the Tesseract.

===Battle with the Dark Elves===
{{see|Thor: The Dark World}}
In 2013, having used the Tesseract to rebuild the Bifrost and bring the Nine Realms to peace, Thor and his fellow warriors learn that the Convergence of the realms is imminent, with portals linking the worlds appearing at random. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] alerts Thor that Jane Foster has left his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to go to Earth. Jane inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin recognizes this force as a weapon known as the [[Aether (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Aether]], warning that it will kill Jane, and that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy. The [[Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Elves|Dark Elves]], led by [[Malekith (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Malekith]], attack Asgard, searching for Jane. Thor's mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane, and Malekith is forced to flee. Against Odin's orders to stay in Asgard, Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who knows a secret portal to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Svartalfheim|Svartalfheim]], home of the Dark Elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother. In Svartalfheim, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded. Thor and Jane return to [[London]] through another portal. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. Thor then returns to Earth and reunites with Jane.

===Ultron and the Battle of Sokovia===
{{see|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}
In 2015, Thor and the Avengers raid a [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] facility in [[Sokovia]] and find [[Loki's scepter]]. Back at Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]" global defense program. After the Avengers host a celebratory party and Thor reveals he and Jane have ended their relationship, the unexpectedly sentient Ultron attacks Thor, [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], and the other Avengers before escaping with the scepter. The team tracks Ultron down in [[Johannesburg]], but [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] subdues them with [[hallucinations|hallucinatory]] visions. Following this, Thor and the team go to Barton's home to recover, however, Thor leaves them in order to consult with Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination. Thor and Selvig go to a mystical well, where Thor has a vision of the Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence. Returning to the Tower, Thor finds out that Stark secretly uploaded [[J.A.R.V.I.S. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] into a synthetic [[vibranium]] body captured from Ultron and helps activate the body, dubbed the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], explaining that the gem on his forehead is one of the six Infinity Stones. Thor and the team return to Sokovia where they engage in the final battle against Ultron and manage to defeat him. At the new [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]], Thor tells Rogers and Stark that he is leaving to go back into space to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events and leaves Earth using the Bifrost.

===Ragnarok===
{{see|Thor: Ragnarok}}
In 2017, Thor is imprisoned in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Musphelheim|Muspelheim]] by [[Surtur (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Surtur]]. Surtur claims he will destroy Asgard in the prophesied [[Ragnarök]], when his crown is placed into the Eternal Flame in Odin's vault. Thor escapes, fights and defeats Surtur and retrieves the crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök. While returning the crown to Asgard, he finds Loki still alive and posing as Odin. He takes Loki back to New York City. With the help of [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], they find a dying Odin in [[Norway]], who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, [[Hela (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hela]], to escape from a prison she was sealed in millennia ago. She appears, destroys Mjolnir and forces Thor and Loki from the Bifrost out into space. Thor crash-lands on the planet [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sakaar|Sakaar]], and is captured by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]], a former member of the ancient Asgardian order of [[Valkyrior#In other media|Valkyries]] defeated by Hela. Thor is forced to compete in the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]]'s Tournament of Champions and he befriends fellow [[gladiator]]s, [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]] and [[Miek (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Miek]]. After defeating Hulk, the champion of the Grandmaster, Thor finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. A video recording of Romanoff helps Hulk transform back into Banner and after convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, they escape through a wormhole to Asgard – but not before Loki betrays his brother, and is left behind on Sakaar. In the midst of the battle with Hela's forces, Loki returns aboard the Grandmaster's vessel, the ''[[Statesman (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Statesman]]''. He and Heimdall help Asgardians escape into the ship. Thor, facing Hela, loses an eye and through a vision of Odin realizes his true potential and unlocks his hidden powers but soon realises that Ragnarok is the only way to stop Hela. He has Loki place Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame, and Surtur destroys Asgard and Hela. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth, but they are intercepted by ''Sanctuary II'', [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]' warship.

===Combating Thanos and the Infinity War===
{{Further|Avengers: Infinity War}}
On a destroyed ''Statesman'', Thor is threatened by Thanos using the [[Power Stone (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Stone]], until Loki gives him the Space Stone within the Tesseract. Before he does, he calls on the Hulk, but Thanos overpowers Hulk and kills Heimdall. After Loki is killed by Thanos, Thor clutches his brother's body as Thanos obliterates the ''Statesman'' leaving Thor to die in the open space. Thor survives and is rescued by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] — [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], [[Drax (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]], [[Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mantis]], [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] — and they tell Thor about Thanos' quest to find the Infinity Stones and erase half of all life in the universe. Needing a new weapon, Thor leaves in a space pod with Rocket and Groot to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Nidavellir|Nidavellir]], and Rocket gives Thor a cybernetic replacement eye. They find that Nidavellir has been ravaged by Thanos and meet the dwarf king [[Eitri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eitri]]. Thor repairs the damaged [[forge]], and they work together to create Stormbreaker, a powerful axe that also grants Thor the power of the Bifrost. Thor transports himself, Rocket, and Groot to [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]] on Earth to help Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Rhodes, [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], and the Wakandan army in the battle against the [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]]. Thor is able to defeat scores of Outriders and uses Stormbreaker to severely wound Thanos. However, Thanos manages to activate the completed Infinity Gauntlet by snapping his fingers, initiating [[the Blip]]. Thanos teleports away and Thor is left to watch in horror when Barnes, Maximoff, Wilson, T'Challa, and Groot disintegrate.

===Avenging the fallen and the Time Heist===
{{Further|Avengers: Endgame}}
Thor, along with the surviving Avengers and Rocket, return to the [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]] to assess the damage. Three weeks later, Thor goes with Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Rhodes, Rocket, [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]] and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]] into space to Titan II to confront Thanos. After discovering that Thanos destroyed the Stones to prevent further use, an enraged Thor decapitates him with Stormbreaker. Sometime between 2018 and 2023, Thor and the remaining Asgardians settle in [[Tønsberg]], Norway where they create a colony called [[New Asgard]]. Thor becomes an [[overweight]] [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] as a result of his [[post-traumatic stress disorder|trauma]]. 

In 2023, Rocket and Banner arrive in New Asgard and urge Thor to return to the Avengers and hear their plan to undo Thanos' actions. Thor returns to the Compound, reuniting with the Avengers, and learns of the plan to time travel via the [[Quantum Realm]] to collect the Infinity Stones from different points in the past. He and Rocket travel to Asgard in an alternate 2013 where he meets an alternate Frigga, who reignites Thor's sense of purpose, and he regains an alternate version of Mjolnir. Upon returning, the original Avengers hold a silent mourning for Romanoff, who sacrificed herself to obtain the [[Soul Stone]]. After Banner restores the lives Thanos erased, an alternate version of Thanos from 2014 travels through the Quantum Tunnel and attacks the Avengers Compound. Thor, Stark and Rogers confront and battle Thanos. After the restored Avengers, Guardians, Asgardians, [[Ravagers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravagers]], [[Masters of the Mystic Arts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Masters of the Mystic Arts]] and the Wakandan army arrive, Thor participates in the final battle against Thanos and his army. In the end, Stark sacrifices himself to kill Thanos and his forces. Afterward, Thor attends Stark's funeral. While Rogers returns the alternate Stones and Mjolnir to their respective timelines, Thor returns to New Asgard, where he makes Valkyrie the new ruler and leaves with the Guardians of the Galaxy into space.

=== Fighting Gorr the God Butcher ===
{{further|Thor: Love and Thunder}}
After spending a period of time with the Guardians of the Galaxy and reattaining his muscular physique, Thor parts ways with them to respond to a distress signal from [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]]. Upon arrival, a beaten Sif warns Thor of [[Gorr (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gorr]], a being possessing the god-killing weapon, the Necrosword, seeking the extinction of all gods and that his next target is New Asgard. 

Dr. [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]], Thor's ex-girlfriend who is diagnosed with [[terminal cancer]] arrives at New Asgard in hopes of seeking [[Cancer treatment|medical treatment]]. Thor's destroyed hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]] re-forges and bonds itself to Foster, granting her its power after years earlier Thor had unknowingly enchanted it to protect her. Thor arrives in New Asgard just as Gorr starts attacking the town with shadow creatures. He is surprised to find Foster with Mjolnir but nevertheless teams up with her, Valkyrie and Korg to fight Gorr. The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping several Asgardian children.

The group travels to Omnipotent City to warn the other gods and ask for their help. The Olympian god [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] is unwilling to help and has Thor captured, forcing the group to fight off Zeus's men. Zeus injures Korg; in anger, Thor impales Zeus with his own thunderbolt, which Valkyrie steals during their escape. They then travel to the Shadow Realm to save the children. However, this turned out to be a ruse for Gorr to take Stormbreaker, which he intends to use on the Bifrost to enter [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] and ask for the destruction of all gods. Gorr manages to overpower Thor's group and successfully steal Stormbreaker. Gorr uses Stormbreaker to open the portal to Eternity. Valkyrie is badly injured and Foster ends the battle drained by her use of Mjolnir, which has exacerbated her cancer. Thor goes alone, using Zeus's thunderbolt to imbue the kidnapped Asgardian children with his power to fight alongside him. Foster arrives and joins Thor in fighting Gorr and destroys the Necrosword.

Admitting defeat, Thor manages to convince Gorr that all he wanted from Eternity was not to destroy the gods but to get his daughter back. Foster succumbs to her illness and dies in Thor's arms. Eternity allows Gorr's request to revive Love,  and he asks Thor to take care of before he dies. The children return to New Asgard, where Valkyrie and Sif begin training them. Meanwhile, Thor, now once again in possession of Mjolnir, continues to go on adventures to help people, with Love, now wielding Stormbreaker, by his side.

==Alternate versions==

===Losing the Tesseract===
{{See also|Avengers: Endgame|Glorious Purpose}}

In an alternate 2012, Thor and the Avengers are victorious over Loki during the Battle of New York. However, when the time travelling Tony Stark and Scott Lang from 2023 arrive to steal the Tesseract, they alter 2012-Thor's history when they cause 2012-Stark to have a [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]. 2012-Thor uses Mjolnir to save 2012-Stark's life, but the incident inadvertently causes Loki to gain access to the Tesseract which he uses to escape by [[Loki (TV series)|teleporting away]], leaving 2012-Thor with concern and confusion.
===Throg===
{{See also|Loki (TV series)}}
{{Further|Journey into Mystery (Loki)}}

In an alternate reality, Thor (voiced by [[Chris Hemsworth]])<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nelson |first=Jeff |date=July 10, 2021 |title=Chris Hemsworth's Loki Cameo As Frog Thor Revealed By Director |url=https://screenrant.com/loki-show-chris-hemsworth-cameo-frog-thor-details/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210710201947/https://screenrant.com/loki-show-chris-hemsworth-cameo-frog-thor-details/ |archive-date=July 10, 2021 |access-date=July 10, 2021 |website=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref> is turned into a frog and is later sent to the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Void|Void]] by the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA). This version is dubbed "[[Throg]]".

===''What If...?''===
{{See also|What If...? (TV series)}}

Several [[parallel universes in fiction|alternate versions]] of Thor appear in the animated series ''What If...?'', with Hemsworth reprising his role.

====Death of the Avengers====
{{Further|What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?}}
In an alternate 2011, while seeking Mjolnir at a S.H.I.E.L.D. base following his banishment from Asgard, Thor is seemingly shot dead by [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] by accident, though it is later revealed that his death was orchestrated by a vengeful [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] in his Yellowjacket alias.

====Party Prince====
{{Further|What If... Thor Were an Only Child?|What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?}}
In another alternate 2011, Thor is raised as an only child due to Odin giving an infant Loki back to Laufey and grows up to be a boisterous prince who prefers spending his time partying. While Odin falls into the Odinsleep and Frigga visits her sisters, Thor hosts a large intergalactic party on Earth in [[Las Vegas]], with attendees including [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)#Frost Giant prince|a version of Loki]] who is a Prince of the Frost Giants and good friends with Thor, the Sovereign, the Ravagers, Surtur, Korg, Nebula, Drax, the Grandmaster, and Howard the Duck. In response, S.H.I.E.L.D. Acting Director [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]] summons Danvers for assistance, but Thor refuses to leave and the two engage in a battle. Thor subdues Danvers and continues partying with his fellow alien partygoers, destroying human relics and locations such as [[Stonehenge]] and the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Thor also meets Foster and establishes a romantic relationship with her. While he is partying, she contacts Frigga to discipline Thor before he kills danvers and does more damage. Thor is alerted to Frigga's impending arrival and intimidates his partygoers to clean up the damage they caused when he mentions that Frigga is coming. They succeed in undoing the damages. Frigga arrives to find him studying with his fellow Asgardians and the Midgardians. When he calls forth Mjolnir, he finds it defaced as Frigga shakes her head. Afterward, Thor visits Foster at her van and invites her on a date, only to be interrupted by an [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] from another universe wielding the [[Infinity Stones]]. 

As he then fights off the Ultron Sentries, he is recruited by the [[Watcher (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Watcher]] into the [[Guardians of the Multiverse]] to defeat Ultron. While in another universe, Thor accidentally alerts Ultron to their presence prematurely, and are transported to Ultron's home universe following a brief battle. Joined by [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], the team fights Ultron and manage to defeat him, and Thor returns to his home reality and reunites with Foster.

====Ultron's conquest====
{{Further|What If... Ultron Won?}}
In an alternate 2015, Thor, along with Stark, Rogers, and Banner, are killed by [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] who had successfully uploaded his consciousness into a new Vibranium body.

==Differences from the comic books==
A major divergence from the comic books is the absence of Thor's comic book alter ego, Donald Blake,<ref name="Bath">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/things-wrong-thor-everyone-chooses-ignore/|title=20 Things Wrong With Thor Everyone Chooses To Ignore|first=Dave|last=Bath|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|date=October 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Bacon">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-movies-not-adapt-comics/|title=The MCU Isn't Pretending To Adapt Marvel Comics Stories Any More|first=Thomas|last=Bacon|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|date=August 28, 2018}}</ref> although he uses the name 'Donald Blake' as a [[pseudonym]] during his time on Earth in ''Thor'', an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] homage to the comics.<ref name="Donald Blake" /> In the comics, as in the MCU, Odin stripped Thor of his powers and sent him to Earth as punishment for Thor's arrogance and intemperance. However, in the comics, Odin puts Thor into the body of Donald Blake, a crippled human doctor, for the course of a long-running storyline, encompassing years of adventures during which Thor's alter ego is occasionally able to cause Thor to re-emerge to fight villainy. In the MCU, with no element of an alter ego, this banishment is resolved within the first film, over the course of days.<ref name="Bath"/> The lack of an alter ego also impacts Thor's relationships. In the comics, Thor's love interest, Jane Foster, is an assistant to Donald Blake. In the films, she has no prior connection to the character, and meets him due to her work as a physicist studying the type of phenomena his appearances generate.<ref name="Bath"/>

Another significant difference from the comic books is the destruction of Thor's hammer, Mjölnir, in the MCU and the origin of its replacement, Stormbreaker. In the comics, Stormbreaker is created by the dwarf Eitri by Odin's decree, to be given to the character [[Beta Ray Bill]], after Bill fights Thor in hand-to-hand combat to determine who should possess Mjölnir. In the MCU, Thor himself assists Eitri in creating Stormbreaker as a replacement for the destroyed Mjölnir, to use as a weapon with which to face Thanos,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/thors-stormbreaker-facts-hammer-left-out-infinity-war/|title=Thor's Stormbreaker: Facts About The Hammer They Don't Cover In Infinity War|website=[[Screen Rant]]|first=Rose|last=Moore|date=March 3, 2019}}</ref> though he does later retrieve Mjölnir for a brief period while travelling through time.

At the end of ''Avengers: Endgame'', Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy, also a different course from anything that occurs in the comic books.

==Reception==
[[File:SDCC 15 - Thor (19671916312).jpg|thumb|''[[Cosplayer]]'' portraying Chris Hemsworth's Thor at the 2016 ''[[San Diego Comic-Con]]'']]
While Hemsworth's portrayal of the character has received praise, Thor, as a character, was initially less well-received than other Avengers characters, and it has been stated that "before ''Ragnarok'', Thor was described by some as an ill-defined if likable meathead of a character, used primarily for punching and occasionally fish-out-of-water jokes made at his expense",<ref name="Moran">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/thor-ragnarok-saved-franchise/|title=Ragnarok Truly Did Save The Thor Franchise|website=[[Screen Rant]]|first=Sarah|last=Moran|date=September 1, 2018}}</ref> and that films featuring the character were "the studio's least fun franchise".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/26/16537186/thor-ragnarok-review|title=Thor: Ragnarok finally makes Thor a hero worth rooting for|publisher=Vox.com|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santosalex|date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> In particular, ''The Dark World'' was criticized for adding "absolutely zero development or growth for its main character", resulting in "little enthusiasm for Thor from either audiences or Marvel".<ref name="Moran"/> ''Thor: Ragnarok'', however, was much better received, to the extent that it has widely been described as saving the ''Thor'' franchise.<ref name="Moran"/> In his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' acknowledged "Chris Hemsworth's Thor, endearing despite some ragged material and the actor's seemingly limited dramatic range".<ref name="MorgensternEndgame">{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/avengers-endgame-review-a-marvelous-wrap-11556124677|title='Avengers: Endgame' Review: A Marvelous Wrap|last=Morgenstern|first=Joe|journal=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 25, 2019|access-date=June 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603163507/https://www.wsj.com/articles/avengers-endgame-review-a-marvelous-wrap-11556124677|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===''Avengers: Infinity War''===
Thor in infinity war was widely praised, for its themes signifying his losses, his journey as a God and his sacrifice for the people of earth and Asgard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/amphtml/avengers-infinity-war-spoilers-took-19-films-thor-now-marvels-mvp-190137859.html |title= Avengers Infinity War "SPOILERS" It took 19 films; Thor is Marvel s MVP|website=uk.movies|date=April 28, 2018|access-date=September 13, 2022}}</ref> Mike Reyes of Cinema blend stated "The quest itself is Thor's way of trying to build himself back up after the most devastating losses, and Hemsworth is most certainly game for that. Watching him talk things out with Rocket Raccoon was a quiet moment that pays off in the best way possible when he ultimately forges and uses Stormbreaker. After losing everything, Thor is severely desperate to get back in the saddle and be a hero again, only this time it's not out of youthful impulse. Paying close attention to his conversation with Rocket, you can see a bit more of the age and wisdom in his person, particularly due to the fact that Chris Hemsworth seems to have adopted more of the tone and mannerisms of Anthony Hopkins' Odin. We've seen the son become the father, and now he is ready to become the hero he was always meant to be".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2411762/with-infinity-war-an-avengers-movie-finally-gets-thor-right |title= Avengers:Infinity War- an avengers movie finally get right|website=Cinema blend|date=April 30, 2019|access-date=September 13, 2022}}</ref>
Thor's characterization, themes and symbolism  were praised by fans and critics alike, with many considering it to be best iteration of Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==="Fat Thor" depiction===
[[File:Chris Hemsworth as 'Fat Thor'.jpeg|thumb|right|An overweight Thor, as depicted in ''Avengers: Endgame'' (2019), colloquially dubbed as "Fat Thor", "Lebowski Thor" or "Bro Thor". This iteration of the character received both acclaim and substantial backlash.]]

The depiction of Thor as a [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and [[obese]] [[alcoholic]] in ''Avengers: Endgame'', and the subsequent use of jokes directed at Thor by other characters due to this, led to accusations of [[fat shaming]] in various editorial commentary and fan reactions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/30/avengers-endgame-cinema-fat-shaming|title=Avengers: Endgame was brilliant - but the fat shaming broke my heart|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 30, 2019|access-date=April 27, 2021|last=Christie|first=Lacy Jade}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/fat-thor-avengers-endgame-marvel-body-shaming-1411778|title='Fat Thor' Prompts Avengers Fans to Accuse Marvel of Body Shaming|website=[[Newsweek]]|date=May 1, 2019|access-date=April 27, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jennaguillaume/avengers-endgame-fat-thor-chris-hemsworth-body-positivity|title=What Happened To Thor In "Avengers: Endgame"?|website=[[BuzzFeed]]|last=Guillaume|first=Jenna|date=May 2, 2019|access-date=April 27, 2021}}</ref> Others indicated disapproval that Thor's emotional and physical state was played for laughs instead of being approached with more respect and understanding.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ahlgrim |first1=Callie |title=Why Thor's brand-new look in 'Avengers: Endgame' is problematic, especially when his story line had so much potential |url=https://www.insider.com/avengers-endgame-thor-fat-shaming-mental-illness-problematic-2019-4 |website=[[Insider Inc.]] |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=May 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/problematic-character-depiction-avengers-endgame/|title=There's a Seriously Problematic Depiction of a Character in 'Avengers: Endgame'|last=Hale-Stern|first=Kaila|date=April 24, 2019|access-date=April 27, 2021|website=[[The Mary Sue]]}}</ref>
