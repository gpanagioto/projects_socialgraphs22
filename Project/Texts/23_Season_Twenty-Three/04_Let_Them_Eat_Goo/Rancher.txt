What'r you doin' you sonofabitch? I'm the biggest cattle rancher in South Park. I made ma livin' 62-odd years before you fancy plant growers done showed up and put me out of a job! I got 300 cows that the world suddenly decided they got no use fer! What am I supposed to do with them?! Put them in a zoo?! What they gonna do now? Go start some cow circus?! Go make some cow TV show?! You are single-handedly making cows extinct! You got a plan for 'em all? Fine!  Yeah, don't worry. He cares about the environment, so he could figure out what to do with you. No, fuck you, sumbitch! They're your problem now! It's all done, sir. You'll have everything you need.
