Stan?  Stan? Cartman, what's happened? No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?! Arh! Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?! Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger? Cartman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on. Oh for the love of God! Stan! Dude, is that you? No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination. Dude, what's happening? Oh no. The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland. What am I supposed to do? Stan? Stan??  I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked! No, I don't! The decision was overturned.   Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls! Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke. Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head! Nothing.  They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real! No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls Huh?  Oh boy... Jesus, I can't do anything.  Uh, hello? Jesus?  Aah. Yeah, I guess. Hi Superman.  I know. Oh God... Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore. You have to stop! Because I-  Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am ''never'' sucking your balls,  '''''there!!!''''' Cartman, don't! I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary! I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
