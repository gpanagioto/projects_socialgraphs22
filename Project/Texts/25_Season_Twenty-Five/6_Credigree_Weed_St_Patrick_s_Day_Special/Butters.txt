 ''Loo loo loo! It's St. Patrick's Day! Looo loo loo! De doot be do!'' Okay, mom!  Ohhh dad, are you wearin' green or are you gonna get a pinch? Okay! Well someone's gettin a pinch today! Hey, Clyde! You got your green on! Hey Jimmy! Nice green pants! Tee-hee! Te hee hee hee!  Happy St. Patrick's Day, fellas! You guys all look very festive! Oh, I hope they put green food coloring in our milk at lunchtime again like last year!  Uh-oh! Hey, Kelly-Ann! What's going on? Looks like someone forgot what day it was! Ha ha! Pi-i-i-i-nch!  I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do anything wrong, honest! I'm so sorry! Please! It's just... Well, she had it comin' on account of the way she was dressed! Oh, jeez, I didn't know Kelly-Ann was a minor! Well, she didn't have a mining helmet or a pick axe or anything! But... But, sir, it's St. Patrick's Day. Yes! Right! Yes? Ugh... Okay... Oh, God...  Wul, it's just... I mean... What you're wearing. You know, it's St. Patrick's Day, you're not wearing any... You don't have any green socks on, do you? Ohhhhh God... I wanna pinch you so bad... No, ma'am, could you... Maybe put on some green lipstick or something? Well, technically, yes! I mean, St. Patrick's Day is a wonderful day where we remember a British Roman man who went to Ireland and converted the whole country to Christianity! And he used a clover to represent the Holy Trinity, so we're supposed to celebrate that by wearing green and if you don't wear green you get a pinch! See?! That's the problem! Nobody knows how great he really was. Oh, God... I didn't finger nothin! I swear it was just a tiny little St. Patrick's Day pinch! It was... It was like this!  Oh! Ohhgu!  Dear St. Patrick... If you're really up there... I've always done my best to honor you on this most holy day... You went to Ireland, and you got all those pagan worshippers to follow Christ. If there's any way... that you could help me now... just, like, send me a leprechaun or something... I will be forever your dark servant. Amen. Whoa...  Wow wee, are you a real leprechaun? Alright! Are we gonna bust outta here or what?  Pi-i-i-i-nch!  Whu... Oh, hey, fellas. Pretty good. What are you gonna do? I knew St. Patrick would perform a miracle to get us out of here! Just like when he was a slave, he will help us go free! It is not over! What did St. Patrick say when he was taken from his homeland and turned into a slave?! St. Patrick didn't give up! And when the Christians slandered him while he was trying to convert the heathen Irish, did he give up then?!  Yeah! You see?! The power of St. Patrick compels you!  Yes, now use your clover rays!  Uh oh!  Wahggh!  Ahghggh!  It's him! It's St. Patrick! Once again... I shoulda never listened to what they told me in church.
