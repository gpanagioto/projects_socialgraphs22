Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer. How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan? So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible. Yeah dude, nothing fun is free. Yeah. See ya.  Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies. Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into. Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times. What secret truth?? I didn't know you were depressed.
