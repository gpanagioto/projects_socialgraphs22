==Fictional character biography==
===Teen Titans===
'''Toni Monetti''' is the daughter of a former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[New Jersey]]. Around the time she turns sixteen, Toni's skin gains a silver sheen. At a pool party for her sixteenth birthday, Toni is mysteriously teleported away. She and a few other teens learn that they are half alien, their mothers having been impregnated by an alien race called the [[H'San Natall]]. The teens are part of a sleeper agent program created by the H'San Natall to defeat the super-powered beings already on Earth. The teens stay together, and with the funding of Loren Jupiter, become the newest incarnation of the [[Teen Titans]]. Toni’s ability to control bursts of silver plasma energy earns her the codename Argent.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

This group is seen in the crossover entitled "JLA: World Without Grownups". Argent and her allies are seen rescuing misguided children from the dangers of an amusement park that has no adult supervision.<ref>[http://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/jla-world-without-grown-ups JLA World Without Grownups]</ref>

At first, Toni is not a very serious adventurer. However, when teammate [[Isaiah Crockett (comics)|Joto]] apparently dies, Argent takes it particularly hard. She vows to become a better hero. When Mr. Jupiter disbands the team, Argent seeks training advice from [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. She accompanies him on a mission to stop drug runners, but when she finds out her father is involved, she decides to keep the information secret.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

When the Teen Titans reform, Argent is instrumental in initiating a membership drive. The team takes on new members Fringe and [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Captain Marvel Jr. (also known as CM3)]]. A possible romance between Argent and CM3 is explored but is abandoned after a particularly horrible date (CM3 is unable to cover the bill).<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 2 #10</ref>

After another battle with the H'San Natall, the team discovers that Joto is, in fact, alive. When members [[Prysm]] and Fringe decide to stay in space, and with CM3 having left earlier, the team decides to disband.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===The Titans===
When the original five Titans, ([[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Donna Troy|Troia]], [[Wally West|Flash]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]], and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]]), decide to reform as the Teen Titans in the wake of the Technis Imperative conflict (in which Toni had fought alongside the former Titans and the [[Justice League|JLA]]), Argent is invited to join.<ref>''Titans'' #4</ref>

Later, the Titans participate in another case involving the highly addictive speed drug, Velocity 9. During the investigation, the role of Argent's father as a distributor of the drug comes to light. Argent has to choose between her father and the Titans, and ultimately allows her father to be arrested.<ref>''Titans'' #10</ref>

Around this time, Argent is one of the first to fight against the [[Asmodel]]/[[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] entity in the "[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]" limited series. First, alongside Titans teammate [[Damage (DC comics)|Damage]], then with other superheroes, she helps fight a literal invasion from Hell in the streets of New York City. For her troubles, Spectre turns her eyes into squirming fly larvae. She and other heroes affected are restored by the efforts of the "[[Sentinels of Magic]]".

In the [[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day|''Graduation Day'']] story arc, a mysterious android from the future known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] attacks the Titans and [[Young Justice]], resulting in the apparent deaths of Troia and [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]]. After the funeral, Nightwing disbands the Titans.

When the Teen Titans are once again reformed by former members [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], and [[Beast Boy]], Argent is not invited. When this version of the Teen Titans fights against [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and all reserve members are called, she is present. She also joins the Titans in their battle against [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]] and saves [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] by stopping the blood flowing from his shoulder after Superboy-Prime rips his arm off.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later]], Argent becomes one of the twenty members of the Teen Titans who quit after a few weeks. Her look is redesigned, and during this time she dates and later breaks up with teammate [[Molecule (comics)|Molecule]].

===Final Crisis and later appearances===
At some point, Argent falls victim to the [[Darkseid|Dark Side Club]], and is forced to fight other captive metahumans at the behest of the [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] gods on Earth.<ref>''DC Column'' #136</ref> Argent is later rescued by [[Miss Martian]], who takes her and the other former prisoners to [[Titans Tower]] to rest. While there, Argent is offered a spot on the Teen Titans by [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], but declines.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #69</ref>

Alongside a number of other former teen heroes, Argent, Prysm, and Joto (now called "Hot Spot") later assist the then-current team of Teen Titans during their battle against Superboy-Prime and the [[Legion of Doom]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #99-100</ref>

During the [[Final Crisis]], Argent is one of the superheroes drafted by Green Lantern [[Alan Scott]] under ''Article X''.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #3</ref>

Following the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Argent is seen at the funeral for her former teammate and fellow Titan [[Damage (DC comics)|Damage]].<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Argent can generate solid energy constructs out of silver [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] (colored bright red in the animated series), in simple forms such as protective shields, daggers, and battering rams. While she initially could not fly, she could create slides and flying platforms to carry herself and others through the air. Her silver plasma energy is said to be of a similar wavelength to the green plasma energies of a [[Green Lantern]]'s [[power ring (weapon)|ring]]. In ''JLA: Rock of Ages'', Argent's powers in the future had evolved to become almost identical to a Green Lantern's, as she was able to fly and could create more complex energy constructs, such as an entire army of silver plasma creatures and make them act on their own accord but remain under her control.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Argent appeared in  the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode "Calling All Titans", voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]. She meets [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] and becomes an honorary Titan, but she is soon captured by [[General Immortus]] of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. Argent can fire crimson energy beams, and can use that energy to form objects similar to the abilities of the [[Green Lantern]]. The Argent in this series appears to be a [[New Zealand]]er rather than an [[United States|American]]. Argent has also been shown to have an interest in fashion when she asks Starfire: "''Does this come in black?''" when the yellow communicator clashes with her dark clothes. When [[Más y Menos]] unfreeze all of the captured Titans during the final battle of "Titans Together", Argent joins the fight. She is seen sending two energy beams in the form of hands after a fleeing [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Johnny Rancid|Johnny Rancid]]. Later, she is seen in [[Titans Tower]] and before the "battle" against [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]].

===Miscellaneous===
* She has also appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (2004 comic series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic (issues #34, #36, #39, and #41).
