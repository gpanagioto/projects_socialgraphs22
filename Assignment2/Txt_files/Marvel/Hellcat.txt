Following Patsy's high-school graduation in issue #116 (Aug. 1964), the title switched from humor to become a young career-gal romantic adventure.<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=Stan Lee | penciller=Al Hartley | inker=Al Hartley | title=Patsy and Hedy| issue=#116 | date=Aug. 1964 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|story=After Graduation...

Patsy and Hedy made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #3 (Oct. 1965), which established them in the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=Stan Lee | penciller=Jack Kirby | inker=Vince Colletta | title=Fantastic Four Annual| issue=#3 | date=Oct. 1965 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |story= Bedlam at the Baxter Building!}}</ref> The superhero-team comic ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #89 (Nov. 1980) revealed that the earlier stories were fictional works published within the fictional Marvel Universe itself, and written by Patsy's mother Dorothy Walker though based upon Patsy's own life and friends.<ref name="beware" >{{cite magazine|last= Miller|first= Jonathan|title= Beware the Claws of Patsy Walker: The Hellcat Cometh|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #40|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= May 2010}}</ref> The Patsy Walker profile in ''Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook'' #1 (Feb. 2006) establishes that Walker indeed experienced many of the events from these stories.<ref>{{ Cite comic| title=Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook| issue=#1 | date=Feb. 2006 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

''Patsy Walker'' #95 – together with the [[science-fiction]] anthology ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #69 (both June 1961) – are the first modern comic books labeled "Marvel Comics", with each showing an "MC" box on its cover.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comics.org/brand/36/ |title=MC (Brand Emblem) |publisher=Grand Comics Database |access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>

===Hellcat===
The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] feature in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #13 (July 1972) introduced the concept of Walker as a superhero.<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=Steve Englehart | penciller=Tom Sutton | inker=Frank Giacoia | title=Amazing Adventures| issue=13 | date=July 1972 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| story =Evil Is All in Your Mind! |volume=2}}</ref> Writer [[Steve Englehart]] recalled that Walker's cameo in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3 had:
{{blockquote|"struck my fan's eye by including her in the Marvel Universe. ... I thought it would be cool to bring her in as a real character, with things to do. Part of my 'training' as a Marvel writer was writing romance stories and [[Western comics|Westerns]], but ''Patsy [Walker]'' was defunct as a comic by the time I got there. ... Still, as a fan, I had collected everything Marvel, including ''Patsy Walker'' and ''Patsy and Hedy'' ... so I knew them as characters."<ref name="beware" />}}

Because the Beast feature was dropped from ''Amazing Adventures'' just three issues later, the storyline with Patsy Walker was temporarily abandoned.<ref name="beware" /> Walker was reintroduced in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #141 (November 1975), having resumed her maiden name of Walker, and accompanied the Avengers on a couple of adventures.<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=Steve Englehart | penciller=George Perez | inker=Vince Colletta | title=Avengers| issue=#141 | date=November 1975 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| story =The Phantom Empire!}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, she adopted the name Hellcat, taking on superheroine [[Tigra|Greer Grant Nelson]]'s costume from her discontinued identity as the Cat.<ref name="avengers144" >{{ Cite comic | writer=Steve Englehart | penciller=George Perez | inker=Mike Esposito | title=Avengers| issue=#144 | date=Feb. 1976 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> The name "Hellcat" itself had originally been proposed for Nelson.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|date= August 2006|title= Talking About Tigra: From the Cat to Were-Woman|magazine= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #17|pages= 26–33|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The suit's look was later slightly adapted.

In 2010, Englehart recalled:
{{blockquote|"I wasn't real interested in the Cat. I read the books and they seemed like pandering, frankly — not very good stories written to appeal to a demographic. Once [Patsy] entered the [Marvel Universe], met the Beast, confronted her husband — all that began to change the Patsy I had inherited to someone a little more savvy. By the time she became the Hellcat, she could stand back far enough to see the ironies in her taking over a feminist creation. But she was really more about jumping into the superhero pool than standing back. ... She didn't muse on the irony; she wanted to be a heroine".<ref name="beware" />}}

Hellcat joined the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] in issue #44 (Feb. 1977).<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=Gerry Conway, Roger Slifer, and David Kraf | penciller=Keith Giffen| inker=Klaus Janson | title=The Defenders| issue=44 | date=Feb. 1977 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| story =Rage of the Rajah!}}</ref> After several adventures with the group, she met the supernatural adventurer [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of [[Satan]], in ''The Defenders'' #92 (Feb. 1981).<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=J.M.

After appearing in occasional guest roles, Hellcat had starring roles between 2007 and 2009, thanks to artist [[Stuart Immonen]] and his wife [[Kathryn Immonen|Kathryn]]. With the impending relaunch of ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', Stuart was asked by editor Nick Lowe if he wanted to do a Hellcat story, which was spread across the title's first four issues (Sept.–Dec. 2007). Marvel remained open for a Hellcat miniseries, and out of what Kathryn first conceived as a "Hellcat Christmas Special", inspired by [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance car races]] in [[Mongolia]] and research on the [[Inuit]], came the five-issue miniseries ''Patsy Walker: Hellcat'' (Sept. 2008–Feb. 2009), drawn by [[David Lafuente]] with covers by Stuart. A tie-in to the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Avengers 50-State Initiative]], it features Hellcat being assigned to watch over [[Alaska]].<ref name="comicsreporter" >{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_sunday_interview_kathryn_immonen/ |title=CR Sunday Interview: Kathryn Immonen |last=Spurgeon |first=Tom |date=30 November 2008 |website=The Comics Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716111017/http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_sunday_interview_kathryn_immonen/ |archive-date=16 July 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref><ref name="comicbookresources" >{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbr.com/northern-exposure-immonen-talks-patsy-walker-hellcat/ |title=Northern Exposure: Immonen talks "Patsy Walker: Hellcat" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=10 June 2008 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222222450/http://www.cbr.com/northern-exposure-immonen-talks-patsy-walker-hellcat/ |archive-date=22 December 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref> Following this, she was an ensemble star and narrator, alongside the superheroines [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], and [[Monica Rambeau|Photon]], in the miniseries ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' #1–4 (Sept.-Dec. 2009), which writers [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and Tonci Zonjic had pitched it to Marvel editors as "''[[Sex and the City]]'' in the Marvel Universe".<ref name="marveldivas">{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960 |title=MyCup o' Tea |last1=Abnett |first1=Dan |author-link=Dan Abnett |last2=Lanning |first2=Andy |author-link2=Andy Lanning |date=9 April 2009 |website=MySpace Comic Books |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413195242/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960 |archive-date=13 April 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=10 April 2009}}</ref>

Walker became part of the [[All-New Marvel NOW!]] event in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 3 #2, when Jennifer Walters started her own law firm.

The [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] line in 2015 led to a new ongoing Patsy Walker title, ''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!''. Written by [[Kate Leth]] and drawn by [[Brittney Williams]], it attempted to combine the romance and superhero comics with a more comedic approach, which Leth compared to a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/25072/get_familiar_with_patsy_walker_aka_hellcat |title=Get Familiar with Patsy Walker, AKA Hellcat! |last=Helvie |first=Forrest C. |date=10 September 2015 |publisher=Marvel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220015722/http://marvel.com/news/comics/25072/get_familiar_with_patsy_walker_aka_hellcat |archive-date=20 December 2015 |url-status=dead |access-date=20 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.cbr.com/leth-williams-get-their-claws-into-patsy-walker-aka-hellcat/ |title=Leth & Williams Get Their Claws Into "Patsy Walker AKA Hellcat!" |date=2 October 2015 |magazine=Comic Book Resources |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302210453/https://www.cbr.com/leth-williams-get-their-claws-into-patsy-walker-aka-hellcat/ |archive-date=2 March 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=17 July 2019}}</ref> In it, Walker tries to establish a job agency for superpowered people following her dismissal by the She-Hulk, and also recover the rights to old ''Patsy Walker'' comics which have been republished by Hedy.

She praised Marvel for "giv[ing] us space to wrap up the story exactly how we wanted in 3 volumes".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbr.com/patsy-walker-aka-hellcat-series-finale/ |title=Marvel's Patsy Walker, AKA Hellcat Series Ending In April |last=White |first=Brett |date=February 21, 2017 |work=Comic Book Resources |access-date=17 July 2019}}</ref>

===''Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!'' and ''Civil War II''===
As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" line, She-Hulk eventually gets unable to afford Hellcat as an investigator and fires her friend, which also forces Walker to move out of Walters' office building (the same place where [[Howard the Duck]] works). Walker moves to the Brooklyn apartment of Ian, an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] who she met when he used his powers to steal from an armored truck. Ian gets a job with Walker's old friend Tom Hale (known as "Tubs" in the romance comics) and inspires her to open a work agency for other superpowered people. To her chagrin, Walker also learns that her old rival Hedy Wolfe has obtained the rights from Walker's late mother Dorothy to republish the ''Patsy Walker'' comics. With the help of [[She-Hulk]] and [[Jessica Jones]], Walker gets the rights back by proving that Dorothy was sedated and thus [[Capacity (law)|not in full mental capacities]] when she signed the comics off to Hedy, making it a [[void contract]].<ref>{{ Cite comic| title=Patsy Walker, A.K.A.

By the end of the [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]], Walker volunteers to undergo experimentation carried out by Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. Despite nearly dying in the process, she acquires enhanced strength, endurance, agility, balance, vision, and reflexes as well as razor-sharp nails. In between the second and [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third seasons]], she began training excessively and used her newly acquired powers to become proficient in acrobatics and gymnastics while also seeking to develop her investigative skills like Jones. Throughout the aforementioned third season, Walker goes from being a vigilante to a self-described. Consumed by the loss of her mother at the hands of serial killer [[Gregory Sallinger]], she gives in to her rage and begins brutally attacking, later murdering, individuals she deems as evil regardless of their actions or motivations under the belief that it is to make the world a better place by killing them. This leads to a confrontation between her and Jones, who is forced to apprehend Walker and turn her over to the authorities. Understanding what it means to be the "bad guy", Walker is sent by helicopter to the [[Raft (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raft]].
