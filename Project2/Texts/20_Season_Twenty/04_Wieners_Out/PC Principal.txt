Make no mistake! I want to be very upset. However, as a community, we have all decided that people have the right to protest the National Anthem.  But they did so peacefully and without malice towards others. I want you to understand something, ladies.  and the only difference is that their protest included physical gestures, then I'm body shaming! That's what happens when you sit out the National Anthem.
