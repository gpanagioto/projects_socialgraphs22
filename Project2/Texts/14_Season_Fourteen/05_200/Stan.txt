Oh God, you guys, really? This again?  You guys, stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff!  Huh?  Oh, wow it is! Hey, guys, check it out. Tom Cruise is a fudge packer! Then why are you packing fudge? Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge. For what? But, dude- I have no idea... Aww... he was packing fudge! It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar- Ooooooo... I saw him once.  Yeah, a while ago, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends. No, dude, it was totally fine. Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln... Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour. Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ! Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything. Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there! What? No, Dad, we promised that Muhammad would stay in the truck. No, you can't even show his feet. Muhammad, are you okay?  They want his power? Yeah, we said we'd take care of him. We made a promise... to Jesus!  Dude, we can't do that
