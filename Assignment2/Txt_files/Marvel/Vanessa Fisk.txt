==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], Fisk first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #70 (March 1969).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=136}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about Fisk's personal life and early years other than her maiden name "Marianna".<ref name="Marianna" /> Despite being married to [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]], the "Kingpin" of New York's criminal underworld, she did not approve of his criminal activities. At one point their son [[Richard Fisk]] became involved in a plot to overthrow his father's criminal syndicate after discovering he was the Kingpin.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

After the Kingpin had a near-death experience, Vanessa gave him an ultimatum; he had twenty-four hours to get out of crime, or she would leave him. The Kingpin was about to kill Spider-Man when the deadline passed, and Vanessa forced him to choose between Spider-Man's life or their life together. He chose Vanessa and spared Spider-Man as a result.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #197. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The two went into retirement in Japan. Kingpin prepared to settle his remaining business with his fellow mobsters by cooperating with the authorities and leaving the world of crime forever. This infuriated one of Kingpin's closest advisors, Lynch, who believed that Vanessa was a liability and had turned the once mighty Kingpin into a henpecked husband. When Kingpin's former lieutenants in New York caught wind of his plans to sell them out in exchange for immunity, they kidnapped Vanessa, who was in town to secure the legal services of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Foggy Nelson]].<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #170. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kingpin started a gang war against the mob in New York to rescue Vanessa. The mob bosses attempted to ransom Vanessa in exchange for the evidence against them Kingpin had intended to turn over to the authorities, but during the exchange, Kingpin used a sonic device to stop the criminals, and found Vanessa bound and gagged in a building. However, Lynch fired an explosive at Vanessa, in an attempt to deprive Kingpin of the thing that kept him retired and bring him back as the Kingpin of Crime. She was buried alive in the rubble and presumed dead, although she did not actually die.<ref>''Daredevil'' #171. Marvel Comics.</ref> As planned, this drove Kingpin back into the world of crime, although he found out Lynch was behind the explosion, partially due to a headache he gained, and took revenge by murdering him. He then forced the remaining mob leaders to confess to hiring the assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to kill several of Kingpin's men.<ref>''Daredevil'' #172. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Weeks later, Matt Murdock's alter ego, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], found Vanessa in the sewers. Being buried alive had left Vanessa amnesiac and mentally unstable, and she ended up taken in by a mutant who lived in the sewers. Daredevil ultimately used her as leverage to force Kingpin to order his puppet Randolph Cherryh, newly elected to the office of Mayor, to resign and to confirm to the media that he was indeed a mob puppet. After reuniting with her Kingpin had Vanessa, now-[[Catatonia|catatonic]], sent to a sanitarium in Europe to have her regain her sanity. This would take years, and Kingpin's organized crime empire would fall and be rebuilt during the period that Vanessa was [[Commitment (mental health)|institutionalized]].{{issue|date=June 2015}}

Ultimately Vanessa recovered, and she remained in Europe. When Kingpin was the victim of an assassination attempt orchestrated by her son, Vanessa arranged for Kingpin to be shipped out of the country to recover from his injuries, and cut a deal with his fellow mob bosses to divide up his recently rebuilt crime syndicate in exchange for a truce. Vanessa then murdered her son, who admitted to Vanessa that his motivation was to rid the family of his father, who he blamed for his family's troubles.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

Murdering her son had a physical toll on Vanessa, causing her to lose the will to live, which along with the injuries she sustained when she was buried alive, resulted in terminal organ failure. Blaming both Kingpin and Murdock, who had recently been revealed to be Daredevil, for the cycle of violence that had consumed her family, Vanessa faked the death of Foggy in an attempt to provoke Murdock into killing Kingpin while they were both in prison. When that failed, she manipulated the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] into posing as Daredevil, which ultimately drove Murdock to break out of prison to find Foggy's murderer and the identity of the man impersonating him, culminating in her confronting Murdock with an offer to clear his name in exchange for him clearing Kingpin, so they would be free to try and kill each other anew.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #92. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Though Daredevil refused this deal, Vanessa went ahead and arranged for the murder of Leland Drummond, the corrupt [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director who outed Matt in order to advance his own career within the FBI. To discredit his outing of Daredevil, the murder was made to look like a suicide and a false suicide note was planted at the scene, claiming that Drummond took his own life after it became apparent that his scheme to frame Matt Murdock was about to be exposed. Shortly afterwards, Vanessa died and Murdock was guilted into serving as the Kingpin's lawyer, getting the charges dropped on the grounds that the evidence was too tainted to bring him to court. Daredevil forced the crime boss to renounce his American citizenship and leave the country forever in exchange for his  legal services, stating that any attempt to continue their vendetta would be an insult to the memory of Vanessa.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #93. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kingpin is later seen at her grave where he breaks down emotionally. She has since been talking to him as a ghostly vision taunting him that he will never regain his former glory, an indication that her death still greatly affects him.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

The Arbiters bring Vanessa back as a revenant as a part of a test intended to gauge the Kingpin's worth as the head of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Zeb Wells|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Joe Madureira|colorist = Peter Steigerwald|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Jeanine Schaefer and Stephen Wacker|title = Savage Wolverine|volume = 1|issue = #7|date = 17 July 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Reluctant to combat her, Fisk tries to appeal to whatever humanity that she may still have left in her, and kills her when she still flings her weapons at him, unaware that she was aiming at the assassin approaching him from behind.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Zeb Wells|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Joe Madureira|colorist = Peter Steigerwald|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Jeanine Schaefer and Stephen Wacker|title = Savage Wolverine|volume = 1|issue = #8|date = 18 September 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

The [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] "reanimates" Vanessa in an attempt to coerce the Kingpin into allying with him in ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]''. The Kingpin responds by killing Vanessa while declaring, "That wasn't my wife. That was an abomination".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott|penciller = Javier Garron|inker = Javier Garron|colorist = Frank D'Armata|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe|story = King's Ransom|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 4|issue = #19|date = 5 October 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

After Mayor Fisk starts planning to have Peter Parker killed, as he is the roommate of [[Boomerang (comics)|Fred Myers]] who is blackmailing him, the mysterious undead entity [[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|Kindred]] appears in his cabinet. He kills Fisk's associates using supernatural abilities and forces him to back off Parker after revealing he is in possession of Vanessa's soul.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mayor Fisk planned to revive Vanessa by obtaining the Tablet of Life and Destiny and its sister counterpart the Tablet of Death and Entropy.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #58-59. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon getting his hands on both tablets, Fisk uses its abilities to revive Richard Fisk as Kingpin realized that Vanessa would not be pleased with her resurrection. He did this as an act of redemption for Vanessa and even himself.<ref>''Giant Size Amazing Spider-Man: King's Ransom'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
In the Marvel/DC crossover book ''[[Batman & Spider-Man: New Age Dawning]] #1'', Vanessa is infected with terminal cancer by [[Ra's al Ghul]], who offers the Kingpin the cure for it in exchange for his help in a plot that will destroy New York.

Vanessa is cured near the end of the storyline by an antidote provided by Ra's al Ghul's daughter [[Talia al Ghul]], who recognizes Vanessa as a kindred spirit, as both of them loved men that society would regard as monsters.

In the alternate universe of ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', it is revealed that she was not infected or eaten when the zombies took over the world, but has been secretly kept alive by the zombified Kingpin, who is able to control his hunger for human flesh when she is around, but when the Kingpin's clone factory is destroyed by [[Machine Man]] and [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], he consumes Vanessa.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2 (2008).

Later, in order to protect himself from the [[Punisher]], Kingpin hires [[Elektra (comics)#PunisherMax|Elektra]] as a bodyguard.

===Novel===
Vanessa Fisk appears in the novel ''Spider-Man: Forever Young'', written by Stefan Petrucha. She is featured in a retelling of the "Tablet" storyline that introduced the villain [[Silvermane]]. The novel is set two years after the events of the original storyline, with Vanessa approaching Spider-Man to help her steal the Tablet from Silvermane so that she can use it to cure her husband - currently in a trauma-induced coma - offering in return to use her family's resources to assist a seriously ill May Parker (aware that Peter Parker and Spider-Man are connected without knowing that they are the same man).  However, Vanessa later abandons the idea of using the tablet after witnessing what it has done to Silvermane, who is constantly aging back and forth from childhood to old age due to the mystical powers of the Tablet. Nevertheless, she covers May's medical bills as agreed, leaving a message for Peter explaining that he lived up to his end of their arrangement, and acknowledges that he is not at fault that the nature of the Tablet meant that it was far too risky to use its power on her husband.
