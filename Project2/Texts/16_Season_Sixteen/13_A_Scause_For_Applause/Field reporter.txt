Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together. Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use? Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus. Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right? Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?
