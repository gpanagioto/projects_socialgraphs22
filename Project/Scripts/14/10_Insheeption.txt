South Park Elementary, day. The students are all in the cafeteria eating lunch. In the middle of the cafeteria is a table with the four boys there. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit opposite Clyde, Craig, Kevin, and Tolkien.

Cartman

So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. [laughs heartily. Butters approaches the table with a sheet of paper]

Butters

Hey, Stan, I have a note for you.

Stan

A note?

Butters

Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this. [hands him the note] I'm like a mailman. [walks away. Stan reads and Kyle notices]

Kyle

What's it say?

Stan

[omitting the names] We need to talk.

Cartman

[voice rising in pitch] Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk.", you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.

-----


Two tables over, nine girls are eating lunch. Isla, Red, Wendy, Bebe, and Heidi sit opposite Esther, Anne, Lola, and Millie

Red

Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?

Wendy

Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.

Stan

[approaching] Is something wrong, Wendy? [Wendy sees him, then looks at the girls, gets up and walks up to Stan]

Wendy

[sighs] Stan? We need to talk about your locker.

Stan

My locker?

Wendy

[turns away] Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.

Stan

Are you serious?

Wendy

[turns back] It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.

Stan

Well, it's just a little messy.

Wendy

No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help, I don't know how much longer I could be with you!

Stan

Aw, come on.

Wendy

Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?

Stan

Yeah, alright.

Wendy

[wipes a tear from her eye] Okay. [puts a hand on his shoulder] I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.

-----


South Park Elementary, hallway. Two men stand by Stan and his locker as the fourth graders look on. One of them holds a large trash bag and is wearing a face mask

An Expert

Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan. [Stan goes to his locker, opens it, and a few items fall out. The class gasps in horror: Stan's locker is truly packed. Wendy cries and hides her face with her notebook]

Stan

What, come on, it's not that bad.

Dr. Chinstrap

Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.

Stan

My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.

Dr. Chinstrap

[walks up to Stan and gets down on one knee] Okay, great. How about we start with this? [takes a small box out of the locker]

Stan

Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.

Dr. Chinstrap

[defers right away, putting a hand up] Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this? [takes out a bent toothbrush] Broken toothbrush.

Stan

Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-

Dr. Chinstrap

But it's broken.

Stan

Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-

Dr. Chinstrap

[defers right away] Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box. [sets it down] Now how about this? [pulls out a clear sandwich bag with rotten food in it] Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.

Class

Eeeeewwww! [two more men stand behind the class holding trash bags and wearing face masks]

Stan

Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.

Dr. Chinstrap

It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?

Stan

Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-

Dr. Chinstrap

The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?

Stan

Well, I- I guess so, but- [Dr. Chinstrap dumps the baggie into the large trash bag his assistant is holding. The assistant is wearing a facemask] Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny look at each other worriedly]

Dr. Chinstrap

Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?

Stan

Well no, don't throw that out.

Dr. Chinstrap

Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? [sweeps out a bunch of loose papers. Stan gets alarmed]

Stan

[begins gathering up the papers] No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-! [takes the bottle from Dr. Chinstrap. The assistant pulls out the baggie] G-give me back my sandwich! [Stan grabs the baggie, then reaches for another loose sheet, when he realizes what he's done. Cartman makes a circle around his right ear with his index finger and whistles a cuckoo tune]

Kyle

[walks up to Stan and puts a hand on his left shoulder] Dude. What's wrong with you?

Stan

I don't... I don't know.

Kyle

Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.

-----


Mr. Mackey's office, later. Stan is in his office

Mr. Mackey

Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? [before Stan answers, he looks around the office. Mr. Mackey has a lot of junk in there]

Stan

Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."

Mr. Mackey

Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?

Stan

Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?

Mr. Mackey

Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?

Stan

[looks around again] Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?

Mr. Mackey

Me? ...Like, like what?

Stan

[looks around and picks up an empty milk carton from a box] Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-

Mr. Mackey

DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKING MOUTH! M'KAY?!

-----


South Park Elementary faculty room. Randy and Sharon are there with Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, Dr. Chinstrap, and another expert

Dr. Chinstrap

There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.

Principal Victoria

But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?

Sharon

Yes, our son has always been fairly clean.

Dr. Chinstrap

We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.

Sharon

Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.

Dr. Chinstrap

I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is. [turns away] It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.

Randy

Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.

Dr. Chinstrap

Oh no, really?

-----


A pasture, day. Dr. Chinstrap and his partner are present with Sgt. Yates and an officer

Sgt. Yates

Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.

Mr. Yelman

[a shepherd, or sheep herder, or sheep hoarder] ...Well I, that is I, I-

Dr. Chinstrap

It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. [Mr. Yelman doesn't know what they're talking about]

-----


A lab, later. Stan, Mr. Mackey, and Mr. Yelman are all on couches with electrodes attached to their temples. Dr. Chinstrap is running tests as his partner and Stan's parents watch from an observation room

Partner

Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.

Dr. Chinstrap

Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding, or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.

Mr. Yelman

Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.

Dr. Chinstrap

It's pronounced "hoarder," and yes you are.

Mr. Yelman

But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep.

Dr. Chinstrap

Yes, you are hurting sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.

Mr. Yelman

No, but I just thought that-

Dr. Chinstrap

Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.

Mr. Mackey

M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uh-kay?

Dr. Chinstrap

Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. float- [jumps out of his chair suddenly, startling the subjects] WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!

Mr. Mackey

What?! What?! Jesus, what?!

Mr. Yelman

Oh my God!

Dr. Chinstrap

Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second. [clears his throat] Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... now the cloud is near you, you... you reach out to it.

Mr. Mackey

[stretches his arm out] Mmm-kay...

Dr. Chinstrap

It's the cloud of your memories, of your past, [focus on Mr. Mackey] ...your childhood perhaps, ...what do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?

Mr. Mackey

Billy, ...Billy Thompson?

-----


Mackey's memory takes him back to the 1970s, when he was in grammar school. Three kids angrily walk towards him in the hall.

Billy

There he is! Hey, Mackey! [Mr. Mackey, talking to two other boys, suddenly drops his books and turns around]

Mackey

Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?

Billy

Come 'ere! [points to the spot where he wants Mackey. Mackey's friends panic and split]

Mackey

Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh...

Billy

You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.

Mackey

Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay? [Billy throws him up against a locker] Huhhhhh!

Billy

You're gonna die Mackey! [to his friends] Hold his legs! [his friends move in, but Mackey gets loose and runs away, screaming. Mackey rounds a corner, finds a room, and goes in before Billy could catch him. Billy and his friends round the corner and run past the room Mackey entered] Come back here!

Mackey

[in the darkness, starts to calm down] Okay. Okay, okay okay, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light. [turns on the light, revealing Stan]

Stan

What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?

Mackey

Shh. Be quiet.

Mr. Yelman

'Scuse me, where are we?

Mackey

Shh. You've gotta be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.

Stan

What the hell's going on?!

-----


In the observation room Dr. Chinstrap and his partner analyze some printouts

Dr. Chinstrap

What the hell is going on?!

Partner

The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.

Dr. Chinstrap

Oh Jesus.

Randy

What does that mean?

Dr. Chinstrap

It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.

Randy

What?!

Partner

I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.

Randy

Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?

Dr. Chinstrap

It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.

Pinkerton

Alright. [walks up to Randy and Sharon] Look, it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams. [Dr. Chinstrap begins a musical accompaniment] Send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who's dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back. [Dr. Chinstrap ends his accompaniment at the same time]

-----


Mackey's dream. Mackey runs into his bedroom, which is strewn with toys popular in the '70s.

Mackey

Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?

Stan

Mr. Mackey.

Mackey

[sees his Lite Brite, runs to work on it, and sings] Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay.

Stan

Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?

Mackey

Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay.

Stan

Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!

Mackey

Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll! [goes to his dresser and grabs it] I can take the motorcycle, hm'kay, I put it on this thing, like this. [puts the motorcycle on the little ramp] Okay now crank it back, and now I let go. [releases the motorcycle, which zooms across the room and does a wheelie. Mackey giggles with excitement] Okay. Okay.

Stan

Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.

Mackey

Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!

Mr. Yelman

Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.

Stan

I'm working on it!

Mackey

[Singing along with the TV] Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay!

Stan

[walks up to Mackey and turns him around] Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! [something hits Mackey's window and he goes to see what it was. He sees Billy on the sidewalk with his friends]

Billy

You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is the field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!

Mackey

No, uh Billy, please, uh-kay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.

Billy

See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! [walks away with his friends]

Mackey

[turns away from the window] Oh Jesus...

Stan

Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?

Mackey

Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay. [looks away]

-----


The lab. The patients continue dreaming and moaning

Stan

Oh-Ohhhhhhh.

Mr. Mackey

Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.

-----


The observation room

Randy

What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!

Dr. Chinstrap

Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.

Randy

That does it! [goes into the lab]

Dr. Chinstrap

What are you doing?!

Randy

I'm goin' in! [pulls up a couch next to Stan's] If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!

Dr. Chinstrap

Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!

Randy

Damn your incongruities! [hooks himself up] I'm goin' in after my son!

Dr. Chinstrap

It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!

Randy

I said get me in there!

Dr. Chinstrap

Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine! [snaps into a soothing rush job] You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.

Randy

Ahhh.

-----


Next day, the field trip

Bus Driver

Alright kids, everyone on the bus.

Stan

Wait wait, where the hell are we now?

Mackey

It's the day of the big field trip.

Billy

[from the bus window] Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya.

Mackey

Oh Jesus.

Stan

Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!

Bus Driver

Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!

Mr. Yelman

Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder.

Driver

It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! [shoves him into the bus]

Mr. Yelman

Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um.

Stan

Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.

Randy

Stan? [Stan looks around] Stan!

Stan

Dad? Is that you?

Randy

Yes, it's me, Stan.

Stan

Where are you?

Randy

It's me! Up here! [Stan looks up and sees him] I'm a butterfly!

Stan

The hell are you doing, dad?

Randy

I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!

Stan

Did you come here to help me?

Randy

I was gonna, but ooh! This is fun!

Stan

Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!

Randy

Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.

Stan

DAD!

-----


in the lab, Randy is smiling

Randy

[moaning happily] Aah ahhh aha ahhh.

Stan

[moaning in frustration] Aaaaaagh!

-----


The observation room. Pinkerton checks the printouts

Pinkerton

Uh oh, something's wrong.

Dr. Chinstrap

What is it?!

Pinkerton

The father. He's gone completely off chart.

Sharon

Off chart? What does that mean?

Pinkerton

We don't even know.

Dr. Chinstrap

I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.

Sharon

Who are the experts? [five men shooting guns enter the observation room, and one of them goes down with a gunshot wound]

Leonardo DiCaprio

 Get that door closed! Keep me covered! [the expert in striped shirt shuts the door]

Dr. Chinstrap

Ah good, you're here.

DiCaprio

What's the sitch?!

Dr. Chinstrap

Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.

Expert 1

We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!

Sharon

What next dream level?

DiCaprio

Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream. [Dr. Chinstrap resumes the accompaniment] We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream.

Sharon

Why?

Expert 1

[Black Suit (Arthur)] Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo.

Sharon

What's that?

Expert 2

[in striped shirt (Eames)] Empty scary dreamspace.

Sharon

So like a nightmare?

Expert 3

[African-American (Yusef)] No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!

Sharon

Why can't you wake up from that?

Expert 1

You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!

Sharon

That doesn't sound very difficult.

Expert 1

It is!

Sharon

Why?

Expert 4

Arrgh.

Expert 1

We don't have time for this!

Sharon

Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?

Expert 1

Then we go into your husband's dreams!

Sharon

Okaaay...

DiCaprio

But your husband will think we're in Hasselbeck's dream.

Sharon

Okay, wait. Who's Hasselbeck?

Hasselbeck

I am.

Sharon

Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?

DiCaprio

Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!

Sharon

Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?

DiCaprio

Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time.

Expert 1

It's so complex and cool.

Sharon

Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!

DiCaprio

You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move! [the five experts and Hasselbeck enter the lab and hook themselves up]

Sharon

Will they be able to wake Mackey up?

Dr. Chinstrap

If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.

Sharon

Why?

Dr. Chinstrap

Because.

Frisco Woods, day. The class has arrived at its destination

Ranger Pete

Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete.

Class

Hi Ranger Pete.

Mackey

Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay.

Ranger Pete

Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.

Mackey

Oh that should be fun, m'kay. [looks at Billy, who looks back and punches his right palm with his left fist. His voice trembles] Ahhhh...

Ranger Pete

But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl. [Woodsy !Owl skips into view]

Mackey

Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!

Stan

Who's that?

Mackey

"Give a hoot, don't pollute," m'kay.

Woodsy Owl

Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,

Mackey

Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay. [claps] Oh, boy I love that song.

Ranger Pete

Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six.

Billy

We wanna be in Mackey's group!

Mackey

Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh.

Ranger Pete

That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.

Mackey

Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay? [Stan looks at the ranger, then hears gunfire, so he turns to see where it's from. The group of experts is seen chasing and shooting at Butterfly Randy]

DiCaprio

Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?

Expert 2

I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!

DiCaprio

Oh well. Just keep shooting!

Stan

What the fuck?

-----


The lab. All the patients moan and ahhh

An Expert

Mommy? Mommy?

-----


The observation room. Pinkerton, Dr. Chinstrap, and Sharon are now accompanied by several firefighters, and they all observe the patients

Fire Captain

[turns to Dr. Chinstrap] So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream?

Dr. Chinstrap

Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.

Fireman 1

But, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?

Pinkerton

It's very simple: You see, [Dr. Chinstrap provides accompaniment once again] when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream.

Fireman 1

Like a taco within a taco?

Fire Captain

A double-decker taco supreme.

Pinkerton

Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams.

Fire Captain

Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream? [Dr. Chinstrap continues his accompaniment, this time pulling a lamb by its tail and including its bleat]

Pinkerton

Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.

Pizza Man

Somebody order a pizza?

Pinkerton

No.

Dr. Chinstrap

Probably one of them in the dream.

Pizza Man

[determined] Alright, I'm goin' in. [goes into the lab. He goes to the first expert's couch, lays down next to him, and hooks himself up]

Pinkerton

Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious.

Dr. Chinstrap

And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN! [provides his own accompaniment]

-----


Frisco Woods, a pleasant scene. A butterfly sits on a leaf doing nothing when Randy descends on it and starts humping it. Soon, Mackey runs by and both butterflies fly away separately. Stan and Mr. Yelman chase Mackey

Mackey

Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!

Stan

Mr. Mackey, stop running!

Mackey

But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay! [stops briefly, then runs again] They're gonna kick it bad!

Stan

Look, dude! [catches up to Mackey and stops him] Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.

Mackey

I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay.

Billy

There he is! You can't run forever!

Mackey

Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god... [Mr. Yelman catches up]

Stan

Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.

Mr. Yelman

But I literally herd sheep.

Stan

Shut up!

Mackey

Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?

-----


The lab. The firemen have hooked themselves up and entered Mr. Mackey's dream.

Pizza Man

Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?

Pinkerton

Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.

Dr. Chinstrap

Alright, that does it. [goes to the coat hanger and grabs his coat] Get your coat.

Pinkerton

Where are we going?

Dr. Chinstrap

We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.

Pinkerton

You don't mean...

-----


Deep in the woods, day. A small cabin is seen in the distance as three helicopters fly towards it. A familiar bogeyman is shown splitting wood with an axe.

Dr. Chinstrap

Hello, Freddy. [the bogeyman turns around and it's Freddy Krueger, now with a full beard and mustache] You're looking healthy.

Freddy Krueger

Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?

Dr. Chinstrap

Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.

Freddy Krueger

Told you a long time ago: I gave that up. [resumes splitting wood]

Dr. Chinstrap

There's some good men stuck in there.

Freddy Krueger

[stops and turns around, exasperated] I said I'm done with it! [the cabin door and a woman with two kids appears in the doorway]

Woman

Everything all right, Fred?

Freddy Krueger

It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house. [Peg tugs at her kids and they all go back inside]

Dr. Chinstrap

Wife and kids.

Freddy Krueger

No thanks to you.

Dr. Chinstrap

We need ya Fred.

Freddy Krueger

Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!

Dr. Chinstrap

We had a country to protect!

Freddy Krueger

Protect it yourselves this time.

Dr. Chinstrap

Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!

Freddy Krueger

Then you should have no problem covering it up. [resumes splitting wood]

Dr. Chinstrap

[a few seconds later] Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this.

Freddy Krueger

[stops, sighs, and throws his axe away] Alright, fine.

-----


Frisco Woods, day. Mackey and Billy finally face off and Mackey is ready to fight

Mackey

Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!

Billy

You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! [Stan and Mr. Yelman look on]

Stan

You can do it Mr. Mackey.

Mackey

Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?

Billy

Alright Mackey. Take this. [rears his right arm back and is about to deliver a punch when a gunshot kills him. A second gunshot hits him for good measure. The five experts converge on Billy and his friends and shoot them thoroughly]

DiCaprio

Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!

Stan

What the hell?

Expert 2

We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.

Fire Captain

[through his bullhorn] Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic.

Stan

Who are you people?

DiCaprio

We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.

Stan

Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?

Expert 1

No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up.

Expert 2

Right. [nothing happens]

Stan

...So then why aren't we waking up?

Expert 2

Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.

Mackey

Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.

Expert 2

[strokes the back of his neck with his left hand] Oh, whoops.

Mackey

[begins to walk away] I remember. [walks to a small shack nearby] I ran and I ran and I hid in this building here. And somebody was in there. Somebody who talked to me real nice and then... and then touched me somewhere bad. [pushes the door open. Woodsy is molesting the actual boy Mackey]

Real Mackey

No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?

Mackey

Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no! [the woods begin to rumble and shake]

Fire Captain

What's happening?

Expert 2

Dream conundrum. This is bad. [Woodsy breaks through the front wall of the shack with glowing red eyes and roars]

Fire Captain

What the hell's going on?

DiCaprio

The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed! [Woodsy runs towards the group. The experts begin shooting at it and advance, but Woodsy remains unharmed] Our dream bullets don't hurt it. [Woodsy reaches for Mr. Yelman and decapitates him with a swipe of his left wing]

Mackey

No! No more, Woodsy. [hides his face]

Stan

Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!

Expert 1

He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo! [Woodsy roars again, and Freddy's blades rip through Woody's back and chest]

Freddy Krueger

There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy! [pulls his blades out and Woodsy falls down dead]

Mackey

It's dead... It's finally dead. [grins]

The observation room. Dr. Chinstrap reads the printouts this time

Dr. Chinstrap

Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.

Pinkerton

They're waking up. They're coming to. [enters the lab, and Dr. Chinstrap follows]

-----


The lab. Everyone is finally out of Mackey's dream

Dr. Chinstrap

Ahhh, you're back, everyone! [grins]

Randy

Aw, dammit. [Sharon is just happy Stan is back as they grin at each other]

Fire Captain

Thanks, Freddy.

Freddy Krueger

If only I could have saved the sheep herder.

Dr. Chinstrap

Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problems, Mr. Mackey?

Mr. Mackey

I sure did.

DiCaprio

Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl.

Mr. Mackey

I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?

Fire Captain

So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying "Give a hoot, don't pollute" and touching his penis with his wing?

Pinkerton

Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool!

Dr. Chinstrap

Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?

Stan

[thinks a moment] I think I have a better idea.

South Park Elementary, day. Stan is cleaning out his locker. Kyle and Wendy walk up to him

Wendy

Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?

Stan

Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.

Kyle

But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.

Stan

Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!

Kyle

How do you know... [this stops Stan cold] that wasn't your therapy? [Dr. Chinstrap walks up and begins his accompaniment...]
