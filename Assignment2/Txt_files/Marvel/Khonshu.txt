'''Khonshu''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Moon Knight]]'' #1 (Nov. 1980), created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], and is based on the Egyptian lunar god [[Khonsu]]. He is a member of the [[Heliopolitans|Heliopolitan]] pantheon and the patron of the superhero [[Moon Knight]].

[[Khonshu (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Khonshu]] appears in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[miniseries]] ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]'', performed by Karim El-Hakim and voiced by [[F. Murray Abraham]].<ref name="ProductionBrief" />

==Fictional character biography==
While Khonshu possessed Moon Knight during the hero's time with the [[West Coast Avengers]], Khonshu was often shown as a largely benevolent god who wanted to assist the team.{{issue|date=May 2022}} He was at times shown to be conflicted as to whether he should reveal his powers and what was worthy of it.{{issue|date=May 2022}} He was able to effortlessly resist being controlled by the mutant [[Voice (comics)|The Voice]].{{issue|date=May 2022}}

However, he is shown to become more and more of an antagonistic role to Moon Knight starting in the 2006 series,{{cn|date=May 2022}} where he would later become the main antagonist of the 2016 Moon Knight series,{{cn|date=May 2022}} and the age of Khonshu storyline in Jason Aaron's run.{{cn|date=May 2022}}

Moon Knight volume #4 initially treats Khonshu in a rather different way, portraying him as a harsh and unforgiving god of vengeance who is strengthened by the fear that his avatar inspires. Accordingly, he is quite prepared to manipulate Marc Spector's allies and enemies in order to revive Moon Knight's career, and is highly critical of Spector. As with many Moon Knight stories, the line between reality and hallucination is sometimes intentionally blurred, but aspects of the art and story do strongly suggest that Khonshu's actions are entirely real. Khonshu also appears as a statue, but primarily converses with Moon Knight in the mutilated form of the [[Bushman (comics)|Bushman]], a villain who was killed when Spector carved off his face. Khonshu calls this his 'greatest work.' Moon Knight eventually breaks the influence of Khonshu, seeing the god as a scale in line with a cockroach.{{issue|date=May 2022}}

'''Chons''', better known as Khonshu, was said to be the son of Atum (known to the Egyptian gods as Ammon Ra) and of Amaunet, air goddess of the Ogdoad pantheon.<ref name=":1">''Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica'' #1</ref> Another account stated that Khonshu was the adopted son of Amon Ra. He was the brother of Montu, and possibly Bes and Ptah, and was brother or half-brother to Bast and Sekhmet.<ref name=":1" /> According to Knull, Khonshu was actually an "elder shadow, dressed in local legend".<ref>''King in Black: Black Knight'' #1</ref>

Around the year 1,000,000 BC, Khonshu was offended by not having been offered membership of the Stone Age Avengers and chose a mortal avatar - the first known Moon Knight - to enforce his will on Earth and antagonize the Avengers on his behalf, eventually leading to the establishment of the Cult of Khonshu and a succession of Moon Knights.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 8 #35</ref> Khonshu and Ra have been warring against each other for millenia, having been reborn again and again through earthly avatars, with Khonshu beating Ra in every instance.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #190</ref>It was later revealed that Khonshu is the God of Time as well as Vengeance.<ref>''Moon Knight Annual'' Vol 2 #1</ref>

In [[Ancient Egypt]], Khonshu posed as a human pharaoh at the Egyptian city of Thebes, the seat of worship of Ammon Ra, at the same time Osiris posed as a mortal ruler in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis.<ref name=":1" /> [[Kang the Conqueror]] arrived in Ancient Egypt looking for the God of Time Seeking three artifacts joined together in a staff from Khonshu to gain dominion over time, Kang's plot is hampered when the staff is broken, scattering the three components he needs.{{issue|date=May 2022}}

Khonshu visited [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]], a young boy whose mind was broken and split into different personalities, and chose him as his [[avatar]].{{issue|date=May 2022}} Sadly his family sent him to Putnam Psychiatric Hospital for treatment. After his father's death, Marc was allowed to leave the hospital temporarily to attend the funeral and a late luncheon, but, after hearing Khonshu's voice, he ran away.{{issue|date=May 2022}}

In the modern day, Khonshu later resurrected Marc Spector and blessed him with superhuman powers and abilities under the Moon.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #1</ref>When Spector and Marlene travelled to Egypt, she was kidnapped by Jellim Yussaf, who hoped to find the treasure hidden in the Tomb of Seti II. Moon Knight tracked the down and during the fight he found the lost chamber, falling into the arms of a statue of Khonshu. The deity sent a gust of wind, allowing Moon Knight to glide down to knock out Yussaf.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #28</ref>Marc decided to retire as a vigilante and sold his statue of Khonshu which was bought by Anubis the Jackal, a former enemy of the Moon Deity. Khonshu visited Marc in his dreams hoping to bring him back as his champion on Earth. He later gave in and travelled to Egypt, where he met the Priests of Khonshu who provided him weapons and a suit designed by the time travelling Hawkeye thousands of years earlier. They informed him that his powers were affected by the phases of the moon and would be strongest at its fullest. Using his newfound powers he defeated Anubis and took back his statue which protected him when the temple collapsed.<ref>''Moon Knight Vol 2'' #1</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Khonshu has the conventional powers of the Ennead (the Heliopolitan gods), such as superhuman strength (Khonshu can lift (press) 60 tons), superhuman durability (possesses superhuman durability that allows him to withstand unspecified levels of injury), regenerative healing factor (despite his god-like durability, it is possible to injure Khonshu, but any damaged tissue heals much faster and better than even the healthiest human), immortality (he is extremely long-lived and is immune to disease and aging), magic manipulation (Khonshu can manipulate mystic energies for supernatural effects such as interdimensional teleportation, telepathy, healing the injured, resurrection, earthquakes and to grant superhuman powers to mortal beings such as the Moon Knight), lunakinesis (Khonshu was seemingly able to manipulate objects made out of moonrocks (including Uru)) and power absorption (Khonshu was able to steal the powers of various heroes and store them inside some Ankhs).<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 8 #33</ref>

==Other versions==
In the [[Universe X]] saga it is suggested that [[Uatu]] the Watcher who lives on the moon was the original inspiration for the Egyptian moon god Khonshu.{{issue|date=May 2022}}
