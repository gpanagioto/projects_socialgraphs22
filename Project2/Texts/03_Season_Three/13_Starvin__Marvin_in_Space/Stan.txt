What?? * I told you, fatass. Sshh! We don't know.   Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV. Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news. Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing. Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!  Wow! This is great! Yeah, that's better. Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world.  What the hell did you hit, Cartman?!  We're on like, some foreign planet. Uh, thanks. U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth. Cool! Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!  Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here. Uuh. Thanks. Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar. What?? Oh.  Run for it! He's not done for, he's standing right there. Alright, we made it! They're shooting at us. Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself. You dumbass, Cartman! You got 'em, Marvin. Sally Struthers is saving us! Now's our chance! We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.  Wow! Good job, dude! Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again. Maybe we'll come and visit sometime. Dude! I know, but you don't tell him that!
