All right.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice? Who are the corporations? Are you serious? We never heard that. Well... Well what do we do? ''Sign, sign everywhere. Sign''Done something to my mind. Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read. Right, so how do we get back at them?  NO! Yeah! So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations? You mean like a baker and a cop?  Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage! Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something? Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long? Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here. What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap?  Dad!
