 What's going on? Do it! Do it! Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly! Awww, go on and do it already!  Cartman, what did you do?! Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it! Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why! You don't have any powers! He can't do crap! Ha! You see?! What?! This is fuckin' ridiculous! What the hell is wrong with these people?! Hey! What about this guy?! Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!  I'm pretty sure he's your man. No. Why won't anybody listen to me?!  I ''am'' taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman. Be sure to take me to the same hospital! All right, here we go.  I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m. No, don't you see? Cartman never ''had'' psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.  There's a logical explanation for that.
