[approaching] Hey babe, how are you doin'? We still on for recess? 'K babe, love you.  Hey Stan? Can I talk to you about Eric? I just wanna make sure he's all right. I don't even know if I should be saying this, but, Eric said he was thinking about killing himself. We broke up, and he called saying he was about to do it. I'm still really scared for him. I'll send you the voice mail if you promise to keep it private. We're getting a lot of attention, Eric. Our Web site's already full of kids saying they feel the same way as you, and want to get help. For... wanting to take their own lives. But babe, there's a lot of kids who feel the same way you do. I thought this was about raising awareness and helping people. Eric, come on.  Eric, you need to stop. What they're doing is important. It's not about problem-solving, Eric. It's about people getting together and feeling what they need to feel. [Craig's jaw drops, as he realizes this is what Tweek was trying to tell him] People need help sorting out their emotions sometimes. And the best thing isn't always quick answers, but just being there, supporting each other and... talking through those feelings.  Come on, there has to be a way we can all work together here. Eric!
