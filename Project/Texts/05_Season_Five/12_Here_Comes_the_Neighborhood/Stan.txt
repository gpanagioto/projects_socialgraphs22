Your family ''is'' rich, dude. Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table. Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?   What's that? DVD? We don't own a DVD player. Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do.  I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play. I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman!  Oh hey, there's Token.  Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play? Sure, dude, you're our friend. Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you. Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew. Yeah, I get it for that. Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.  Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.
