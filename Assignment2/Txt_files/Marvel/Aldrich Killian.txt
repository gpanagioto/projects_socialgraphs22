Together they developed [[Extremis]], a [[Techno-Organic Virus]] that completely rewrites the body's genetic code, making entire organs more efficient and giving the body healing abilities in an attempt to create a new super soldier with super human strength, speed, endurance, reflexes and the ability to project electricity and breathe fire.

Over the years, through A.I.M. and with the aid of co-conspirator Maya Hansen's designs, Killian had A.I.M. further research and develop the Extremis formula, which imparts varying levels of strength and resiliency to human subjects. Some test subjects resulted in death via various explosion, but Killian recruited [[Coldblood|Eric Savin]] and [[Ellen Brandt]] to his cause. At some point, he also funded the [[Ten Rings (organization)|Ten Rings]] organization by masquerading as the '''[[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]]''' (without the [[Wenwu|true leader]]'s knowledge) and used British actor [[Trevor Slattery]] to maintain this illusion while Killian's Extremis experiments are seen as terrorist attacks. After kidnapping President [[Matthew Ellis]] with the intention of an execution on live television, Killian and his Extremis-soldiers are defeated and killed by Iron Man, [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], and [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]].
