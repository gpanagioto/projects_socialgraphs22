Hi, Stan. Yeahhh? I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look. I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca. Eww. Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating. Hi guys. Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi. Let's go trick-or-treats. Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad. But Stan! AAAAAAAAAAAH! Aaahahah! Aaahh. Aaah! Aaah! Oh, what happened? Stan? I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings. Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan. Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!
