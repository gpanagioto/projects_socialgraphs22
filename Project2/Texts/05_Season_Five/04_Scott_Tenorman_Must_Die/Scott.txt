And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them!  Speak of the devil! What do ''you'' want? Uh uh, I don't take returns! You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so! Buyer beware, dude! Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in!  You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face! Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money. How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty? Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty. Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars. Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back. And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes.  Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here! Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes! No reason. Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins. They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus! Hehere, take your money! Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo! Have you no heart?? You really went? What a 'tard. You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought Your grandma? Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that. Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money.  Here you go. But... just one thing before I give it to you: I just... well... I want you to beg for it. Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money. Do you want your grandma to live or not? No, no, get down on your knees. , and say "I beg you to give me back my money." Now say, "I'm a little piggy". Say it!  "Here's my snout." "Oink oink oink." Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me! You mean this?  Now you can't bug me for your dumb money!  Uh huh. Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.  Hello? What do you want? How do you know? Then why are you telling me? Oh. See ya.  Hey. Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great. Wow, a pony ride. Neat. Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want? What? How can I turn it down? Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.  Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do. Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now. I'm proud of you, too, Mom. What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods? Awesome!  The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town! Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything. Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first? Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.  Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh? Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it. Eh, it's a special recipe. I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you. What?! My... mom and dad are... dead?     Jesus!  Noooo!
