Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat? Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now! The prank is over! You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch. '''God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!''' Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk! Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here! Okay. I'm going to turn around now. Shit! Hello, children. How is your summer going? Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat. Mr. Hat is just a puppet. Mr. Hat isn't real. Hello? Is this some kind of joke? You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are! Goddammit..! And I can't sleep or think... Where would he have gone? Why would he leave? How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I? At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning. What?! Are you propositioning me? Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not ''gay!'' Mr. Hat, on the other hand... Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations. Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing. Well, I'm just sayin'. I think you're the loony one in this room. Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo. Wow, it's a black blizzard! Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig.
