I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before.   Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart. We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something? What's that? Shut up, Cartman? You shut up,  gaywad! No, we're friends. What? Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos. Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground. You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass. Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me." No! I'm gonna hit you if you ''don't'' say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you. All right.  Alright, we'll try this again, Pip. Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own.   Aw, man, if you have to. Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now.  Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff. Ah, dude, you don't say ''that''. Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling. Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going? Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid! But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole. Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny! Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole. Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!  Oh, brother!  You suck now, Kyle!  Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle! Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark.  Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark?   Nice speech, nerdo.
