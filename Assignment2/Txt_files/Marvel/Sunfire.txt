'''Sunfire''' ({{Nihongo|'''Shiro Yoshida'''|吉田 四郎|Yoshida Shirō}}) is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; superheroes (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Sunfire is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and sometime member of the [[X-Men]].

Sunfire is a Japanese [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who can generate superheated [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and fly. Not suited for teamwork due to his temperament and arrogance, Sunfire was briefly a member of the X-Men and has kept limited ties to the team since.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=160}}</ref>

==Concept and creation==
[[Roy Thomas]] recalled that, during his first run on ''[[X-Men]]'',<blockquote>I wanted to add a young Japanese or Japanese-American whose mother had been at [[Hiroshima]] or [[Nagasaki]] as a corresponding character to the X-Men, whose parents were, at that time, assumed to have been at the [[Manhattan Project]]. [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee, X-Men editor/co-creator]]] didn't give me any good reason [for rejecting the character]—he just didn't want to, I think... I didn't bring it up again, but when I came back to the book, with [[Neal Adams]], I created Sunfire, who is pretty much the character I had wanted to do some years earlier. I didn't make him an X-Man right away. By that time, Stan gave me a little more free {{Sic|re|ign}}. In fact, he was included in ''Giant Size X-Men'' #1, along with [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], precisely because I had gone around creating some 'international mutants,' with the goal of expanding the team at some time. I thought the X-Men shouldn't all be white Americans.<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first= Patrick Daniel | date = August 1993 | title = '60s Mutant Mania: The Original Team | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | pages = 76–77}}</ref></blockquote>

Thomas later commented on the character's costume "I had [[Don Heck]] design the character from my verbal suggestion of a costume that was an embodiment of the imperial Japanese [[Rising Sun Flag|Rising Sun flag]], as Japanese or Japanese-American.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://hero-envy.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-roy-thomas-marvel-comics-characters.html | title=The Roy Thomas Marvel Comics Characters, Concepts and Creations Part 2 }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Shiro Yoshida was born in Agarashima, [[Japan]]. His mother suffered [[radiation poisoning]] due to exposure to the [[atomic bomb]] dropped on [[Hiroshima]]; as a result, Shiro was born as a mutant possessing solar radiation powers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=144}}</ref>

Shiro's mother died of radiation poisoning when he was young. Shiro grew to hate the [[United States]], despite the influence of his father, an ambassador to the [[United Nations]] who was more tolerant of the US.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 62–63 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> Shiro's greedy uncle Tomo inspired him to become "Sunfire" and engage in a one-man battle against the U.S. As Sunfire, he attacked the [[United States Capitol]] and battled the X-Men, after which he witnessed Tomo murder his father; distraught, he killed Tomo and surrendered to the authorities.<ref>''X-Men'' #64</ref>

Sunfire becomes involved with the X-Men once again when [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] kidnaps him, as Sunfire is one of [[Apocalypse: The Twelve|the Twelve]], a group of unique mutants Apocalypse required to obtain reality-warping powers.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}  Sunfire then became a member of the Mumbai branch of [[X-Corporation]], a non-government organization devoted to the protection of mutant rights.<ref>''New X-Men'' #133 (2001). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the early story arcs of the latest edition of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', Sunfire attempts to combat the powerful villain known as [[Titannus]], a reject of the [[Super-Skrull]] program who had made his way to Earth after being brainwashed by an alien race to serve as their ultimate weapon. Attempting to contain Titannus, Sunfire summons practically the entire Japanese army to confront him, but the powerful foe defeats them army with ease, and is only barely beaten by a new team that had been hastily assembled by [[Doctor Strange]] to combat this threat.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

[[Image:Sunld.png|Sunfire is critically injured in his battle with Lady Deathstrike. Art by Karl Moline.|thumb|150px|left]]
Later, it was revealed that Sunfire had worked with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] back when Sunfire was still working with Tomo and Rogue was a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Also working with them was a girl called [[Blindspot (comics)|Blindspot]], who had the power to erase and restore memories. The four were on a mission to steal the process to bond [[adamantium]] from [[Lord Dark Wind]], the father of [[Lady Deathstrike]].

Since Blindspot always erased her tracks once a contract ended, she wipes the minds of everyone involved so no one would remember her.<ref name="auto1">''Rogue'' vol. 3 #10 (June 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>  Subsequently, Blindspot discovers Lord Dark Wind wanted all four dead for trying to steal his adamantium process. Realizing that the others would be in danger while having no memory of their mission, Blindspot went back to Japan to erase Lord Dark Wind's memory. When she got there, she discovered that his daughter (who later became Deathstrike) had already killed him. Blindspot erased Deathstrike's memories but, as Deathstrike was more machine than woman, Deathstrike was able to restore her own memories from an electronic backup. Deathstrike kidnapped Blindspot, who released a group photo of Sunfire, Rogue, and Mystique to attract their attention to save her. Rogue joined Sunfire, whose reputation had been ruined by the photograph, in [[Tokyo]] to discover why they were framed and who was responsible.<ref name="auto">''Rogue'' vol. 3 #11 (July 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>  The two ran into Lady Deathstrike who, in a heated battle, cut off Sunfire's legs, leaving him in critical condition. Rogue surrendered to Deathstrike, who imprisoned the two.{{issue|date=August 2016}} While imprisoned, Rogue met Blindspot, who restored Rogue's memories and explained what was going on.<ref name="auto1"/>

When Deathstrike discovers that the three were not responsible for stealing the adamantium, she attempted kill them to destroy any evidence of what she had done. A weak Sunfire asks Rogue to absorb his powers so she could properly battle Deathstrike. Rogue had previously lost the powers of [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]] that she had taken and was hesitant. She worries that she could harm Sunfire, but Blindspot pushes her on Sunfire's face, causing her to absorb all his powers and possibly killing him. With it, Rogue now also contains Sunfire's personality, similar to how she also once had Danvers' personality within her. With Sunfire's personality controlling her, Rogue seeks revenge on Deathstrike and severely injures the woman. The X-Men arrive in time to intervene, but Blindspot erases Rogue's memories of being an X-Man causing her to see her teammates as her enemies.<ref name="auto"/> After a brief altercation, Rogue's memories are restored and she tells the X-Men what had happened to Sunfire. They discover that his body is missing, leading some of the X-Men to believe he is somehow still alive.<ref>''Rogue'' vol. 3 #12 (August 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sunfire loses his powers before [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and his X-gene during that moment.{{Issue|date=April 2011}} It is revealed that Sunfire is rescued by a mysterious ninja group and taken to a hospital in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #182</ref> After being revived from his coma, the world's leading specialist in [[prosthetic limb]]s, Masanori Kuzuya, offers him his services. Before the reasoning behind the rescue is revealed, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] appears and offers Sunfire the chance for vengeance, as well as the recovery of his lost limbs and power, in return for his service as one of Apocalypse's new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]].{{Issue|date=April 2011}} Sunfire accepts, but after being chained away and locked in a prison while listening to the tortured screams of [[Gazer]] (another of the new Horsemen), Sunfire tries to escape. Unable to leave Gazer to his fate, Sunfire attempts to free him. However, Gazer's transformation to the Horseman 'War' had already been completed and he attacks. Captured again, Sunfire is transformed into the Horseman of Famine. When Apocalypse launches his attack on the X-Men, Sunfire causes an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. As he is fighting the X-Men, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] shoots him down and Rogue, who recognizes him, catches him as he falls. He is taken to the Medical Lab and [[Emma Frost]] enters his mind to help him. When Apocalypse departs, he sends War to retrieve Famine, but Shiro breaks free from Apocalypse's control and attacks War.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Sunfire is seen running off with the unconscious body of [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]], like him a former X-Men turned Horseman. At the temple where Sunfire first took Gambit, [[Mister Sinister]] tells them, "I am glad you both feel able to move on from the past... for I am your future!".{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Sunfire is shown as a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] still in the form of Famine.<ref>''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #200. Marvel Comics.</ref> Alongside Gambit, Sunfire attacks [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who destroys Providence. He subsequently attacks an escaping [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], but is taken down by Cannonball and is taken prisoner. Though Cannonball and Iceman consider interrogating Sunfire for information as to who he is working for, Cannonball decides against it, knowing that Sunfire would never confess. Instead, Iceman neutralizes Sunfire's artificial mutant abilities on a sub-atomic level using his own mutant abilities, while Cannonball fights him.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Sunfire is later held captive in the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] and is rescued by his fellow Marauders.{{Issue|date=April 2011}} After being rescued by the Marauders, Sunfire joins fellow members [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]], [[Prism (comics)|Prism]], [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]], [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], [[Lady Mastermind]], and [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] when they travel to Cooperstown, Alaska to find the Messiah [[Hope Summers (comics)|baby]] but instead come across the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] and they come to blows.<ref>''X-Men Messiah Complex'' (2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> He then participates in a battle alongside the Marauders and [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] against the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #205 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The next time Sunfire is seen, he is with Gambit, [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]], and Malice at Eagle Plaza, Texas, taking on [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] for the Messiah baby.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #494 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> He is involved in the battle at [[Muir Island]] over the mutant baby's fate.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #207 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> He is apparently knocked unconscious at some point, as it is revealed later that Bishop cauterized the wound of his severed arm by pressing it against Sunfire's unconscious but still flaming form.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} After Xavier was injured by Bishop, everyone went their separate ways, including the surviving members of the Marauders.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}

===Avengers===
Years later, Wolverine finds a drunken and disheveled Shiro in a Tokyo alleyway. Shiro is offered a spot on the new [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]], with Wolverine stating that Professor X always thought he had potential. He is initially hesitant, but agrees to join the Avengers after learning that the [[Red Skull]] has stolen Xavier's brain.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #5 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following a confrontation with the Celestial Exitar, who had come to judge Earth due to the machinations of the Apocalypse Twins, Sunfire was apparently killed by [[Kang the Conqueror]], but he was able to use his power to transform his body into a state of pure energy that he could use to absorb most of the Celestials' energy.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eight months after the events of "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]," Sunfire is back to his normal appearance. With the [[Terrigen Mist]] killing mutants across the globe, he takes a group of mutant survivors from Asia and attempts to get them to safety, only to end up trapped in [[Weirdworld]].<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #6</ref>

Sunfire later represented the Japanese government when he attended [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s meeting in the Eden Room of Avengers Mountain.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Family==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
Shiro Yoshida (Sunfire) is the brother of Leyu Yoshida, alias the superheroine [[Sunpyre]], who shares his flame-based powers. He is also the cousin of Wolverine's late fiancée [[Mariko Yashida]] and her half-brother the [[Silver Samurai]].

Yashida and Yoshida seem to be different spellings of the same name. While in his first appearance Sunfire was called Shiro Yoshida, he story arc that introduced his cousin, Mariko, his name was spelled Yashida and this version of the name was carried on in Mariko's next appearances.

==Powers and abilities==
Sunfire is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to absorb solar radiation, and convert it to ionize matter into a fiery [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state which bursts into flame when exposed to oxygen. Referring to his plasma output as "solar fire", he can release this energy through his hands as blasts of searing heat, deadly radiation, explosive concussive force, or simple flames. By ionizing the air around him, he can surround himself with an aura of heat intense enough to melt steel, or fly by focusing his aura downwards in a tight stream of ionized gas to propel him through the air like a rocket. Sunfire can see heat, by shifting his vision from visible light to [[infrared]].  Sunfire has the ability to form a psionic force field while using his plasma as protection from heat and radiation, both that of his own generation and that from outside sources. In a similar fashion to the [[Human Torch]]'s nova burst, Sunfire is capable of increasing his plasma output to temperatures around 1,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and emitting it as an omnidirectional blast.

Sunfire transferred his powers to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in order to defeat [[Lady Deathstrike]] who had just cut off his legs. This (like Ms. Marvel before him) left him still a mutant but powerless.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} After his transformation into Famine, a Horseman of Apocalypse, his powers and legs were returned, and he could now also use them to create flashes of light that affected the sections of the human brain which control hunger, causing any people who saw his light flashes to feel as if they were starving.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} Due to further genetic enhancement from Apocalypse, Sunfire is also able to secrete a specialized bio-oxygen from his skin, which allows him to breathe and conjure his flames even in the [[vacuum]] of space.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shiro also seems to be quite an accomplished martial artist. He has displayed impressive hand to hand skills on several occasions and stated that he didn't need to employ his powers in order to defeat [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas.{{issue|date=November 2010}} He is trained in karate, judo, and kendo (Japanese Samurai swordsmanship). He is also an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers. He has at least peak human physical ability.

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
In ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', Japan was destroyed by [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Shiro, a survivor of the massacre, was captured and given to [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] (the Horseman of Death), as a test subject for his experiments. Shiro's powers were pushed to their limits, causing his whole body to be set aflame, injuring him as a result. Shiro was rescued by the X-Men and joined them, taking on the codename Sunfire. Sunfire wore a containment suit to control his powers, although he was constantly on fire. Haunted by the destruction of his nation, Sunfire joined Rogue's task force of X-Men when they were sent to Chicago to fight Holocaust, who had begun a new series of Cullings. The character design of the original Sunfire as Famine (see above) is virtually identical to the Age of Apocalypse incarnation of the character.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #1-4 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the regular reality's X-Force crossed over into the Age of Apocalypse, Shiro was one of the few X-Men to return in order to prevent the destruction of Earth-616 by Archangel. Though he fought valiantly against the traitorous Iceman, seemingly killing him for his treachery, Shiro was killed while attempting to siphon energy from Holocaust's weapon of mass destruction, though he managed to buy X-Force precious moments with his sacrifice.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #18 (Feb 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Age of X-Man===
In the [[Age of X-Man]] reality, Shiro Yoshida is the Civil Management Instructor of the 10th Year class within the Summers Institute Of Higher Learning, located in Winchester, NY.<ref>''Age of X-Man - NextGen'' #1 (February 2019)</ref>

===''House of M''===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Sunfire became the Emperor of Japan. Under his rule, the country had prospered, though the poverty levels were extremely high among the baseline human population. In secret, Sunfire was one of the masterminds of Project: Genesis, a project sanctioned by the Japan branch of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with the goal of forcefully mutating baseline humans. When the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives-in-training dubbed the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] investigated a terrorist attack, they discovered the existence of Project: Genesis and its link to Emperor Sunfire. Sunfire lied to the Hellions and told them that Project: Genesis's purpose was to recycle organic waste into food for poor baseline humans.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', a zombie version of Sunfire and [[Silver Samurai]] can be briefly seen slaughtering civilians, while the [[Silver Surfer]] travels the globe, as a result of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] being infected and thus able to spread the zombie plague all over the world.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} The zombie version of Wolverine traveled to Earth-Z, where at Marvel Zombies Return, seeks an uninfected Sunfire that battles Zombie Wolverine, but was killed instead.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #94, Sunfire appears as a member of [[Alpha Flight]]. His power levels enhanced by Banshee, the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the Mutant Growth Hormone, he squares off against new X-Man recruit [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]].
