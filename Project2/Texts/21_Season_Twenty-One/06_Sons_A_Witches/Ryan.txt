Yeah, I got a real cape this year. Check it out.  You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches. Hey, what the hell is this? Right. You don't have to worry about us, going around snatching children. Only the other witch does that.  It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children. Everyone will be stoked on us now.
