Butters, shut the hell up!  Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot. Ye-heah! Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich." Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be ''so'' funny! It is not! Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week. Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a ''super funny'' turd sandwich? It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it. A turd sandwich. Turd sandwich. Turd sandwich. Awwwww! Okay. You win, Kyle. All right turd sandwich! Giant Douche sucks! Game on, Jew-boy! Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow! We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot. Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy? Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school? You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd ''and'' the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives. So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes? Well then, perhaps we could interest you in   Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings. Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move. Oh, no! Noooo!!
