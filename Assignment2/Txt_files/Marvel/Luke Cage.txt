'''Lucas''' "'''Luke'''" '''Cage''', born '''Carl Lucas''' and also known as '''Power Man''', is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #1 (June 1972) and was created by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[George Tuska]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[John Romita Sr.]]<ref>[https://www.comics.org/issue/25193/ ''Hero for Hire'' #1 (June 1972)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].

Created during the height of the [[blaxploitation]] genre, Luke Cage had been imprisoned for a crime he did not commit and gained the powers of superhuman strength and [[Invulnerability|unbreakable skin]] after being subjected voluntarily to an experimental procedure. Once freed, he becomes a "[[Heroes for Hire|hero for hire]]" and has forty-nine issues of solo adventures (comic title renamed to ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' with issue #17). In issue #50, Cage teams up with fellow superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] as part of a crime-fighting duo in the renamed title, ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]''. He later marries the super-powered private investigator [[Jessica Jones]], with whom he has a [[Danielle Cage|daughter]]. In 2005, writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] added Luke Cage to the lineup of [[The New Avengers (comics)|the New Avengers]], and he has since appeared in various ''Avengers'' titles, becoming leader of a group of reformed [[supervillain]]s called the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), [[Mike Colter]] portrayed [[Luke Cage (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the character]] in the [[Netflix]] [[Netflix's Marvel television series|television series]] ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' (2015–2019), ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'' (2016–2018), and ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' (2017).

==Development==
Roy Thomas publicly discussed the characters creation, "In 1971, when the success of the movie [[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]] had reached an interracial audience, [[Stan Lee]] decided it was time to go beyond [[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]] and Captain America's partner the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] as a support character.  I think he briefly toyed with the notion of a Falcon comic book, but probably felt the Falcon was better off where he was, and that he was perhaps not as strong a character as was needed.  When he mentioned that he wanted to work up a new African-American super-hero who would be a bit different and would start right out in his own comic, he asked me for my suggestions as to the writer.  I didn't feel I should do the character myself, so I suggested [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], although [[Gerry Conway]], [[Len Wein]], and others must've crossed my (and Stan's) mind.  Archie, Stan, and I--with [[John Romita Sr.|John Romita]] perhaps present, spent a half hour or so in deliberations within the next day or so, and each of us contributed something to the mix.  Stan's was definitely the guiding hand, because he knew he wanted a super-hero who was off the beaten track, off to make a living at crime-fighting (a la a private eye), and with a different look or feel than a typical super-hero, even a Marvel one.  Romita helped provide that, of course, with the outfit that was perfectly suited to the 1970s, including the chains.  Stan was looking for a name for the character, and I suggested Cage, which later I realized I'd seen some time before on a list of potential character names Gil Kane had shown me and had consciously forgotten about. Archie would add the "Luke" when he did the script later.  Stan wanted an untypical name for the mag, too... not a usual super-hero name, but something indicating what he was.  I'd recently written an [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] issue titled "Heroes for Hire," so I suggested HERO FOR HIRE as the title.  As for powers, I suggested he be very strong and bulletproof, though bullets could cause him some discomfort by raising temporary welts on his skin, etc.... [[Philip Wylie]]'s [[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]] was my main inspiration here, though Stan and I agreed that we didn't want him to have [[Hugo Danner]]'s leaping abilities (which had been borrowed by [[Superman]] years before).  Archie, I believe, came up with the precise escaped-innocent-prisoner concept, though Stan probably contributed to that as well.  And out of that committee of three (four, counting John's concept sketch) was Luke Cage, Hero for Hire born."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cimino |first=John |url=http://hero-envy.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-roy-thomas-marvel-comics-characters.html |title="Hero Envy" The Blog Adventures: THE ROY THOMAS MARVEL COMICS CHARACTERS, CONCEPTS AND CREATIONS PART 2 |publisher=Hero-envy.blogspot.com |date=2020-01-01 |accessdate=2022-08-28}}</ref>

Romita commented on the design of the character stating "We did it together. The chains were because we wanted the slavery angle. His costume was supposed to say super-hero, yet not super-hero. It was whatever he salvaged when he escaped from prison. He had the yellow shirt and headband and wristbands to contrast with his black skin."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Romita |first1=John |title=John Romita --and all that jazz! |date=2007 |publisher=TwoMorrows Pub |location=Raleigh, N.C. |isbn=978-1-893905-75-7 |pages=54-55}}</ref>

Luke Cage was created following conversations between [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[Roy Thomas]] shortly after [[blaxploitation]] films emerged as a popular new genre.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal |last= Callahan |first= Timothy |date= December 2010 |title= Power Man and Iron Fist |journal= [[Back Issue!]] |issue= 45 |pages= 3–11 |publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> He debuted in his own series, with the cover trademark ''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' and the title ''Hero for Hire.''<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/2051/ ''Hero for Hire'' (Marvel, 1972 series)] at the Grand Comics Database.

Retrieved on February 14, 2018.</ref> Cage's adventures were set in a grungier, more crime-dominated [[New York City]] than that inhabited by other Marvel superheroes of the time.<ref name="back45"/>

As blaxploitation's popularity faded, Cage was paired with the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], whose popularity was based on the declining [[martial arts]] film genre, in an effort to save both characters from cancellation.<ref name="back45"/> The series' title remained ''Power Man'', though with issue #50 (April 1978) the trademarked cover title became ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'', retained through the series' cancellation with issue #125 (September 1986). The series' final writer, [[James Owsley]] (a.k.a. Christopher Priest), attempted to shed Cage's blaxploitation roots by giving him a larger vocabulary and reducing usage of his [[catchphrase]], "Sweet Christmas!"<ref name="back45"/>

In 1992, Cage was relaunched in a new series simply titled ''Cage'', set primarily in Chicago. The revived series updated the character, with Cage symbolically destroying his original costume on the cover of the first issue. The series, written by [[Marcus McLaurin|Marc McLaurin]], ran 20 issues. Cage received exposure in other books at the time, including his own serial in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''. In the aftermath of the "[[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]]" and "[[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]" companywide storylines, Cage was included in the series ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'', written by [[John Ostrander]], which lasted 19 issues. In 2002, writer [[Brian Azzarello]] and artist [[Richard Corben]] collaborated on ''Cage'', a standalone mini-series set outside the mainstream Marvel canon. The mini-series was published under the [[Marvel MAX]] imprint, which allowed for a much greater degree of violence, sexual content and profanity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/09/brian-michael-bendis-luke-cage.html|title=How Luke Cage Went From Cutting Edge to Caricature, and Then Back Again|website=Vulture}}</ref>

Subsequently, Cage was featured in the [[Brian Michael Bendis]]-written series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'', ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]''.

In 2010, Cage became a regular character in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', starting with issue #144,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Arrant |first1=Chris |title=Luke Cage Powers Into Thunderbolts as Heroic Age Leader |url= http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Thunderbolts-Luke-Cage-100209.html |website=Newsarama |access-date=29 July 2014 |date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> and continued as leader of the team when the title transitioned into ''Dark Avengers'' beginning with issue #175. Cage also reappeared as a regular character in the second volume of ''The New Avengers'' series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Luke Cage Is a New Avenger Again |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25026 |website=Comic Book Resources |access-date=29 July 2014 |date=March 1, 2010}}</ref>

In 2007, it was announced that cartoonist and ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' creator [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] would write and illustrate a four-issue limited series called ''Cage!'', which would take place in a retro 1970s setting outside of the established continuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicsalliance.com/genndy-tartakovsky-luke-cage-comic-interview/|title=Genndy Tartakovsky on The Status of His Luke Cage Comic|first=Eric|last=Larnick|website=ComicsAlliance}}</ref> The project was heavily delayed, but finally saw publication in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/26447-genndy-tartakovsky-talks-luke-cage-hotel-transylvania-2-and-more.html|title=Tartakovsky On Returning to Luke Cage, Directing for Marvel, and Hotel Transylvania 2|website=Newsarama}}</ref>

In 2016, a new volume of ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' was launched, written by David F. Walker. The series ran for 15 issues before transitioning into a new ''Luke Cage'' series (also written by Walker), which ran for another 10 issues.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Born Carl Lucas and raised in [[New York City]]'s [[Harlem]] neighborhood, he spends his youth in a gang called the Rivals. With his friend [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker]], he fights rival gangs and commits petty crimes. In and out of juvenile homes throughout his teens, Lucas dreams of becoming a major New York racketeer until he finally realizes how his actions are hurting his family. He seeks to better himself as an adult by finding legitimate employment. Meanwhile, Stryker rises through the ranks of crime, but the two men remain friends. When Stryker's activities anger the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime syndicate, he is badly beaten in a mob hit, saved only by Lucas's intervention. When Stryker's girlfriend, [[Reva Connors]], breaks up with him in fear of his violent work, she seeks solace with Lucas. Stryker is convinced that Lucas is responsible for the breakup, so he plants heroin in Lucas's apartment and tips off the police. Lucas is arrested and sent to prison where contact with his family is sparse due to the resentment of his brother James Lucas Jr., who intercepts Lucas's letters to their father [[James Lucas (comics)|James]] and eventually leads each to believe the other is dead.<ref>''Cage'' #8-10. Marvel Comics.</ref> During this time, Reva is killed by members of the Maggia, whose drugs Stryker had stolen to frame Lucas in the first place.<ref name=autogenerated8>''Hero For Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Lucas is consumed by rage over Stryker's betrayal and his father's supposed death, engaging in frequent brawls and escape attempts. Eventually transferred to Seagate Prison off the coast of Georgia, he becomes the favorite target of racist corrections officer Albert "Billy Bob" Rackham, whose sadistic brutality ultimately leads to a demotion that he blames on Lucas. Research scientist Dr. [[Noah Burstein]] recruits Lucas as a volunteer for a [[Regeneration (biology)|cellular regeneration]] experiment based on a variant of the Super-Soldier process he had previously used to empower [[List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members#Warhawk|Warhawk]]. This experiment would later be revealed to be part of the [[Weapon Plus]] program, specifically, Weapon VI.<ref>''Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Burstein immerses Lucas in an electrical field conducted by an organic chemical compound; then he leaves Lucas unattended, Rackham alters the experiment's controls, hoping to maim or kill Lucas. Lucas' treatment is accelerated past its intended limits, inducing body-wide enhancements that give him superhuman strength and durability. He uses his new power to escape Seagate and makes his way back to New York, where a chance encounter with criminals inspires him to use his new powers for profit.<ref name=autogenerated8/>

Adopting the alias Luke Cage and donning a distinctive costume, he launches a career as a Hero for Hire, helping anyone who can meet his price. He soon establishes an office above [[Times Square]]'s Gem Theater, where he befriends film student [[David Griffith (comics)|D. W. Griffith]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 74–75 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> Burstein, aware of his friend's innocence, also relocates to New York and opens a medical clinic, assisted by Dr. [[Claire Temple]], whom Cage begins dating. Although Cage is content to battle strictly conventional criminals, he soon learns that New York is hardly the place to do so. Stryker himself has become a Maggia agent known as Diamondback and dies battling Cage.<ref name=autogenerated8/><ref>''Hero for Hire'' #2. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Superhero ties===
Although Cage has little in common with most of New York's other superhumans, an ill-conceived attempt to collect a fee from a reneging [[Doctor Doom]] leads him to befriend the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #9 (1973). Marvel Comics.</ref> Via a later retcon, Cage also befriends [[Jessica Jones]], a young woman whose superhuman strength and unconventional style match his own.<ref name=Pulse14>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Pulse'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a mission in which Cage and [[Iron Man]] track down Orville Smythe, who had duped him into stealing an experimental starsuit from [[Stark Enterprises#Stark International|Stark International]], Cage follows the example of his new peers and takes the codename of Power Man.<ref>''Power Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cage battles a rogue [[Erik Josten]] for the use of the Power Man name, winning the right.<ref>''Power Man'' #21. Marvel Comics</ref>

Shortly afterward, Luke Cage begins associating with the loose-knit super-team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], alongside whom he battles the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]<ref>''The Defenders'' #17–19. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Sons of the Serpent]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #24–25. Marvel Comics.</ref> Called to assist the Defenders against the [[Plantman]], Cage begins to complain that his participation in their group is interfering with his paying work. Wealthy Defenders member [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] solves this problem by placing Power Man on retainer, giving Luke a steady paycheck for his Defenders activities. For some time thereafter, Power Man serves as a core member of the Defenders. Together, they defeat minor threats including the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] and the [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], and major menaces such as the [[Headmen]], [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]], Egghead's [[Emissaries of Evil]], and the Red Rajah; but Cage feels out of place in the often-bizarre exploits of the Defenders and eventually resigns.<ref>''The Defenders'' #36–46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Power Man and Iron Fist===
{{Main|Power Man and Iron Fist}}

Having obtained proof of Cage's innocence in his original drug charges, the criminal [[Bushmaster (John McIver)|Bushmaster]] abducts Burstein and Temple, using their safety and the hope of acquittal to blackmail Cage into abducting detective [[Misty Knight]], who humiliated Bushmaster in an earlier encounter. Cage's efforts lead to a fight with Knight's boyfriend, the martial artist [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], who had spent most of his life in the extra-dimensional city of [[K'un-L'un]] and was unfamiliar with Earth society. Upon learning of Cage's situation, Iron Fist and Knight help him defeat Bushmaster and rescue his friends.<ref>''Power Man'' #48–49. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cleared of criminal charges, Power Man legally changes his name to "Lucas Cage".<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> He briefly works for Misty Knight and [[Colleen Wing]]'s detective agency, Nightwing Restorations, but soon elects to join Iron Fist in a two-man team, [[Heroes for Hire]],<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #54. Marvel Comics.</ref> founded by attorney [[Jeryn Hogarth]] and staffed by administrative wunderkind [[List of Marvel Comics characters: W#White Jennie|Jennie Royce]]. Although the streetwise Power Man and the unworldly Iron Fist seem to have little in common, they soon become the best of friends. Cage's relationship with Claire Temple proves less durable, and he instead begins dating model Harmony Young.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #51. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Power Man and Iron Fist achieve great success with Heroes for Hire, earning an international reputation and fighting a wide variety of criminals. Their partnership's downfall begins when the mysterious government agency S.M.I.L.E. manipulates Power Man and Iron Fist into the employment of Consolidated Conglomerates, Inc., which eventually frames Cage for the apparent murder of Iron Fist, causing Cage to become a fugitive.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Chicago===
A fugitive again, Cage breaks contact with his New York friends and relocates to Chicago,<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #82. Marvel Comics.</ref> but, with Hogarth's help, he is cleared of criminal charges when Iron Fist turns up alive. Cage discovers that Iron Fist had been replaced by a doppelganger of the plantlike [[H'ylthri]] race, K'un-Lun's ancient enemies during his treatment. This doppelganger's existence and destruction at the hands of the Super-Skrull are part of a bizarre scheme engineered by Iron Fist's enemy, [[Master Khan]].<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #15-25</ref>

Wanting a new start after his murder charge is dropped, Cage abandons his Power Man guise and begins operating out of Chicago as the plainclothes Luke Cage, Hero for Hire; he makes arrangements with the ''Chicago Spectator'' for exclusive reports of his adventures and frequently works with detective [[Dakota North (comics)|Dakota North]]. On his first mission in Chicago, he assists the [[Punisher]] in battling drug dealers.<ref>''Punisher'' #60–62. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cage attracts the interest of the refined assassin Hardcore, an employee of Cruz Bushmaster, son of the villain whose defeat cleared Cage's name the first time.<ref>''Cage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Cage learns that Cruz, following in his father's extortion footsteps, has abducted Noah Burstein's wife Emma to force the scientist to recreate the process that had empowered Cage. Cruz undergoes the procedure himself, but the elder Bushmaster drains the power from his son, reversing his near-catatonia and declaring himself the Power Master. Cage teams with Iron Fist to thwart their plans, freeing the Bursteins while the Bushmasters apparently perish. Cage's power is augmented further by exposure to the Power Man virus.<ref>''Cage'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While Cage tries to locate his surviving family members with the aid of Dakota North, his brother keeps moving his father around to keep Cage away from them. James Lucas Jr., is eventually recruited by the criminal [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]], whose power-enhancing scientist Dr. [[Karl Malus]] mutates him into the superhuman [[Coldfire (comics)|Coldfire]]. As Coldfire, James Jr. hopes to be a match for his brother, whom he regards as a threat. Though James, Jr. works with the Corporation quite willingly, Malus has James Sr. held hostage as extra insurance of Coldfire's cooperation. When Cage learns the Corporation is holding his family, he invades their headquarters and battles Coldfire. The brothers ultimately join forces to rescue their father from Malus, and Coldfire sacrifices himself to destroy the Corporation's headquarters.<ref>''Cage'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Heroes for Hire'' return===
A few months later, Cage investigates the murder of Harmony Young and fights her killer, the demon Darklove, alongside [[Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #131–136 (June–September 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> The mystic [[Doctor Druid]] recruits Cage to serve in his [[Defenders (comics)#Secret Defenders|Secret Defenders]] against the sorcerer Malachi. Cage returns to New York and, deciding his heart is no longer in superheroics, becomes co-owner of the Gem Theater with his friend D.W. Griffith. Even an invitation from Iron Fist to join a new and expanded Heroes for Hire fails to interest him; yet when the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]] tries to recruit Cage as a spy within Iron Fist's team, destroying Cage's theater in the process, a curious Cage plays along. Cage joins Heroes for Hire and serves with them for some time while reporting to the Master. Cage begins to sympathize with the more benevolent aspects of the Master's goals, but in the end, Cage can neither betray Iron Fist nor reconcile himself to the tremendous loss of life the Master's plans of conquest will entail, and he helps Heroes for Hire destroy the Master of the World's plans. Cage remains with the group thereafter, and dates a fellow member, the [[She-Hulk]]. When the Stark-Fujikawa Corporation buys out Heroes for Hire, Cage and [[Ant-Man]] are fired because of their prison records, and the rest of the team quits in protest.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Cage, bitten by the hero bug once more, continues to share adventures with Iron Fist and other heroes. Briefly resuming his Power Man identity, he is hired by Moon Knight to join an unnamed team of street-level New York vigilantes, but mere days after he joins, the group dissolves following clashes with the forces of [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Zheng Zu|Fu Manchu]]. Deciding that a return to basics is in order, he re-establishes his Hero for Hire activities and soon learns that, despite his international fame, he is almost forgotten on the streets where he originally made his reputation. He invests his money in a bar and sets about ridding his immediate neighborhood of criminal elements, deciding that the business of world-saving is best left to others.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Jessica Jones and the New Avengers===
After a sexual encounter with a drunken [[Jessica Jones]], now a private investigator, Cage's life is briefly thrown into disarray by Jones's reaction to the incident.<ref>''Alias'' #1–2.

When the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] is enacted, Cage refuses to register, comparing the act to [[Jim Crow laws]]. He and Jessica agree that she will take their newborn daughter away to [[Canada]] where they can be safe, though he himself refuses to leave. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces come to arrest Cage, but he fights his way to safety with the help of [[Captain America]], the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] (posing as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]), and joins Captain America's "Secret Avengers".<ref>''The New Avengers'' #22.

==Powers and abilities==
Luke Cage possesses superhuman strength and stamina, and has extremely dense skin and muscle tissue which render him highly resistant to physical injury. Cage possesses these abilities as a result of a [[Regeneration (biology)|cellular regeneration]] experiment which fortified the various tissues of his body. His skin can resist large-caliber bullets, puncture wounds, corrosives, biological attacks, and extreme temperatures and pressures without sustaining damage.<ref name="New Avengers #7">New Avengers #7</ref> A second exposure to said experiments further enhanced his strength and durability.<ref name="Cage #5-8">''Cage'' #5–8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The same experiment which granted him his great strength and durability has also given him a faster-than-normal recovery time from injury.<ref>''Civil War:'' Battle Damage Report (March 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Luke Cage is an exceptional street fighter and was a gifted athlete before receiving superhuman abilities. He has also studied martial arts under [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'s instruction, learning how to couple leverage with his strength in order to increase his combat effectiveness against more powerful opponents.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Reception==
In a 2008 poll, Luke Cage was ranked as the 34th-greatest comic book character of all time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 |title=Wizard's top 200 characters.

In her analysis of the comics, Sharon Packer, M.D., made connections between Cage's origin story and historical events taking place in the time of the comics' publication. Carl Lucas uses his newfound power to crash through the prison's cement barricades, he symbolically breaks through barriers that were once closed to him, similar to other black people of his era. Luke Cage's story has a distinct connection to unethical medical experiments; his comics presumably enhanced awareness of the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]]s that made ''[[New York Times]]'' headlines in the very same month and year that Luke Cage debuted. Dr. Altman published a book on self-experimentation ethics, one of many texts discussing ethical breaches in medical experiments at that time, meaning that the Luke Cage stories likely picked up on the rhetoric on prison experiments during that time and tapped into opprobrium about ethics. Since his comics were released at the same time that the news broke about the Tuskegee syphilis experiments on black men in Alabama, an event which caused public outrage and swayed public opinion against non-consenting or coercive human experimentation, it can be inferred that Luke Cage's story influenced some of the aforementioned public opinion.<ref name=ethics>{{cite web|url=http://www.priory.com/history_of_medicine/ethics_Luke_Cage.htm|title=ethics_Luke_Cage|website=www.priory.com|access-date=3 July 2017}}</ref>
