Dude, I don't understand this game at all. Um, deny it? Sweet. Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS. You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight! Oh, man, that's terrible. Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.  Blaaa-lalalalalalala.  We're making faces at sick people. We don't know. You're ''not'' more mature than us, Cartman! Yeah. Now what are you going to do?  We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway! Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature. We got invited too, fatass! This is boring.  That seems kind of... weird. Yeah. Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us! Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide!  Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody ''out''. Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you. And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
