'''Coal Tiger''' ('''Prince T'Chaka II''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''The Avengers'' #355. He also appeared in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] series ''[[A-Next]]''. He is the son of T'Challa, King of Wakanda and the superhero known as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

==Fictional character biography==
T'Chaka II is the son of [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and is named after his grandfather [[T'Chaka]]. When a racist team of villains called [[Soldiers of the Serpent]] attacked T'Challa's friend N'Kano (who was on a diplomatic mission for [[Wakanda (Marvel Comics)|Wakanda]] in New York), [[A-Next]] tried to save him. As the Serpents battled with the heroes of A-Next, T'Challa's son T'Chaka II charged into battle. While [[A-Next#Mainframe|Mainframe]] tried to convince the youth to leave the battle, T'Chaka II [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a feral black [[werecat]] called the "Coal Tiger". Coal Tiger's bestial abilities were able to turn the tide in A-Next's favor. He was offered membership with the team after the battle was won, but he declined stating that he would be available to help if they needed him.<ref name=autogenerated1>''A-Next'' #4.

When all of the members of A-Next were captured by an evil version of A-Next called the [[Revengers]], Coal Tiger was one of the many heroes who came to free the captured superheroes. When A-Next was freed and the Revengers were defeated, Coal Tiger finally agreed to join the team.<ref name=autogenerated1/>
