 No! No!  Damn it no! No! Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me!  They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America!  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?  There you are, Butters! Butters, I need your help. The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care! I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now. You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents! Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?  So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!  You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese. All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready? This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country! Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull. Fruttar sheshar.  Do you see them? Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out. They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Oh, herro, prease, herro. So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves. Ting ton teetong. Yeah,  All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?! Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran. What day is American invasion again? I fohget.   ...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull. Oh my God... Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Hold the gun on them Butters! They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me! Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese! Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive! Shoot him, Butters! You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it! Aw dude, you shot him in the dick. That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.  It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just ''weak''. I can't believe you, Butters. Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!   Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  Don't come any closer! We have information that we will only trust with the President of the United States! No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters!  Dude! What the fuck are you doing?! God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?! What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick! ...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it! No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?! Good! Did you kill him?  Dude... Dude!   You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man. I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front. I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.
