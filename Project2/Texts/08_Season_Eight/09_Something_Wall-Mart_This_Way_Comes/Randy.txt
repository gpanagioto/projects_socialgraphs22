 Look at it, honey. It's so big. It's beautiful! Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters.  It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.   I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick. Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  Staaaan?  Staan... No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night. Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park. Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled. Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy ''six'' steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart. I know, I know! God!  Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart! Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart! STAN! ''One'' family buying ''one'' glass isn't gonna make a difference! Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?! I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here. Oh all right, maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips. And butter.  And some new pliers. Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all! Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.  Can I help you?  You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better. I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend. Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine. Shhhhh! What are you talking about? Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God! Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us! Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains!  The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight! I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me! This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff! Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us. You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand? All right, let's not make that mistake again.
