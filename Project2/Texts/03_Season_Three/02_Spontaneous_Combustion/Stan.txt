 Is this what you're looking for, Kyle? Why is ''that'' funny? That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! He just... ignited. Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on. Wow, that was short.  The what? I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible. Dad, where's our Bible? Or else what? ...What?  Where's our Bible? Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death? ...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection.  Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets. Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight. Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate. Station Two: Jesus takes his cross. And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him.  Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross.   Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks." And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrection three days later. This spot looks good.  Okay, cool. See you, Cartman. Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess. Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection. Whoa, dude, my dad's famous. Wow, he died. Cartman?? Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus. Sick, dude! Okay, okay, just go away!  Uh. We've been taking care of him. Apples? Dude! I don't think I like this new law. Yeah. Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to ''my'' dad! Dude, he's still not dead. That's not your mom calling! He is right. It ''has'' been getting really hot lately. Hey, yeah!  Dad, where's the phone book? Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect? Oh. Uh, it... sucks ass. Oh my God, what's going on? Dude, that's my dad! I know, huh? He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do. What are you doing, dad? No, he's not. He can't even get an erection. Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution! Well, ''that'' doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross. See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few." It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime.  Huh? Uh, well, Bible, ''Wrath of Khan'', what's the difference? Dad. Dad!  Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!  See? My dad ''is'' the coolest after all. Cartman! He's been up there for like, three weeks. That's amazing! Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
