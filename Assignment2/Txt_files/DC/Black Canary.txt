One of DC's earliest superheroines, the title Black Canary has appeared in many of the company's flagship [[team-up]] titles, including ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' and ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]''. Since the late 1960s, the character has been paired with archer superhero the [[Green Arrow]], both professionally and romantically. As well as featuring in many Green Arrow stories, she is closely associated with the [[Batman family]] of characters, and specifically [[Barbara Gordon]], her best friend, with whom she leads the superhero team [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].

The Black Canary has been adapted into [[Black Canary in other media|various media]]. In ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series she was played by [[Rachel Skarsten]] and [[Lori Loughlin]], and in ''[[Smallville]]'' she was played by [[Alaina Huffman]].

==Publication history==
Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino created the character in 1947 to be featured in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' as a supporting character. Appearing first as a clandestine crime-fighter who infiltrates criminal organizations to break them from the inside, the Black Canary was drawn with [[fishnet]] [[Hosiery|stockings]] and a black leather jacket to connote images of a sexualized yet strong female character.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Madrid|first1= Mike|title= The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines|publisher= [[Tod Davies|Exterminating Angel Press]]|year= 2009|pages= 27–28|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ITJvdZ0VB5QC&q=black+canary+fishnets&pg=PA27|isbn= 978-1935259039}}</ref> She appeared as a character in a back-up story featuring "[[Johnny Thunder]]":

{{blockquote|I was drawing Johnny Thunder, which was not much of a character. I suppose he could have been better because his 'Thunderbolt' was interesting, but the situations they were in were pretty juvenile. Bob Kanigher wrote those stories, and he had no respect for the characters. These stories were nowhere near as good as 'The Flash' stories. DC knew it—they knew 'Johnny Thunder' was a loser, so Kanigher and I brought the ''Black Canary'' into the series. Immediately she got a good response, and it was, 'Bye, bye, Johnny Thunder.' Nobody missed him.<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010">{{cite book|last1= Amash|first1= Jim|last2= Nolen-Weathington|first2= Eric|title= Carmine Infantino: Penciler, Publisher, Provocateur|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2010|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|pages= 30–32|isbn= 978-1605490250}}</ref>|Carmine Infantino}}

According to Amash and Nolen-Weathington (2010), Black Canary is "really" Carmine Infantino's "first character".<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010"/> According to the artist:<blockquote>When Kanigher gave me the script, I said, 'How do you want me to draw her?' He said, 'What's your fantasy of a good-looking girl? That's what I want.' Isn't that a great line? So that's what I did. I made her strong in character and sexy in form. The funny part is that years later, while in Korea on a National Cartoonists trip, I met a dancer who was the exact image of the Black Canary. And I went out with her for three years.<p>Bob didn't ask me for a character sketch [for the Black Canary]. He had a lot of respect for me, I must say that. He always trusted my work... Bob loved my Black Canary design.<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010"/></blockquote>

==={{anchor|Pre-Crisis}}Dinah Drake===
{{Main|Black Canary (Dinah Drake)}}
At her [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] debut, the Black Canary was the [[alter ego]] of Dinah Drake and participated in crime-fighting adventures with her love interest (and eventual husband), [[Gotham City]] detective [[Larry Lance]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=The Black Canary |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/bcanary.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Initially, the character was a hand-to-hand fighter without superpowers who often posed as a criminal to infiltrate criminal gangs. Later stories depicted her as a world-class martial artist with a superpower: the "canary cry", a high-powered [[Sonic weapon|sonic scream]] which could shatter objects and incapacitate and even kill powerful foes. When DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|adjusted its continuity]], the Black Canary was established as two separate entities: mother and daughter, Dinah Drake-Lance and Dinah Laurel Lance. Stories since the Silver Age focused on the younger Black Canary, ascribing her superhuman abilities to a [[Metahuman|genetic mutation]].

==={{anchor|Post-Crisis}}Dinah Laurel Lance===
{{Main|Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance)}}
Following the universe-altering events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (concluding in March 1986), the Black Canary's history was revised again. The mind-transplant story of 1983 was discarded; in this version of the story, the present-day Black Canary is Dinah Laurel Lance, who inherits the identity from her mother, Dinah Drake-Lance. Although some references (for example, those in [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson's]] ''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'' series) tried to distinguish between the two Canaries by calling the first "Diana", recent accounts have confirmed Dinah as the mother's given name.

The two Canaries' origin stories were told in full in ''Secret Origins'' (vol. 2) #50 (August 1990). In this story, Dinah Drake is trained by her father, detective Richard Drake, intending to follow him on the Gotham City police force. When she is turned down, her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards. Determined to honor his memory, Dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means. She becomes a costumed vigilante, using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last= Beatty|first= Scott|author-link= Scott Beatty| contribution= Black Canary|editor-last= Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 50|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref> Dinah marries her lover, private eye Larry Lance, and several years later their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, is born (''Birds of Prey'' #66 (June 2004) would establish that they took the name "Laurel" from a librarian Dinah befriended during a case).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gail Simone|Simone, Gail]]|penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]|inker= Manley, Mike; Hanna, Scott; Golden, Michael|story= Sensei & Student Part Five Murder & Mystery|title= [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]|issue= #66|date=June 2004}}</ref>

===New 52 version===
During DC's [[The New 52]] era which began in 2011, Black Canary was portrayed as a single character with a metahuman Canary Cry resulting from government experiments on an alien child named Ditto. This version of Black Canary founded the Birds of Prey on her own, and led the super-team [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]] alongside her husband Kurt Lance, before later becoming lead singer in a rock band called Black Canary. After five years, DC later began to row back on controversial New 52 continuity changes with its [[DC Rebirth]] initiative, with the narrator of [[Geoff Johns]]' ''DC Rebirth'' #1, [[Wally West]], lamenting, from outside the universe, on how Black Canary and Green Arrow hardly know each other anymore, when they should be husband and wife, as a result of sinister alterations to the timeline. The comic shows the pair briefly meeting, by chance, and then separately staying up at night, contemplating what is missing from their lives. They meet again in ''Green Arrow Rebirth'' #1, and instantly hit it off. As part of Rebirth, Black Canary also re-establishes the traditional Birds of Prey line up with Batgirl and Huntress, and also joins the Justice League of America.

Following subsequent continuity-restoring events in ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'' and ''[[Dark Nights: Death Metal]]'', the current Black Canary is re-established as being the daughter of her Golden Age predecessor, fully reversing the controversial New 52 changes and bringing an end to the distinctive New 52 version of the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/batman-black-canary-mother-infinite-frontier/|title=Batman: Urban Legends Quietly Revives a Major Justice Society Legacy|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|last=Herbison|first=Andrew|date=19 August 2021|accessdate=19 August 2021}}</ref> The largely erased New 52 versions of the DC heroes were established as residing on Earth-52 in the comic book series ''Doomsday Clock''.<ref>"Discouraged of Man", ''Doomsday Clock'' #12,	[[Geoff Johns]], [[Gary Frank (comics)|Gary Frank]], [[Brad Anderson (colorist)|Brad Anderson]],	December 18, 2019</ref>

=={{anchor|Powers, abilities, and equipment}}Powers, abilities and equipment==
Although depictions of the Black Canary have varied over the years, the character is often portrayed as a prodigious hand-to-hand combatant, having mastered styles such as [[Aikido]],<ref>''Black Canary'' (vol. 3) #2 (September 2007)</ref> [[Boxing]], [[Capoeira]], [[Hapkido]], [[Judo]],<ref>''Green Arrow Annual'' (vol. 2) #1 (September 1988)</ref><ref>''Batman: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (October 1997)</ref><ref name="BlackCanaryMartialArts">''Birds of Prey'' #58 (October 2003)</ref> [[Jujutsu]], [[Kung Fu]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Okinawan martial arts|Shuri-te]],<ref name=BlackCanaryMartialArts /> and [[Wing Chun]].<ref>''JSA'' #14 (September 2000)</ref> She has been trained by other top-tier fighters, such as [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], [[Lady Shiva]], [[Cassandra Cain]], and [[Wonder Woman]], as well as having bested [[Batman]] from time to time in hand-to-hand combat.  In addition to her martial arts skills, the Black Canary has been depicted as an expert motorcyclist, gymnast, covert operative and investigator. She is also an excellent leader and tactician, having served as the field commander of the Birds of Prey and the leader of the Justice League and League of Assassins for a time.

Her superpower, the canary cry,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry|penciller= Tanghal, Romeo|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= Gravitational Boom-a-rang|title= [[World's Finest Comics]]|issue= #262|date= April–May 1980}}</ref> allows her to create ultrasonic vibrations whenever she screams, allowing her to severely damage both organic and inorganic objects. Her canary cry has been depicted as having 10-fold the capabilities of most [[sonic weapon]]s and has even been depicted as breaking metals and having the resonance to affect and shatter Earth.<ref name="Birds of Prey">{{cite comic| writer= Simone, Gail|penciller= [[Ed Benes|Benes, Ed]]; Melo, Adriana|inker= Benes, Ed; Benes, Mariah|story= Endrun, Part Two of Four: The Rage of the White Canary|title= Birds of Prey|volume= 2|issue= #2|date= August 2010}}</ref> In ''[[The New 52]]'', her canary cry now grants her the ability to glide and propel herself across long distances by screaming downwards.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Swierczynski, Duane|penciller= Foreman, Travel|inker= Foreman, Travel|story= Heat Seekers|title= Birds of Prey|volume= 3|issue= #10|date= August 2012}}</ref> Due to this reliance on speech, she is often bound and gagged by villains as a means of incapacitation. Despite her power, the Black Canary often relies on her martial arts skills instead, preferring to use her canary cry only during urgent situations, such as against superpowered opponents.

The origin of the Black Canary's canary cry has been retconned throughout her character history, with it being originally depicted as magical in origin due to being cursed by the Wizard. Later, the cry is depicted as an inborn [[metahuman]] ability. Briefly, during The New 52 era, her ability was depicted as resulting from gene-splicing experiments using samples from an alien girl named Ditto.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Fletcher, Brenden|penciller= [[Annie Wu (artist)|Wu, Annie]]|inker= Wu, Annie|story= Speed of Life|title= Black Canary|volume= 4|issue= #3|date= October 2015}}</ref>

== In other media ==
{{Main|Black Canary in other media}}
The Black Canary has appeared in live-action and animated adaptations of DC properties and video games based on comic books.

=== Television ===
==== Live action ====
The Black Canary's first live-action appearance was Danuta Wesley's 1979 portrayal in [[NBC]]'s two ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' specials.

The character appeared in the short-lived 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', an adaptation of the comic book. Dinah Lance became Dinah Redmond (played by [[Rachel Skarsten]]) a teenage runaway with psychic powers. Her mother Caroline Lance (played by [[Lori Loughlin]]) was the Black Canary with a supersonic canary cry.

In 2008, ''[[Smallville]]'' introduced the Black Canary (played by [[Alaina Huffman]]) as an assassin who is recruited for the Green Arrow's [[Justice League in other media#Live action|team of superheroes]]. She appears in several episodes, including several season premieres and finales.

In the 2012 television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and other series set in [[Arrowverse|its fictional universe]], [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Dinah Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]) is an attorney, and commonly goes by the name Laurel. Her younger sister, [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]) returns in [[Arrow (season 2)|season two]] after a six-year absence as a trained assassin for the [[League of Assassins]], working alongside the [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Arrow]] ([[Stephen Amell]]) to protect Starling City as a masked vigilante, the Canary. When she is murdered in [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]], Laurel takes up her sister's identity, operating as the Black Canary until her own murder in [[Arrow (season 4)|season four]]. In the spin-off show ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', a resurrected Sara Lance resumes heroism under the moniker White Canary as prompted by Laurel prior to her death. Cassidy later portrays Laurel's villainous [[Earth-Two]] metahuman doppelgänger, the Black Siren, on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and also in the [[Arrow (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''Arrow''. Cassidy reprises her role as the Black Siren on [[Arrow (season 6)|season six]] of ''Arrow'' as a series regular,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/arrow-katie-cassidy-cast-black-siren-laurel-lance-doppelganger-the-cw-1202053043/|title=Arrow:Katie Cassidy To Return As Black Siren, Will Be Regular In Season 6|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 27, 2017|access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref> who gradually redeems herself after working alongside Green Arrow, eventually becoming the Black Canary of Earth-2 before that universe is destroyed. Cassidy also appears in ''The Flash'' episode "[[Fury Rogue]]" as Siren-X, a Nazi-affiliated [[Crisis on Earth-X|Earth-X]] version of Laurel Lance. In its fifth season, ''Arrow'' introduces [[Dinah Drake (Arrowverse)|Dinah Drake]] ([[Juliana Harkavy]]) as the fourth Canary’s vigilante. Unrelated to the Lances, she is a former [[Central City Police Department]] officer who possesses a metahuman hypersonic cry similar to Black Siren's.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Second Chances|series=Arrow|credits=Speed Weed & Sarah Tarkoff (writers) & Mark Bunting (director)|network=The CW|airdate=February 1, 2017|season=5|number=11}}</ref> Harkavy was promoted to series regular for season six.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/04/arrow-rick-gonzalez-juliana-harkavy-wild-dog-black-canary-promoted-season-6-regulars-1202068856/|title=Arrow Ups Rick Gonzalaz & Juliana Harkavy To Season 6 Regulars|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=April 13, 2017|access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref> In September 2019, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirmed that The CW was developing a female-led spin-off series, with Katherine McNamara (who played Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoak's daughter, [[Mia Smoak]]), Katie Cassidy, and Juliana Harkavy as the leads, reprising their roles from ''Arrow''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-female-led-spinoff-works-at-cw-1242882|title='Arrow': Female-Led Spinoff in the Works at The CW|last1=Porter|first1=Rick|last2=Goldberg|first2=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 24, 2019|access-date=September 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925040602/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-female-led-spinoff-works-at-cw-1242882|archive-date=September 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The episode, titled "[[Green Arrow & The Canaries]]", aired as the penultimate episode of ''Arrow''{{'}}s [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth and final season]] on January 21, 2020, however, the series was not picked up. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2020/01/22/arrow-ratings-season-8-episode-9-canaries-spinoff/|title=Ratings: Arrow Spinoff Targets Season High in Viewers, Legends Returns Down|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|work=TVLine|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=September 2, 2020}}</ref>
