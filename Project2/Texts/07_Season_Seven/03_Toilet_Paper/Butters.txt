 I love art class! Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streibel's house got covered with toilet paper. I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves ''that'' kind of brutality.  Hey fellas! Yep. I'm in jail. Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I just can't get my behavior under control! Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here! Well I'm just a little asshole, is what ''I'' am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong! You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too. Hi, Dad. Yeah. Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.  Officer, can I stay in jail, please?
