Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you. Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley.  
 Henrietta, sweetie. Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess. We'll be waiting in the living room. Oh goodness I am so nervous.  Oh, a little family chit-chaaat. But Daddy and I ''love'' our little muffin, even if she's emo or not. Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz. Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.  Henrietta, I baked cookies for your new little Emo friends. Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me.  Henrietta, I have dinner ready. ...Fatty. }} 
You had a what? Oh.  That, that reminds me, so, Sheila, um, the girls and I were talking. Well, you seem so... great, and we thought how nice it would be for us to have a little bit of your poop. No, that's very true, isn't it? We were just thinking that your microbiome is so healthy now , and it would be nice to share a little.  And that is totally fine.  That cunt! I told you she'd say no! Hi Kyle. I'm Harriet, Henrietta and Bradley's mommy. I've been looking all over town for you.
