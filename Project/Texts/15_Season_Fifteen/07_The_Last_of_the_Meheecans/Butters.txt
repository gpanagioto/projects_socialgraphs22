Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!  Oh, what, I'm not a good Meheecan?  Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I ''am'' a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.  Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. M-mis amigos, my a-, my amigos are waiting. I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans. <poem><i>Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work</i></poem> Wow! A present just for me?  Ah, sí señor. <poem><i>All week long, bossman say</i></poem> <poem><i>Sing your Song, earn your pay</i></poem> <poem><i>Meheecan</i></poem> <poem><i>Meheecan, it's your</i></poem> <poem><i>While people play in the sun all day</i></poem> Hey, where are you going? Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone? So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla!  Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco! Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border? All my amigos are there, waitin' for me. Viva la Meheeco! We're crossin' the border! Olé! Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really- Wow. Thanks everyone.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.  ...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.  Game on!  AAAH! AAAAH!    Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee! Base!  So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even ''fit'' in my scrotum!"  Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
