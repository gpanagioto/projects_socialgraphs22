Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples. It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay. And these... are the two areas most important to- I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.  I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik. I go crazy. Yeah. Hmm.  G'oh, m'kay. Huh, what's wrong?
