 Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?  Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.  Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what? Oh boy! Oh thank God!    Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket. There's some chocolates and lih-liquorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside. Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later.  Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please.
