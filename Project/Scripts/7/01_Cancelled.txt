At the bus stop, day. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny wait. Ike hops into view

The boys

School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day...

Kyle

Ah, dammit!

Cartman

What?

Kyle

My Goddamn little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!

Ike

Suck my balls.

Kyle

No, Ike! You can't come to school with me.

Cartman

Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!

Kyle

Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!

Cartman

Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead! [the boys laugh, Kyle picks up Ike and swings him towards Cartman. Ike smacks Cartman in the face and Cartman falls on his back] Ow!

Stan

Dude, sweet! [Ike stands up]

Kyle

Yeah. Check it out. [sets up Ike and prepares for a kick] Ready Ike? Kick the baby!

Ike

Don't kick the Goddamn baby!

Kyle

Kick the baby!

Ike

Waaaah-- [flies across the street and lands in some snow on the other side] Ow.

Cartman

[gets up and yawns]

Kyle

Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.

Cartman

That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.

Kyle

Really? What about?

Cartman

Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed… [the dream sequence begins] in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room [his window flies open and a bright beam blinds him as he rises to see what it is]. Then slowly my bedroom door began to open [a glow appears around the door as an alien peeks inside] and the next thing I remember I was being drugged through a hallway. [This hallway has specimens on either side of it. "Weeaak!"] Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me. [four aliens hover over him and lower his pajama pants as a robot arm nearby gets to work on his ass] And they had big heads and big black eyes…

Stan

Dude! Visitors!

Kyle

Totally!

Cartman

What?

Stan

That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!

Cartman

No, it was just a dream, [crosses his arms] my mom said so.

Stan

Visitors are real. They... [lowers his left eyebrow and thinks, looking down] Wait a minute. This has all happened before.

Kyle

Yeah. This does seem really familiar.

Cartman

What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?

Kyle

Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?

Cartman

Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.

Stan

No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?

Cartman

No I don't remember that!

Kyle

You don't?

Cartman

No, because the aliens erased my memory!

Stan

I remember this whole thing. [to Kyle] Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.

Kyle

Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. [the sound of wheels approaching]

Chef

[pulling up in his station wagon, steps out] Hello there, children! [silence]

Kyle

[to Stan] And then you said...

Stan

What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?

Chef

Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles

All

and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley.

Kyle

Weird

Chef

Say, did any of you children

All

see the alien space ship last night?

Chef

What the?

Stan

Chef, we're in a repeat.

Chef

A repeat??

Kyle

Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.

Cartman

Aw dude, I hate repeats!

Chef

[walks around and stands behind the boys] I've been feelin' Déjà vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!

Stan

It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.

Chef

We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.

-----


South Park Medical Clinic. Inside, Chef and the boys wait on chairs as Cartman lies face down on a proctologist's table.

Kyle

What is a proc-tologist, Chef?

Chef

He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.

Stan

You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.

Chef

That's right.

Kyle

What a dick!

Proctologist

[entering] Hello everyone! [walks towards Cartman]

Chef

Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.

Proctologist

What seems to be the problem?

Chef

We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.

Kyle

Other than his monstrous size.

Cartman

[whips an angry look at him] SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! [pulls his head back and rests it on his left hand]

Proctologist

All right, let's see here. [raises the blanket and looks down] Oh my God!!

Cartman

What?

Proctologist

Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle! [beat. The doctor begins to laugh]

Cartman

[displeased] Haha, very funny.

Stan

Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.

Proctologist

[chuckles] All right, let's take a look. [snaps on a yellow latex glove and plunges a finger into the butthole]

Cartman

Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?

Chef

Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.

Kyle

And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.

Cartman

Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Ooh. Oww...

Proctologist

Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...

Cartman

Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooh-ah. Uuuuu, aaaaah.

Proctologist

Wait, what's this? [the anal probe appears once again and the doctor jumps out of the way. The probe stretches out and clears away part of the clinic on its way to full height. A large hole is left on the building as the satellite dish juts out from it.]

Kyle

Are you okay?

Cartman

[with a dreamy, relieved look] Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome. [smiles]

Chef

Well, doctor?

Proctologist

[slowly] I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream.

Cartman

[the probe collapses and sinks back into his ass] Aaaaaa, aaaaaah! Ooagh!

Stan

You all right?

Cartman

You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!

Proctologist

I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.

Chef

That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!

Stan

Where to now, Chef?

Chef

That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! [as they leave the clinic they pass the receptionist's window. A receptionist with a weird white face and yellow hair looks on as they leave. She then removes her wig and shows that she's a Visitor.]

-----


The space center. Lots of satellite dishes dot the premises. Inside Chef leads the children to a scientist.

Chef

And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.

Jeff

How do we uh, make it come out?

Chef

Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.

Cartman

[crosses his arms] Ohhh no, no no no no! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. [grins]

Kyle

What!? No way! [looks to his left and points] You do it, Kenny!

Cartman

Nope! It has to be Kyle!

Stan

Go on.

Kyle

I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!

Chef

Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.

Cartman

[lowers his pants and moons Kyle] Come, Kyle. Do hurry. [Kyle moves tentatively toward Cartman and bares his left arm] Go ahead, it won't bite. [Kyle raises his arm and move in. Cartman farts and Kyle angrily lowers his arm. Cartman and Kenny laugh]

Kyle

God-damnit Cartman!

Cartman

[laughing] I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]

Kyle

Stop it Cartman!

Cartman

[laughing] Okay. Okay okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]

Kenny

[laughing] (Gaaahaha, he got you again!)

Kyle

God Dammit!

Cartman

[laughing] Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm, looking at the other guys.] Gahaaa! Derrr!

Kenny

[laughs, then echoes Cartman] (Derrr!)

Cartman

Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Oh yes it is! [swats the odor towards Kyle.]

Kenny

[laughs, then echoes Cartman] (Yes it is!)

Chef

Eric, that's enough!

Cartman

Okay, okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohh, double psych!

Kyle

That's it! [walks off] I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!

Stan

Oh, nice going, Cartman!

Cartman

All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.

Kyle

No!

Cartman

No, go ahead. I'm dry.

Kyle

You're lying!

Chef

It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!

Cartman

But it was one of the best times I've ever had.

Jeff

Can I see this thing, please?

Cartman

Okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohhh! God-dammit! [Cartman, Kenny, and Chef laugh]

Chef

Okay. Now it's funny again.

Cartman

This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.

Kyle

That does it! CHARGE! [drives his finger into Cartman's butthole. Cartman farts and screams as the anal probe shoot out of his ass. The probe opens up into the satellite dish and the dish sends a beam into outer space. Part of the space center is destroyed in the process]

Chef

What's it doing?

Jeff

It, it's sending a transmission of some kind. [sits at a console and types away] Got it! [on several screen above the keyboard, images from around the planet pop up and change every second or so.]

Kyle

It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.

Chef

Where is the signal being sent to? [the signal cuts off and the anal probe shrinks back into Cartman's ass. Cartman screams as it does so.]

Cartman

Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.

Kyle

We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?

Stan

We wanted to see an alien planet or something.

Jeff

Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars.

Kyle

Candy bars?

Jeff

You-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... polar-- polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to! [turns around and types away on the console. The power cuts out and the center goes dark.] What the heck? [the sound of heavy ships is heard, and two bright beams light up the room. Everyone looks towards a window. Outside, a visitor walks up and looks in through one end window. A second one looks through the other end window. The windows shatter] They're coming in! [a glow appears outside a door and permeates it. The door shuts and two visitors enter. The other two come in through the window and the four of them converge on the boys, Chef, and Jeff.]

Stan

What do we do???

Cartman

[steps forward and points to Jeff] It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!

Jeff

What?? [the visitors go after Jeff, and the others make their escape]

Chef

Help!

Kyle

Aaaah! Runrunruuun! [the group makes it outside]

Stan

Let's go!

Chef

Get in the car, children! Get in the car! [they all scramble in and Chef peels away from the center. He drives down the road towards South Park. Another car appears behind then and throws up its headlights. Its horn honks a few times]

Stan

[startled] What is that?

Chef

Can you see anything, children? [Kyle looks back]

Kyle

[turns back] The aliens are chasing us! [a close-up of the four aliens in the car behind Chef. A passenger-side visitor leans out and draws a revolver, shooting at Chef. A bullet strikes the rear window and the boys jump]

Chef

God damned aliens! [the two cars move down the road with the visitors still shooting]

Stan

Chef! End of the road! [several barricades are up, with STOP signs hanging on the, and one sign saying "ROAD CLOSED"]

Chef

Hold on, children! [Cartman looks at the visitors] We have to ditch them! [steps on the gas pedal]

Cartman

What are you doing, man?! [Chef drives towards the barricade and goes up a wooden ramp, into the air.]

Narrator

[some backwoods music plays in the background in freeze-frame] Looks like the boys are gettin' a little fresh air. [the wagon lands on the other side of a pothole and continues. The visitors try the same jump, but they launch into the air and off the road, towards a chicken coop. They crash through the roof and land right in the middle of the coop. Chickens ]

Kyle

[looks out and back] I think we ditched them.

Chef

I don't think we're outta the woods yet. [They pass a sign saying "eat BIG PIG'S BBQ" with a pig in a white Southern suit. Behind the billboard, a police car pulls out and pursues Chef. There are two visitors in the car]

Visitor Driver

Coop coop.

Stan

It's the police!

Chef

That ain't no police! [for some reason, two workers are moving a large glass pane across the road. Chef heads on down and crashes through it. The police cruiser follows]

Cartman

When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.

Stan

Chef!! [Chef sees yet another barricade and goes towards it, forcing the worker guarding it to jump out of the way/ Chef launches into the air once again. "Dixie" is heard from the car's horn. The aliens catch up to Chef and the boys and try the same jump. They end up upside down and unable to move. Chef spins the car a bit and looks back at the police cruiser]

Chef

[jumps out and approaches the police car] HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you! [a beam lights up the car] Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! [the car begins to rise slowly]

The boys

Chef! Chef! They've got us!

Chef

You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to... [notices the weird sounds behind him and turns] Huh? [looks up to see the station wagon hovering near the entrance to the ship] Aw crap! Children!

The boys

Cheeeeeeef!

Narrator

[the picture freezes] Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too.

-----


A chamber. Stan is tied up in some green alien pod, asleep.

Stan

Uh. [stirs and opens his eyes] Wugh. You guys. Wake up! [the other boys are in pods of their own]

Kyle

[stirs in his own pod] What the? Where are, where are we?

Stan

We're in the alien ship.

Cartman

Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass! [panics] Oh God, help me, you guys!

Kyle

It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.

Cartman

[looks down] ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you, Lord.

Stan

[out of his pod] Guys. Look. [the others get out of theirs and walk towards Stan]

Kyle, Cartman

Wow. [they face a massive window, through which they get a good view of Earth getting farther and farther away]

Stan

My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.

Kyle

Yeah.

Kenny

(Awesome)

Cartman

This is like my fifth time. [the room brightens and two doors open at the other end of the room. The boys turn and face it]

Stan

Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.

Kenny

(Oh no!) [tightens the hood on his face. The man enters... it appears to be Stan's father.]

Alien

Hello boys.

Stan

Dad?

Alien

No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you.

Kyle

Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.

Stan

Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.

Cartman

Aw God, that movie pissed me off.

Alien

Very well, I shall show my true form. [a quick transformation into a hideous monster] Rah rah rah rah-rah. Rah rah rah rah.

The boys

[shielding their eyes] AAAAH!

Stan

Okay okay, take the form of something else!

Alien

[transforms again] How's this? [the boys move their arms off their eyes to behold Santa]

Cartman

Santa!

Stan

Nno, that's stupid too. [Cartman looks at Stan, deflated]

Alien

How about this? [transforms into Michael Jordan, Bulls form]

Stan, Kyle, Cartman

No. [the alien turns into Don King] No! [then into Mr. Roarke and Tattoo]

Cartman

[impressed] Oooo, very nice.

Stan

No! [the alien turns into George Burns]

Kyle

No! [the alien turns into J.J. Walker]

Alien

Dy-no-mite!

The boys

No!

-----


Back at the space center, day. Jeff is cleaning up after the destruction left behind by the visitors

Chef

[with flashlight] Jeff!! The aliens took the children upon their ship.

Jeff

Oh no!

Chef

Did you find out what the aliens were up to?

Jeff

When I reversed the polarities, I found this: [sits at the console and starts pressing keys. 1s and 0s flash across a screen] It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says.

Chef

They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!

Jeff

[spins around] Wait a minute! Butt sex!

Chef

Butt sex?

Jeff

Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh-- Chupacabra's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usually have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code! [spins back and works on decoding it]

Chef

Who's havin' butt sex?

-----


Back on the alien ship

Alien

[prances as Saddam] Hello my honey, hello my baby, hello my ragtime gal! [ends on his knees, arms wide open]

The boys

[getting bored] No!

Alien

[transforms into Missy Elliot] Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh huh.

The boys

No! [Stan is irritated]

Alien

[transforms into Frank Sinatra] Don't piss on the moon, babe.

The boys

NO!

Alien

All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take? [the boys fall silent]

Cartman

How about a taco, that craps ice cream? [the alien transforms into the taco. A wad of ice cream falls out of him] Guys?

Stan

I like it.

Kenny

(Me too.) [the boys clap]

Alien

All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings. [leads the boys into another room, leaving scoops of ice cream behind, in various flavors] I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay.

Stan

You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?

Alien

That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning.

Kyle

Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?

Alien

Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches. [enters the next room]

Stan

[looks back at his friends] Television? [the boys enter the next room. In that room visitors are all over the place manning the various aspects of a production company]

Alien

We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] We started with great shows like, "Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek?" and "Antares 6 Millionaire". And then we had a big hit with "Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian". But then, of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time. [he looks at a giant screen on which Earth is shown]

Kyle

Earth?

Alien

A few billion years ago we realized, "what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer, and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great! [the boys are stunned at what they're hearing]

Stan

Our planet is just a reality-TV show?

Alien

Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!

Kyle

You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.

Alien

Why?

Stan

Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!

Cartman

Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! [the boys just look at each other]

-----


The Convention Center, day.

Jeff

Ladies and Gentlemen, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe. [murmurs rise up in the audience] When decoded, it looks like this. [he begins the transmission and graphics sweep by. First, the binary code appears, then a dazzling sun behind the Earth, then a tracking shot leading to Earth, then an undernourished boy, then a caravan walking across a desert, people putting on protective glasses, an atomic blast, deer running, a couple, a time-lapse night scene, the Eiffel Tower, two men hammering at something, an ethnic festival. The sound is garbled]

Man

[rising] What does it mean?

Jeff

It's a simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this. [replays the transmission, this time in English]

Announcer

This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!

Jeff

I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show.

Man 2

My God. We're famous! [everyone stands and whoops it up]

Jeff

Waaaait, you don't understand!

Man 3

[giddy blond] I'm on TV! I'm on TV!

Man 4

This is so awesome! [everyone clear out, cheering]

Others

Woo! Yeah! Woohoo!! [Jeff is left all alone]

-----


Back at Nerzod Productions. Cartman is bent over once more, with his pants down. The visitors have finished working on him

Alien

That should get the relay working again. [begins to walk off. The boys follow] All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth. [a visitor brings him a ringing phone] Oh, excuse me. [picks up the receiver] This is Nagix. Uh-huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks. [hangs up the phone and walks back to the boys] Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been canceled.

Kyle

What?? Who canceled us?

Najix

The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be funny anymore. [walks off to address the rest of the staff]

Stan

Oh shit, did we do that?

Najix

Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid Earth has been canceled

Staff

Awww.

Najix

Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud. [a smattering of applause] Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources.

Stan

Wait! Wait, they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!

Najix

Wouldn't do any good.

Kyle

Dude, we have to try!

Stan

Please, take us to them! Please!

Najix

All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody. [the boys look at each other, and several more scoops of ice cream falls out of the alien's taco ass]

-----


Earth. A view of it from outer space. A few seconds later, an immense crane floats towards Earth with a wrecking ball ready and beeper going. It stops. Two alien laborers sit inside and the driver activates the crane arm. The wrecking ball moves and strikes western Africa. A shot of people running across a bridge. The whole planet moves as if by an earthquake. Chef almost loses his balance at the space center as the ground undulates.

Chef

What the hell is that?!

Jeff

There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit! [schematics of the ship and Earth appear on screen, and the impact point is shown as well] But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory!

Chef

Chaos theory??

Jeff

Chaos theory, it was, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of Punky Brewster before it was canceled. Cancelled...

Chef

Huh?

Jeff

Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are canceling Earth!

Chef

Oh my God! We have to stop them!

-----


The boys walk down a futuristic sidewalk on a strange planet.

Voice

Welcome to Planet Fognl, home of the Joozians, who control all media in the universe. [the boys enter the universal network headquarters]

Receptionist

Can I help you?

Stan

Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?

Receptionist

Where are you visiting from?

Stan

Uh, Earth?

Receptionist

Ooooh, I watch that show all the time. [opens another set of doors and shows the boys in]

Joozian 1

Gaaahahaha! [notices the boys come in] Oh, sure, come on in, Earthlings. We're just checking out our new show.

Joozian 2

We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. It-it's a riot!

Joozian 1

They hate each other!

Joozian 2

Gah, why? [Stan nudges Kyle, who pulls a letter out from his pocket and reads]

Kyle

Mighty, powerful network executives, we have come in a great distance in order to have--

Joozian 1

Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have haglar yet?

Joozian 2

Oh yeah, let's do haglar.

Joozian 1

Where do you wanna go? Meroni's?

Joozian 2

Not on a Flakmar, too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch!

Joozian 1

Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect.

-----


Blackafelch Restaurant, later. Aliens of all kinds sit and enjoy their meals.

Joozian 2

This place is fantastic!

Stan

Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.

Kyle

[Begging, with his hands together] Please don't cancel us. Please.

Joozian 1

[Both Joozians are holding menus] Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business.

Joozian 2

You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!

Joozian 1

Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings.

Waitress

[another Joozian] Here's your order of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah. [sets a large platter before the executives and lifts the cover. The executives dig in]

Stan

But, sirs, we think our show is just getting good. [Kyle thinks about the food, then decides to pick up a fork-full and taste it] I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.

Kyle

Oh my God, this is great!

Joozian 1

You must have some Joozian ancestry.

Cartman

[miffed at the link, rests his head on his left hand] Tell us about it.

Stan

Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.

Joozian 1

Oh my God, would you look at the heglars on that joozinek?

Stan

Dude, we're trying to save our planet here!

Joozian 1

Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah!

Joozian 2

Oh, yeah!

-----


A hekmabah, a Joozian strip club. A Joozinek slithers around a dance pole

Joozian 1

Oh yeah, let's see those heglars!

Stan

Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-

Joozian 1

Oh, man, I am so wasted! [holds up a little box] Hey, do you Earthlings wanna try a little glach? [takes the box and pours out a line of purple powder. The other Joozian snorts it right up. The boys look on, saying nothing. Another line of purple powder and the first Joozian snorts up, then suddenly turns around] Agh-oh yeah!! [turns back] Oh, gluck yeah!! [Kenny begins snorting up at the other end of the line]

Kyle

Kenny! [Kenny stops]

Joozian 1

Man, screw this place! Let's go get a hotel room and a hooker!

Joozian 2

Oh yeah!

Joozian 1

Yeah! [they leave their chairs]

Back on earth, the massive cranes swings at Earth again. More quakes follow and the space center is damaged some more

Chef

We have to find a way to stop those aliens!

Jeff

[begins pacing] Oh, their ship is massive! There's no way to stop it! [stops] Wait a minute, jackets!

Chef

[smacks his hand onto his head] Oh no.

Jeff

If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A virus- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!

Chef

[thinks, then angrily] That doesn't make any Goddamn sense!

An adult hotel. The Joozians are in bed with a hooker and they begin to disrobe.

Joozian 1

Oh yeah!

Joozian 2

Good.

Joozian 1

Oh yeah! Yeah!!

Joozian 2

Woohoohoo! Yeah!

Joozian 1

[goes to take another snort of purple powder. With his shirt off, one can see two small appendages, one on each shoulder] Booyagh! Boy, Earthlings, is this a party or what?? [the boys sit on a couch looking on, bored.]

Joozian 2

Oh! Oh, that's it, baby! You're getting my jagon hard! [the appendage on his right shoulder stiffens and lengthens]

Joozian 1

[returns to the side of the bed, by the second Joozian] Wohh. Yeah, let's party! [begins to suck on the Joozian's jagon]

Joozian 2

Yeah, suck my jagon!

Joozian 1

[stops and releases] Yeah! Now you suck on my jagon! [the second Joozian begins to suck on his jagon] Oh yeah!! Stick your finger in my thrusher! [the second Joozian begins putting his finger into some openings above the first Joozian's waist] Oh yeah, suck it! Suck that jagon! [the boys show more interest and some astonishment]

Stan

Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. [Kenny whips out a camera and takes a picture]

Joozian 1

[the other Joozian continues sucking on his jagon] Oh yeah!! Oh yeah, yeah-yeah! Oh yeah!

-----


Back at universal network headquarters. The Joozians have ice packs on their heads, recovering from the raunch they experienced the night before

Joozian 2

Oh, God. Eh, my head. [the four boys look on] What did we do?

Joozian 1

Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your jagon.

Joozian 2

Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right??

Cartman

No.

Stan

[glances at Cartman and quickly thinks] No, wait. We won't tell anybody if you don't cancel our show!

Joozian 1

Oooo, I knew that was coming.

Joozian 2

They really got us by the nezmins.

Kyle

The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.

Stan

I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.

Cartman

There's even World War Three to look forward to.

Kyle

And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.

Joozian 1

He-all right, all right Earthlings! Ya, you win! The show can stay on.

The boys

All right!

Joozian 1

Just be sure to keep up the wars and violence.

Joozian 2

Well, we've got a five o'clock with the Yurka producers. [still disheveled, he hops off his chair and goes to a lever] Nice meeting you Earthlings. Bye! [pulls the lever down and in an instant, the boys are back at the bus stop]

-----


The bus stop, day. Kenny is missing.

Cartman

[yawns] Uuugh.

Kyle

Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.

Cartman

That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.

Kenny

[walks up with something in his hand] (Hey you guys, look.) [the other boys look]

Kyle

What the hell is that?

Kenny

(I don't know.)

Chef

[drives up in his station wagon and steps out] Hello there, children!

The boys

Hey Chef. [Chef steps behind the boys]

Stan

Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. [Chef takes a look at the picture of the two Joozians sucking each other's jagons]

Cartman

What is it, Chef?

Chef

I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children. [hands the picture back to Kenny] You should hang on to it.
