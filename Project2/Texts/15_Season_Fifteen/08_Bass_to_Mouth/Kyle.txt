The blond kid?  How do you know?! What's that? Dude, that's so wrong! What's up? Dude, that's fucked up. It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see?? That's not funny.  I'm not looking at that! It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you! So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right? Where is it coming from? If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room. Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?! One.  Get it!  Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks. What? What is that thing? Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat! Here's a shoebox!  Grab him!  What the hell happened?! Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
