Denver archdiocese. The Lord be with you.  All right, listen to me carefully. Your local priest has not done anything wrong. He's probably just taking some time off. Why is that suspicious? We'll take care of it. There's no need to involve the authorities. Just sit tight.  We've got another one. A priest on South Park has gone rogue and is probably out doing his thing. I need you guys to get up there and clean up his mess.
