Are you the owner of this restaurant? I'd like to do business with you. Your establishment here is perfect for my plant-based meats. You see, I am a goo man. If you carry my product, Incredible Meats, we can put the word Incredible before all of your dishes. That is correct. That's right. That is most excellent.  Now, how many customers, on avarage, do you have per day?  That's it? What is Tegridy Burger? Is that so?!  I've been in your town a little while now. What I see is a community that is ready for change. You see, I am a goo man.  This my new regional manager, H.W.

Have you done what I've asked you to do?  Well if you don't mind boys, I have work to tend to.
