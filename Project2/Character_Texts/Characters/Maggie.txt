Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry. Quitting the force? You?  Where're you goin'? 
Harrison Yates, what's gotten into you? What are ya talkin' about? You said that protectin' people from bad dinin' experiences was what kept you goin'. What is it? You want me to come along? 
Harrison Yates, where have ya been?! I haven't seen ya in days. I've missed you so much. Come have some supper with me. I just played a little bit. You're never home anymore! With all these school shootings! I need a life too, you know?! ISo I robbed a lumber mill in Monto's rest, upgraded my horse and got a sniper rifle. Why can't we have a life together?! Where are ya going?! You can;t possibly go all the way back to the snow level again! 
 So what of it?! No! No, this is my life now, Harrison Yates! I started over, with me own saved game! See for yourself. I built a house with John Marston! I'm helpin' his family now!  A basic starter horse and the $20 gambler's that you won at a poker match! I'm twice the man you are now! I'll talk however I want!  I'm not tellin'! You wanted your now life and now you got it!
