I'm busy.  I'm busy doing stuff!  What?! Uh-uh yes? Uh yeah, we just uh, we're having an important scheduling to go over. That's in the past, Mackey! We've paid our dues, and we're not hiding anything anymore. What's going on?? All right, what word did you use, Riley?! Look, can't we put them in a daycare? Well maybe they won't! I don't know what makes you think you're different from everyone else, but nobody gets away with slandering teachers at this school! Hey!  Just what do you think you're doing? There are no boxes on your head in school! What are you talking about? Oh hey, I just needed to answer a couple of e-mails really fast. I got one for you, too.  Look, you and I have been having a lot of problems. Clearly, what we both need is more quality one-on-one time with our phones. I'm sorry!  It's okay. We're gonna find them. You were on your phone too! You're seriously gonna make this all my fault?! Because last time I checked, you didn't even want me around as a partner to the PC Babies, even though I- Even though you need me to do shit for you every  I'm her superior at work! You think I took advantage of my position?! I'm not Harvey Weinstein, all right?! I have nothing but respect for females at my workplace, and I would never compromise that position!

We missed everything because... we were on our phones. You know what we have to do, right? All right everyone, listen up. The vice principal and I have been discussing student health, and it's our firm belief that they need, and what we all need, is less time on our phones.  Yeah... Nobody's listening. And nobody's watching.
