Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome. Who's joking?  You have AIDS?  Wow! Casa Bonita?! Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff! This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita!'' You... your Mom said you could take three friends. Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny? Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?! I have never been a dick to you. Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?  Okay, except maybe for that ''one'' time. Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place   Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.  Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!   Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!  What isn't it? ...I don't understand the difference. Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something. Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people? Okay, so how do you act ''genuinely'' nice to people? Like what? Who's there? Take that, Jimmy!  Oh, Kyle. Hey. Uh...  Knock knock, Kyle! Hey Kyle. Well what? I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go. So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool. I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later.  I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore. Good. Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!  Butters, can you keep a secret? For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible. A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth. Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...''pray'' that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything? Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust. Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer?  Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth. I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus. According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours. No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter! Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry!  Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here!   All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks. No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth. Well, you know, with your wiener.   Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present. Hope you have a good one. See you later.  Yes?  Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything? Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.  Casa Bonita, here we come! ''Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!''  Well, let's get going, shall we?  Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would ''want'' us to go. You know Butters... Next Saturday?? I'll ''never'' be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.  Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!  Butters! Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!  The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time... There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.  No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh... We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can.  Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.  What what what? UUuuugh!!   Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way! The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals! They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive. We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins. Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location.  Good. Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town. All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice.  Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble. We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter. Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God! It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!   We've got to fight them off!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!  Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!   which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well. We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you! Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you! Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter. I love you too, man. I just  Hah!  Oh, that would be so bad-ass! ''We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon.'' You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.  "Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show. What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle. ''Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]'' We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great! But... Casa Bonita.  Stand back!   Less than a minute! Less than a minute! Oh, awesome!!   Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!   Yeeeesss! Totally.
