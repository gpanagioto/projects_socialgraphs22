'''N'Kantu the Living Mummy''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character's first run was from 1973 to 1975, and was based on the popular [[mummy (undead)|undead mummy]] trope of horror fiction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Banes |first1=Steve |last2=Yoe |first2=Craig |title=Mummies!: Classic Monsters of Pre-Code Horror Comics |date=2017 |publisher=IDW Publishing |isbn=9781684062478 |page=13}}</ref>

==Publication history==
N'Kantu the Living Mummy first appeared in ''[[Supernatural Thrillers]]'' #5 (August [[1973 in comics|1973]]), created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Rich Buckler]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=101}}</ref> It introduced the character in a standalone story set in [[Cairo, Egypt]], "The Living Mummy". N'Kantu the Living Mummy returned two issues later in "The Return of the Living Mummy" by the same team, who brought the character to [[New York City]]. With the cover logo reading "Supernatural Thrillers featuring The Living Mummy", the series ran from #7 to the final issue, #15 (June 1974 - Oct. 1975). With issue #8, the creative team became writer [[Tony Isabella]] and artist Val Mayerik, occasionally credited as co-plotter. [[John Warner (comics)|John Warner]] wrote or co-wrote the final two issues, with [[Tom Sutton]] drawing the finale. [[Len Wein]] scripted #10 from an Isabella-Mayerik plot.

N'Katu was revived in 1983 for an issue of ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' (issue #95, January 1983), teamed up with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Flashback: Marvel Scream-Up |journal=Back Issue |date=October 2019 |issue=#116 |page=37 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born 3,000 years ago, N'Kantu is the son of T'Chombi, a chief of a Northern [[Africa]]n tribe called the Swarili of the nation of Swarilis. At the age of 21, N'Kantu must undergo the Test of the Lion, proving himself to be worthy of being called a warrior. Succeeding in this trial also means that someday N'Kantu would be worthy to succeed his father as king. Months later, his father dies in his sleep, and N'Kantu becomes the chieftain of the Swarili tribe.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

Returning from a hunt, N'Kantu finds that his village has been ransacked and the entire tribe of Swarili rounded up by [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] as slaves. N'Kantu fights to rescue his people, but is overwhelmed and captured by the Egyptian soldiers.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

N'Kantu and the Swarili are then taken to Egypt, and put to work building monuments to the current Pharaoh, Aram-Set. Recognized as the strongest, and most dangerous of the Swarili, N'Kantu is isolated and forced to work the hardest in an attempt to break his spirit. But at night he and the other Swarili people plot a rebellion, though unbeknownst to them their plotting is being reported to Aram-Set and his chief priest, Nephrus.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/nephrusn.htm Nephrus] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> At the completion of the current monument project, the Egyptians take their slaves into its catacombs in preparation for a mass execution. But N'Kantu signals for the revolt and the Swarili slaughter their would-be executioners.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

N'Kantu slays Aram-Set with his spear and then turns to Nephrus, but the evil priest had prepared, and he sprays N'Kantu in the face with a mysterious paralyzing liquid. N'Kantu is then strapped and bound to a special altar, his body wrapped in [[papyrus]], and his blood is drained and replaced with an unknown [[Alchemy|alchemical]] [[preservative]]. N'Kantu, who remains conscious through the entire ordeal, is then placed inside a stone [[sarcophagus]].<ref>origin recounted in ''Supernatural Thrillers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Soon afterward, N'Kantu was seen as one of the heroes against the Super-hero Registration Act which was forged during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event; it is later explained that N'Kantu began to feel his service in the Howling Commandos was slavery, prompting his rebellion.<ref>''Civil War Battle Damage Report''.

He was transported to his cell alongside [[Coldblood]], [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]], and [[Typeface (comics)|Typeface]].

Nephrus was unable to do that, but it did attract [[Anubis (Marvel Comics)|Anubis]] when Nephrus' spirit was drawn from his realm. N'Kantu agreed to become Anubis' agent to kill people and send their souls to him in exchange for N'Kantu moving on to the afterlife.<ref>''Legion of Monsters: Satana'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of the transfusion of an unknown embalming fluid by the Egyptian high priest Nephrus, N'Kantu has superhuman strength and durability. He is highly resistant to many forms of attack. Although his skin is almost rock-hard in consistency, his wrappings are extremely vulnerable to fire. His blood has been replaced with an alchemical preservative that has allowed him to exist for over three thousand years. He also has no need for food, water, oxygen, or sleep.

N'Kantu is able to sense mystical energy and the use of magic. He can also sense and recognize Nephrus' descendants. His body no longer produces saliva, which makes speaking difficult and painful for him. He is nevertheless proficient in ancient Swarili, Egyptian and English. He is extremely sensitive to any dehydrative process which interferes with the preservative fluid in his veins.

He has the combat skills of the Swarili warrior class. Some of these abilities are enhanced by his mummified condition, while others are diminished.
