'''Aragorn''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[winged horse]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Aragorn has served as a mount for various characters.

==Fictional character biography==
===First Aragorn===
Professor Nathan Garrett, the criminal [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]], developed genetic engineering techniques capable of granting a horse the wings of a bird. He used it to create a mount to ride during his criminal adventures.<ref>''The Avengers'' #48</ref> After Garrett's final defeat by [[Iron Man]],<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #73</ref> this horse escaped, was found and further mutated by Victor Frankenstein's great-granddaughter Victoria (who had originally tried to restore it to normal), and fell into the possession of the [[Dreadknight]], who named it the '''Hellhorse'''.<ref>''Iron Man'' #101-102</ref>

===Second Aragorn===
As Garrett was dying, he persuades his nephew Dane Whitman to take his scientific discoveries and use them for good. Whitman thus became a new, heroic [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], and used his uncle's techniques to create another winged horse. This one he names Aragorn and uses as his mount.<ref>''The Avengers'' #48</ref> Aragorn helped the Black Knight and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battle the [[Masters of Evil]];<ref>''The Avengers'' #55</ref> carried the Black Knight into battle against Le Sabre;<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 2 #17</ref> helped the Black Knight and [[Doctor Strange]] battle [[Tiboro]];<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #178</ref> carried the Black Knight alongside Doctor Strange and the Avengers as they battled [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] and [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]];<ref>''The Avengers'' #61</ref> carried the Black Knight to [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]] to battle [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]],<ref>''The Avengers'' #100</ref> among numerous other adventures together.

When the Black Knight was turned into stone by the Enchantress, Aragorn was placed in the custody of his fellow [[Defenders (comics)|Defender]], the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #4</ref> Aragorn carried the Valkyrie and [[Namorita]] into battle against the [[Omegatron]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #5</ref> When Whitman left his own time to stay for a while in the 12th century AD, he entrusted Aragorn to the care of the Valkyrie, who became his permanent companion.<ref>''The Defenders'' #11</ref> He came to live at the Richmond Riding Academy.<ref>''The Defenders'' #17</ref> He accompanied the Valkyrie to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and Valhalla, and helped the Valkyrie, [[Harokin]], and the Defenders battle [[Ollerus (comics)|Ollerus]] and [[Casiolena]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #66-68</ref> With the Valkyrie, Aragorn helped form the New Defenders.<ref>''The Defenders'' #126</ref>

While Aragorn was with the Valkyrie, Dane Whitman gained a new flying horse named Strider from the [[Lady of the Lake]].<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #2</ref>

Aragorn is still in the company of the Valkyrie.<ref>''Hulk'' #7, ''She-Hulk'' #34</ref>

===Third Aragorn===
Another Aragon served as a steed to Augustine du Lac, who was the Vatican Black Knight. He rode Aragorn at the time when he accompanied [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] in his invasion of [[Wakanda]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #3</ref>

When [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s son [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superbeings, Aragorn is clearly seen in one of the cages. However, after disobeying Kraven, Aragorn was killed to set an example to his other captives and then served up as food.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #13-14</ref> The ''Marvel Pets Handbook'' confirmed that the Aragorn that was killed by Alyosha Kravinoff was the Vatican Black Knight's Aragorn.<ref>''Marvel Pets Handbook''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Aragorn was a normal horse until [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]] used [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]'s techniques to give him large, fully feathered wings that allow him to fly. He is an experienced battle steed on land and aloft. Aragorn's enhanced intelligence gives him an excellent rapport with both the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and Dane Whitman, enabling him to understand and obey complex commands.
