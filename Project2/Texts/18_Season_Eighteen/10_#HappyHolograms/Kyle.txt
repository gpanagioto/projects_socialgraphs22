I'm NOT a GRANDPA! Whattaya think? Really?? Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome." But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values. Bill Cosby. Is here. To see me. Hello. We? Wow.  Well that's awesome! M-Ah, I'd love to. Uh okay! No problem!  Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!  Dude, what are you doing?! They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending! These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it! No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now! Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room. That son of a bitch! Why would he do this?! Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?! Mom?! Where is Ike?! That's ''not'' what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?! Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room! WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS! Cartman, open this door right now! What the hell are you doing?! Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door! Because you just said, "here in my room"! What are you talking about, Stan? Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped. I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.  Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad. How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you? I am so confused.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again. Help? How can you help? Really? That's what you guys would do? Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!  PewDiePie?! Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night. Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats. No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
