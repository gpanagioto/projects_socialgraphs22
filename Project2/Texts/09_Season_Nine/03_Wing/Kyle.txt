How come we never get opportunities like that? We're not talented? Probably. Why? Can I talk to you?!  What the hell are you doing?! Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years! Yes he does! Tolkien actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass! Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You ''need'' somebody to manage it all for you. Welcome to the team, Tolkien. We knew you could do it! Twenty dollars. Mister, you can't do this to us! All that time and effort we spent helping Tolkien and this is the thanks we get?! Sir, we would ''love'' to sign your wife. Jesus, we made it just in time!  Oh crap! Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well- Aw, just forget it!  Goddamnit! Goddamnit! Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show? Hey, is your show as good as America Idol? Let's do it Wing! Oh my God, dude! What? Get out! Woohoo! Yeah! What do you mean? We thought she was with you. Wing? Wing? They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again! Damn, CAA is pretty impressive. You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?! You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!  Dude, maybe we should give up! Cartman!  Wing?  Stupid talent agents!  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you! They killed Kenny! She had a contract with us first! ''We'' own her! Her life belongs to us! Yeah. Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling. Me too.  Tolkien?
