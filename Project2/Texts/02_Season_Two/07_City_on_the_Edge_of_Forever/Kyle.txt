Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway! Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there. I know, but, it's really snowy today. Oh, she would, dude. She would. Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck! I'm scared! Yeah, what are we supposed to do? 'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches! I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.' We couldn't get trapped here ''forever'', Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. What? Worse than this? You can say that again. Nope. Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny. Don't do it, kid. Holy crap, dude! On Wednesday or Thursday? Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus. Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt.  Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned. Now, that's what ''I'' call a sticky situation. Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us! What was ''what?'' What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against. Hey yeah, I remember that. Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? You bastard! We've just gotta stick together. Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too? What are we gonna do? There.  I think we got it. Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does. Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own? Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on ''it''.  Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! Wait a minute. I though your father was your ''mother'' 'cause she had a penis. Oh no!  Hello? Really? Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream. Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
