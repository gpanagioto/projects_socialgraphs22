Uh, hey! Excuse me?!  Hey, uh, I'm not sure if you remember me. Bob White? I just want you to know I was always on your side. In fact, all of us Whites were really on your side.  So, look, uh, what are we supposed to do now? You know, I'm a follower of QAnon. What are we supposed to do to stop the vaccinations? They're vaccinating people right now, seeding people with their microchips! Surely, you have a plan?! We're on the internet every night waiting for word. Did you hear that, honey? He said 'shit... out your dickhole'... He's trying to give us some kind of signal. My friends, these are very dangerous times. Our country's future is at a precipice. And that is why I have called together every QAnon follower in our town. They didn't win! We just recently received a new coded message. Not from Q... From the chosen one.  Blow shit out dick hole - BSDH. We all know what BS is, but DH? It didn't make sense. Until my wife reminded me that DH are the initials of David Harris, the anon from Akron, Ohio who said that the elite use Latin to send coded messages. Out your dick hole -- Anno Yanis Domini Homme. Do what he does. The chosen is teaching now. He's taking Q's message straight to the children. And he wants us to do the same. There's an incredible shortage of teachers right now. He's trying to tell us that this is our time to strike! The elite want to fuck with our kids? We'll fuck theirs!  Forget all the Zooms and masks and social distancing at school.  Let Tutornon save your child. Literally!
