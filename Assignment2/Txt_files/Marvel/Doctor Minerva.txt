During the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline, Doctor Minerva hires a group of human soldiers to assault a medical facility to steal a [[Inhumans|Terrigenesis cocoon]] containing an infant Inhuman. As they escape, Minerva is attacked by [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] and the fight also draws [[Spider-Man]]'s attention. As the two superheroes work together to fight her, Minerva reveals her plan of using the genetic material from Terrigenesis cocoons to create a new breed of Kree Super-Soldiers and shows the early results of her work by transforming into a giant creature to attack the heroes.<ref name="ReferenceA">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #7.

Doctor Minerva returned to Earth during the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline.
