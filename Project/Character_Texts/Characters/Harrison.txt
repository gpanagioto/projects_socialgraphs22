Everyone calm down, please. We have to have civil order. Listen to me. Now I know everyone's scared, but we have to keep control. Yes all of our emails and Internet histories are about to become public knowledge.  But, but, we all need to understand that TrollTrace will never happen if people don't log on to use it. The website is a massive database that cross-references everything ever said on the Internet. It relies on people typing in a name and address of someone else  then our town won't suffer the same fate as Fort Collins. And that's why we have to come together as a community, and resist any temptation to use TrollTrace,  This hack of our city will never happen, so long as we rely on the rationality and the basic decency of the American people. Guess I could've worded that differently. Maggie.
