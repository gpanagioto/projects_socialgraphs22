But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win! This is bullcrap, dude! Dude, I really don't care.   Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot? I'm not voting! I just think this whole thing is stupid!  It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point. Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care. Puff Daddy? I... "Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?! Aaaah! ...Okay. I'll vote. I guess...  Okay.  I'm voting. Yeah, I know.  I thought I was supposed to make my own decision. Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for ''your guy''! Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it! The whole thing is a joke! B-bani-banishment? You-you're all joking, right? I'm not voting!  Dad, isn't this a little extreme? Hello?  Oh, thank God. Awww! What about me? I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it. Wow, you guys really love animals. I'll live with you. He said I can stay. Ahh, no thanks, that's okay. I ''do'' love animals, just ...not like you guys do. I can't. I was banished for not voting. I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. I guess... I guess you're right.   Aaah!  I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have. Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
