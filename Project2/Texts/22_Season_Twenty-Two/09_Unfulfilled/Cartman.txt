Bike parade? That's so dumb. What are you doing? Don't lie, Kenny! You saw that Larry kid scoring chicks with his bike, heard about the cash prize, and you decided to do the bike parade behind our backs! I know 'cause I thought the same thing!  Jesus. Is this really what it's come down to, you guys? Whatever happened to *us*? It used to always be the four of us. Always. Now Stan's moved to a farm. I have anxiety. Kenny? Nobody really talks to Kenny. And then there's just... Kyle. We used to do everything together. What if we did this like the old days? If we order everything online, we can have it delivered tomorrow!  We need props, pyrotechnics, the works! Kenny, get on your mom's laptop and start ordering streamers, sparklers and rockets! Make sure everyone ships Next Day Delivery! This is gonna be just like the old times, you guys! My stuff's here!  Shut up!  Mom, were there a bunch of packages for me? I guess it's time to face it. We aren't going to get our stuff. At the... the ma-, the ma-ma-, the mall. Guess we haven't been to the mall in a while.    The changing faces of immigrants in America as told through bicycles. This is a waste of time, you guys.
