Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore! Told ya. Yeah, we got it. Yeah, me neither. Not really. Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus! I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner. Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend. Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there.  Pretty good, I guess. Kenny ate all the mints, dad. Oh. Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  Huh? W-we really didn't ''see'' it that way. Y-yeah, butâ€¦ the color of someone's skin doesn't matter. Yeah.  Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan? No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
