Hello there, children. How's it going? Why bad? <poem><i>With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,</i></poem> <poem><i>Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...</i></poem> What were we talking about again? Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! We've got to do something, children! Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you! Not you, dammit! Ooh crap. Oh ooh. ''[In the ring.] ''Ah-ah-ah I ''can't''. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never ''speak'' to me again. Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright? Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?! Yup! Here's your present, children. Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later. I know, but the fight is starting. Mmmmm. That's ''my'' favorite ''kind'' of chili. Come on, children! We can ''still'' catch the end of the fight! Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
