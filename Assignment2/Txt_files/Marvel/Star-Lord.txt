==Publication history==
The character first appeared in the black-and-white magazine publication ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan 1976). Creator [[Steve Englehart]] had plans for the character that went unrealized. He later reflected on his website:

{{blockquote|I conceived something very large. My hero would go from being an unpleasant, introverted jerk to the most cosmic being in the universe, and I would tie it into my then-new interest in [[astrology]]. After his earthbound beginning, his mind would be opened step by step, with a fast-action story on Mercury, a love story on Venus, a war story on Mars, and so on out to the edge of the solar system, and then beyond.

But{{emdash}}after his earthbound beginning, where I established him as an unpleasant, introverted jerk, I left Marvel, so no one ever saw what he was to become.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Star-Lord.html |title=Star-Lord |first=Steve |last=Englehart |author-link=Steve Englehart |date=n.d. |website=SteveEnglehart.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016185220/http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Star-Lord.html |archive-date=October 16, 2014 |url-status=live |access-date=December 26, 2010}}</ref>}}

Star-Lord continued to appear in ''Marvel Preview'', with writer [[Chris Claremont]] revamping the character and using science fiction adventure stories like the [[Heinlein juveniles]] for inspiration.<ref name="MP11">{{cite comic |writer=[[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]] |penciller=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] |inker=[[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]] |story=Star-Lord |title=[[Marvel Preview]] |issue=11 |date=Summer 1977}}</ref> Heinlein's lawyers threatened legal action over the cover to ''Marvel Preview'' #11, which featured a blurb that described the content as "a novel-length science fiction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A.

The character returned in ''[[Thanos]]'' #8–12 (May–Sept. 2004) and ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (2006). The following year, he received a four issue eponymous title (''Annihilation: Conquest{{spaced ndash}}Star-Lord'') leading into the "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]" crossover storyline, in which he played a central role. Spinning out of "Annihilation: Conquest", a second volume of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' featured a team of characters from the crossover who were led by Star-Lord for the duration of the title's 25-issue run. Plot lines from that series were concluded in ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' mini-series.

Because of revisions to the character's origin, his early appearances have been officially designated as occurring in an alternate reality.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/master/earthteaz.htm#numbered |title=Numbered Realities |first=Jeff |last=Jeff Christiansen |date=n.d. |website=Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921061903/http://www.marvunapp.com/master/earthteaz.htm |archive-date=September 21, 2016 |url-status=live |quote=Earth-791 Star-Lord (Peter Quill) sired by Jason of Sparta, given Star-Lord identity and weaponry by Master of the Sun.

During publication of "Secret Wars", Marvel premiered a new ongoing ''Star-Lord'' series, written by [[Sam Humphries]], as part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] initiative, which focused on the character's [[retcon|revamped]] origins.

In April 2019 Peter Quill was given a 12 issue miniseries set in the [[Old Man Logan]] Universe called ''Old Man Quill'', which was written by Ethan Sacks and drawn by Robert Gill.<ref name="OldManQuill">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/old-man-quill-explained/|title = Old Man Quill: What Happened to the Guardian of the Galaxy?|date = July 5, 2019}}</ref>

In November 2020, Peter Quill acquires the title and powers of Master of the Sun (which he had in his early original first appearance in the ''Marvel Premiere'' series of the 1970s and later retconned to be his Earth-791 counterpart<ref name="MP11" /><ref name=":0" />) and it is revealed that the title was bestowed upon Peter by what and whom he believed to be a false memory from prior history, never truly lived. Being gifted entirely alien capabilities by said facsimile of his old mentor, Quill would gain incredible; albeit unexplored, new power which he can channel through his Element Gun. These as of yet unexplored faculties often manifest by the glow of his regrown left eye and the odd sun imprint tattooed to the palm of his right hand.<ref name=":1">{{cite comic |writer=Ewing, Al |penciller=Cabal, Juan |inker=Cabal, Juan |title=Guardians of the Galaxy |volume=6 |issue=9 |date=February 2021}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
When J'son's ship crash lands in Colorado, he is taken in by [[Meredith Quill]]. The two form a relationship while J'son makes repairs to his ship. Eventually, J'son is forced to leave to return home and fight in a war. He leaves, not knowing Meredith is pregnant with Peter Quill. Ten years later, Meredith is killed when she is attacked by two [[Badoon]] soldiers who have come to kill Peter and end J'son's blood line. Peter finds his father's gun by accident, kills them with a shotgun, and escapes his home before it is destroyed by the Badoon ship. The Badoon presume Peter has been killed and leave. Peter is placed in an orphanage and eventually joins [[NASA]].<ref name="GotGPointOne" /> It was eventually explained that he was raised by his mother's best friend Lisa Chang who was a commander at NASA.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Humphries, Sam |penciller=Garron, Javier |inker=Garron, Javier |story=Year One, Chapter One: Free Falling |title=Star-Lord |issue=1 |date=January 2016}}</ref>

Later, when his ship malfunctions and he is stranded in space, Peter is found by the Ravagers, a group of space pirates led by [[Yondu#Earth 616|Yondu]]. After the Ravagers save Peter, he tries to steal their ship. He outsmarts the Ravagers and even knocks out Yondu before capturing him. After Yondu awakens, he frees himself and attacks Peter, letting Peter choose to be released to space without more trouble or be killed. Peter instead asks Yondu if he could join Yondu's crew. Yondu eventually learns that the two share something in common: growing up as "kids without homes". Yondu lets Peter stay in the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy. Peter decides to stay and try to learn everything he can while among the Ravagers.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Humphries, Sam |penciller=Garron, Javier |inker=Garron, Javier |story=Year One, Chapter Two: Space Pirates Of The Galaxy |title=Star-Lord |issue=2 |date=February 2016}}</ref>

Peter encounters  [[the Fallen One]], a former [[Herald of Galactus]], and is almost killed defeating the entity. In addition, his vessel, ''Ship'', is destroyed in the conflict.

===The Black Vortex===
Peter and Kitty were successful in stealing the artifact called [[The Black Vortex]], but found themselves outnumbered by J'son's killing squad so they decided to call the X-Men and the remaining Guardians for help. Knowing the artifact could give them the needed power to defeat J'son, Peter wanted everyone to submit to the Vortex to gain cosmic powers. Kitty stood against the idea but some of their friends submitted anyway. After failing to stop them, the submitted cosmic warriors attacked Hala and Peter went with a team to help the Kree in the battle. After some failed negotiations for the Vortex his team had to escape, but J'son found them and destroyed Hala in retaliation. Peter escaped on time. After finding Spartax had been completely covered in amber by Thane, including Kitty, Peter lamented not having heard her since the beginning and apologize to her. Kitty escaped thanks to her phasing powers and both had a reunion. Seeing no other way to defeat J'son and his cosmic empowered team, Peter tried to submit to the Vortex but after seeing the power would eventually make him push Kitty away, he refused. Kitty ended up submitting and saving Spartax. After the war ended, Peter had a romantic talk with Kitty where he proposes to Kitty Pryde, a proposal which she accepts.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Sam Humphries|Humphries, Sam]] |penciller=[[Javier Garrón|Garrón, Javier]]; [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] |inker=[[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]]; Garrón, Javier; McGuinness, Ed |story=The Black Vortex Chapter 13 |title=Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: The Black Vortex Omega |issue=1 |date=June 2015}}</ref>

Star-Lord ends up in the domain of [[Manhattan]], where he gets a job singing in the popular club, "the Quiet Room", singing [[Disney]] songs, as Disney films never existed in [[Battleworld]], using the alias of Steve Rogers to hide from Doom. It is here that he runs into an alternate universe version of Kitty Pryde (from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] universe), who is hunting down artifacts from before Battleworld's creation. Hoping to talk to who he believes is his fiancée, he accidentally foils a deal between Kitty and [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] to obtain an ancient artifact.

===Grounded===
Living alone in an apartment given to him by [[Abigail Brand]], Peter calls [[Howard the Duck]] to try and have drinks with him, and Howard furiously hangs up. He then finds Kitty and [[Old Man Logan]] in an art gallery, where Kitty shouts at him for carrying his guns into an art gallery with children. Frustrated, Peter leaves. Logan then catches up to him and has drinks with him in a bar, where they fight hitmen, which attracts the attention of the police. Logan flees the scene and Peter is captured.

Peter is prosecuted by [[Matt Murdock]], who argues that unlike other superheroes, Star-Lord was reckless and endangered civilians while causing substantial property damage. The trial is interrupted by Brand, who gets the judge to reduce Peter's sentence to community service, to which Peter agrees. Brand and Alpha Flight then give him a new skin-tight costume, and he is assigned to senior citizen Edmund Allen, a retired super-criminal named Silver Bandit. After a day of bonding, Star-Lord is hired as a bartender at a bar for supervillains owned by Edmund's son.

===Master of the Sun===
When the reborn Olympians began wreaking havoc throughout the universe Richard Rider interrupted the Guardians' party and asked them for help to deal with the mad gods. However, Gamora refused wanting their family to live a normal happy life. Despite this Peter was unable to rest while innocent people were being killed, that and he had been having recurring visions of the Master of the Sun asking him if his life felt lacking as of late. Burdened with need of activity, he and Rocket joined Nova and other members of the Guardians to fight the Olympians. While Nova and Captain Marvel distracted some of the gods, Star Lord, Rocket, Marvel Boy, and Moondragon sneaked inside the Olympians' interdimensional ship intending to explode it. Unfortunately, they were discovered. After Star Lord was captured by Hephaestus, he killed the Olympian, and remained behind in order to detonate the bomb and defeat the Olympians, while the Guardians evacuated. The bomb successfully detonated destroying New Olympus, with Star Lord perishing as well.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Ewing, Al |penciller=Cabal, Juan |inker=Cabal, Juan |title=Guardians of the Galaxy |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=April 2020}}</ref>

It was later revealed that Quill had in fact not died and was transported to an entirely different universe after the Alt. continuum Kree Tech bomb exploded. He was taken in by a pair of travelers on this new world, Mors and Aradia, whom he eventually acquitted himself to both as friends as well as family and eventually lovers while spending more than one-hundred and eighty seven years running a gauntlet of escapades with them. He came to see that his Element Gun had changed significantly since when last he used it, initially the blaster had a finite charge on which elements he could churn out at which succession. But because he'd used it to siphon the divine energies of Olympus's pantheon. He found that use of the gun didn't seem to diminish its power supply. Whilst out camping with his new companions, Quill's fears, including an underlying suspicion as to why his personal keepsake never lost its juice were confirmed by the reappearance of the mad Olympians. Whom revealed the constant use of Peter's signature weapon that bound and drained their powers freed the petty gods from captivity with each usage of which and now they seek to reacquire their stolen might from him by any means necessary. Feeling responsible for bringing their wrath down upon their world, Quill opts to take a portal back to his universe in order to lead them away from his new home. In doing so he is met by the Master who states; having passed the test of his new life, he will make Quill into the one true Star Lord: The Master of the Sun.<ref name=":1" /> Arriving on Spartax in time to witness a symbiote dragon laying waste to his homeworld, Star Lord was caught up on all the events he'd missed and - with Nova's help - dove into the dragon and confronted the dark god of the symbiotes, Knull. Knull attempted to infect Star Lord and the other Guardians with living abyss to turn them into his soldiers, but Star Lord used the power he had obtained from the Olympians to kill the dragon and render its living abyss inert. Despite his new powers making him a powerful contender against Knull, Quill refused to return to Earth and face him - instead opting to prepare for the return of the Olympians.

==Powers and abilities==
Star-Lord is a master strategist and problem solver who is an expert in close-quarter combat, various human and alien firearms, and battle techniques. He has extensive knowledge of various alien customs, societies, and cultures, and considerable knowledge about cosmic abstracts, such as Oblivion.

As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. He uses an "Element Gun", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the [[Classical element|four elements]] (air, earth, fire and water). Star-Lord shares a [[psychic]] link with his [[Sentience|sentient]] space vessel, ''Ship''.

''Ship'' is a sentient energy form. She most often exists in the form of a starship but can alter her structure at will. She can travel through air, space and water. She possesses many of the conventional starship accessories, including shields, energy blasters, advanced sensors, replicators (able to form any kind of food, drink, etc.), and [[hologram projectors]]. She has proven capable of creating a human form, which she can then animate and use as a host. Even if completely destroyed, she is capable of restoring herself, since her true form is her consciousness. In addition, she takes on a number of feminine characteristics, such as a mothering instinct for those she is partnered with. She has felt deeper attachments, including love for her partners.

''Ship'' can create Widgets—small, mobile droids able to scout out situations, gather information, and then return to her. The full extent of ''Ship's'' abilities are unknown. During Star-Lord's battle with The Fallen One, his element gun, suit and ''Ship'' were destroyed. Due to severe injury, he was grafted with cybernetic implants by doctors on the Kyln, where he was sentenced. The eye implant allows him to see all energy spectra and the memory chip in his brain gives him 100% total recall.

On the Kree world of Aladon Prime, Star-Lord's cybernetic implants were removed. Star-Lord was outfitted with a Kree-issued heat-dampening espionage battle-suit, which became the hallmark look for the Guardians of the Galaxy, a battle helmet, and a universal translator, all of which he still uses. His battle helmet can analyze strategy data, improve vision, and regulate oxygen in space. Star-Lord's chosen weapons are two Kree sub-machine guns with various types of ammunition, including explosives. After escaping the Cancerverse, Peter acquires a new element gun(s), but he discards his armor.

As Master of the Sun - while meditating on his new lease on life, Quill showed he could antigravitate off the ground in a sitting position while trying to focus his powers for the upcoming battle. Often when Quill finds his center of being and/or is utilizing his power through the magitek sidearm. Quill's body glows a bright voluminous radiance that causes Star-Lord's entire bodily coloration to glow bright golden, the light emitted is so powerful he can blow apart a Symbiote Dragon by channeling said force through the blaster. Star-Lord's transformation has seemingly rendered him immune to psionic intrusion. as Moondragon could not penetrate the luminal defenses his mind seemed to subconsciously throw up whenever she drifted towards him. The Element Blaster initially held a finite charge limit to its ability to channel and redistribute energy towards manipulating natural materials, but after having gained total control over various metaphysical dynamics pertaining to the universe, Quill now acts as his own dynamo to power said weapon of choice. Quill has recently picked up new tricks, such as having a recall ability which guides his pistol back to his hand once he calls for it.
