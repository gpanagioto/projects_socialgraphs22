Thanks, Stan. Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then. What's going on? Over here. This looks like an office. I can't get a dial tone.  They must be negotiating. Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on!   Where are you going, Stan? Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.
