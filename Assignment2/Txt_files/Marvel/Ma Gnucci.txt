==Fictional character biography==
===Welcome Back, Frank===
When the [[Punisher]] resumes his war on crime in New York City, he announces his return by killing the three sons of Isabella "Ma" Gnucci, the head of New York's largest remaining Mafia family.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = Welcome Back, Frank|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #1|date = April 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Ma uses her influence and connections to have the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] create a "Punisher Task Force" (which, unbeknownst to Ma, is a [[sinecure]] consisting of only two people) while also having her [[consigliere]] hire three assassins to eliminate Punisher, who kills them, and then kills the consigliere.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = Badaboom, Badabing|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #2|date = May 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> The Punisher follows this up by murdering Ma's brother and underboss Dino with a sniper rifle.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = The Devil by the Horns|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #3|date = June 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

While tracking Ma and her bodyguards, the Punisher is spotted and chased into the [[Central Park Zoo]], where he releases the captive animals as a distraction. Ma loses her scalp and all four of her limbs to a group of [[polar bear]]s, but survives.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada|story = Wild Kingdom|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #4|date = July 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author = Peter Sanderson|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City|url = http://books.simonandschuster.ca/The-Marvel-Comics-Guide-to-New-York-City/Peter-Sanderson/9781416531418|accessdate = 29 May 2015|year = 2007|publisher = [[Simon & Schuster|Gallery Books]]|isbn = 978-1416531418|page = 113}}</ref> Ten days after being mauled, Ma offers a reward of ten million dollars to anyone who can kill the Punisher.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada|story = Even Worse Things|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #5|date = August 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> This leads to one of the Punisher's neighbors tipping Ma off to the vigilante's whereabouts, which prompts Ma to send the entire Gnucci family to kill him. The Punisher guns down the mobsters, but sustains injuries during the battle that leave him temporarily incapacitated.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada|story = Spit out of Luck|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #6|date = September 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada|story = Bring Out Your Dead|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #7|date = October 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> With the Punisher weakened, Ma hires the [[Russian (comics)|Russian]], a near-superhuman mercenary, to finish him off.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada and Nanci Dakesian|story = Desperate Measures|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #8|date = November 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Nanci Dakesian|story = Fяom Яussia With Love|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #9|date = December 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Nanci Dakesian|story = Glutton for Punishment|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #10|date = January 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

The Punisher slays the Russian, drives to Ma's mansion, and intimidates her few remaining men into surrendering by showing them the Russian's severed head.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Stuart Moore and Nanci Dakesian|story = Any Which Way You Can|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #11|date = February 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> The Punisher then sets Ma's mansion ablaze while she helplessly screams insults at him. As fire consumes the building, Ma throws herself out a window, and tries to attack the Punisher by gnawing on his leg. The Punisher simply punts Ma back into her blazing home, where she is immolated.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Stuart Moore and Nanci Dakesian|story = Go Frank Go|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #12|date = March 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author = Robert G.

===Legacy===
Peter, Ma's nephew and the last living Gnucci, learns that he stands to inherit his aunt's fortune, but only in the event of the Punisher's death. To that end, Peter hires [[Deadpool]] to kill the Punisher; when the Punisher is falsely assumed to be dead, Peter receives his [[cheque]], which he loses in traffic. While Peter is chasing the cheque, he realizes that he can ask the bank for a new one, only to then be instantly killed when a truck knocks him onto the horns of the ''[[Charging Bull]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Buddy Scalera and Jimmy Palmiotti|penciller = Georges Jeanty|inker = Jon Holdredge|colorist = Tom Chu|letterer = Dave Sharpe|editor = Mike Marts|story = End of the Road, Part 1|title = Deadpool|volume = 2|issue = #54|date = July 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Buddy Scalera and Jimmy Palmiotti|penciller = Georges Jeanty|inker = Jon Holdredge|colorist = Tom Chu|letterer = Dave Sharpe|editor = Mike Marts|story = End of the Road, Part: 2|title = Deadpool|volume = 2|issue = #55|date = August 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Ma Gnucci reappears nine years after her death, claiming to have escaped from Hell itself with the intention of uniting the entirety of New York's underworld against the Punisher.<ref>{{cite book|author = Staci Strobl and Nickie D.
