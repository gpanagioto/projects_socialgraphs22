Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes. , you can feed them fishsticks. Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania. Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world.  Back to you, Tom. Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets.
