An elderly crime boss affiliated with the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], he is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], and a competitor to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''Spider-Man'' #70 (July 1996), and was created by [[Howard Mackie]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]

==Fictional character biography==
When the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] (Wilson Fisk) was absent from New York for a long period of time, Fortunato stepped into the power vacuum by using his ties with [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], forcing the other crime lords, such as the [[Slug (comics)|Slug]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], into accepting him.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #73</ref> His elder son [[Jimmy-6|Giachomo "Jimmy-6" Fortunato]] is present at the meeting where Fortunato portrays his power. The Don brings out [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to be executed. Then he brings out random civilians from each of the crime lord's territories. The plan is to have each crime lord kill a civilian, showcasing how Fortunato would punish disobedience by civilian massacres.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #74</ref>

The horrified Jimmy-6 pulls a gun on his father in front of the crowd of people. The spectators do not intervene, wishing to see how Fortunato would handle this, but the second Spider-Man intervenes and is soon joined by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. The innocent civilians are freed but they and the heroes are cornered, pursued by various members of the meeting. Jimmy-6 shows up in an attack helicopter, killing the pursuers and rescuing the civilians and the superheroes. Jimmy eventually reconciles with his father, but extends his debt to [[Ben Reilly]] to [[Peter Parker]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #255</ref>

Fortunato's dominance was eventually shattered when the Kingpin returned, launching a massed simultaneous attack on New York's crime lords and taking command during the confusion. [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] attacks Fortunato on the Kingpin's orders, leaving him comatose. Jimmy-6 was seen leading his organization for several months afterward. Later, the elderly Fortunato re-emerged and bought the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] at an auction for his awkward younger son Angelo Fortunato who attempts to kill the original Spider-Man, but the Venom symbiote rejects Angelo as unworthy and allowed to fall to death.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #8</ref> It was also confirmed that Jimmy-6 had somehow made peace with his father, as Fortunato briefly referred to as "My Beautiful Giacomo", showing no signs of ill will.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #7</ref>
