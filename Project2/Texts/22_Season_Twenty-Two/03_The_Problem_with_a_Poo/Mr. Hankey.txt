Hooooowwwdy ho! You wanted to see me? Better hurry. We only have two months before Christmas. What? But I can barely make a good Christmas show with what I have! Offensive? What about me is offensive? Yuh... you people can't do this. Christmas is the most magical time of the year. Okay, stop. Kids, the song's called "Deck The Halls," not "Let's All Suck Balls." Mow, come on, kids. Restoration Hardware put up their Christmas decorations two weeks ago, all right? Now listen: I didn't want this either. I wanted the Denver Symphony, but they cut my budget and I'm stuck with you. Now let's take it from the top!  Oh, Kyle! Hoowwwwdy ho!  Yeah.  Yeah. It was a bad attempt at a joke. I'm sorry. Will you tell the kids I didn't mean it? The fact is, I couldn't sleep last night so I took some Ambien. Do you take that stuff? It turns your brain into oatmeal. Please, Kyle, tell the kids I didn't mean any harm. We've gotta focus on Christmas!  <poem><i>Christmas time. It's Christmas time. Christmas time. Yeah, it's Christmas time</i></poem>. Oh, I'm sooo sorry. I took Ambien two nights ago and I called the schoolkids homos. Oh-oh Jeez, did I say that? Listen, if you're tired and you can't sleep, DO NOT take Ambien. Okay? Whew! Fire me? Nonono, please. I-I'm really sorry.  My civil rights are under attack. They can't just fire me from the Christmas show! The whole thing is my creation! It was a joke. Look at me! I don't even have a dick! Get it?  Okay, okay, look, I know: it wasn't a good joke. But it really wasn't my fault. The fact is, I went home last night and I was angry. I couldn't sleep, so I took some Ambien. And then I started tweeting. Ambien messes with my head. You ever take that crap? Well, I thought maybe I could get them in a defecation lawsuit.  Rrrgh! And I never ever would have said those things about the city council, but the Ambien makes me kind of blackout. Why not?  Rrrgh! And I just thought maybe we could convince the city council to hire me back. Oh, Kyle.  Howwwdy ho. Just tryin' to find some help. There isn't a lawyer in town who will take me. Wait a minute... You! You're the son of a lawyer. You have lawyer blood inside your veins! You can help me with my defecation lawsuit, Kyle! Please, Kyle. You're the only person left who can help me. You and me, pal, we are gonna fight the system! Y-es. That was a bad attempt at a Christmas joke. That's what I said: it was a bad attempt. You wanna hear a good Christmas joke? Sorry, I got the sniffles. All I understand is it's only eight weeks until Christmas! If we don't stop wasting our time, we're all gonna miss out on the most magical part of the whole year! Oh, come on! It was a joke! That's it! That's it, I've had enough of this whole fucking sham! Fuck all you and fuck this whole system! It's Christmastime!!  Gee whiz. Thanks for comin' out with me, Kyle.  So what's the plan, huh? What you got figured out to get my job back?  Oh, it was a joke, Kyle. Sometimes, when I take Ambien, I'm really groggy and moody the next day. It's a real side effect. It's printed right on the bottle. Kyle, don't you understand this whole thing is a smear campaign? Why are people focusing on a few stupid words I said when Christmas is just around the corner?! It's like everyone's forgot about what Christmas means!  Oh my God! Kyle, that's it! The holiday spirit! And that's the point! Don't you see? What we need to do is get everyone in the Christmas mood! We can bring the whole spirit of the holidays early! Nonono. Kyle, you gotta help me! I can't do this alone! You're all I have! Even my wife left with the Nuggets 'cause of all the pressure! Please! Well, maybe just a little if I really can't sleep. Yay! It's a deal! Oh boy, Kyle, I'm so excited! We're gonna bring the spirit of Christmas to South Park! Helloooo South Park! Come on, everybody! Get over here!  The PC what-Listen! Christmas season means peace on earth and good will towards men!  What?! What are they crying about now?! Well, then tell the babies to shut the fuck up!  Who the fuck brings a Goddamned baby to a Christmas show, anyway?! Lemme go, Kyle! These people are idiots!  Kyle, listen. It was 3 a.m. last night and I still hadn't slept, so I de-  Kyle? Kyle, please! They're gonna run me out of town, Kyle! They're going to erase me and everything I ever did. Kyle, we can all be shitty sometimes. Well, everyone, I guess this is goodbye. It sure has been swell. A Poober? They have that?  Oh, you mean Lyft. Well, okay. Goodbye, everyone. I hope I brought a few smiles and a few laughs into your hearts. Hoowwwwdy ho!
