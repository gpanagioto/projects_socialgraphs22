Well they're all eatin' together and praying. A-and they're puttin' syrup on their Mac & Cheese!  Uhn-un. Yeah, sorry. I can't listen to another one either.  What made Mr. Garrison do that? You really think Kyle would do that? Lion King II? No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT! She's not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it! Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something!  Jeez! Well I don't want a Canadian girlfriend, Eric! No! The one in the white shoes isn't that ugly. Okay!  Hi, my name's Butters, what's yours. Oh Charlotte, I've never done this before. You think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he's still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely begun. We'll run away together and ... and...? Here you go. What's "sore-y"? Oh. Heh, he-hey, heh that's neato.  What do you want?! No, we saw a movie and now we're goin' to the park. If I'm gonna be with this girl, I don't want her someday thinking it was all super-rushed! Yeah, just some work-related stuff.  Oh boy, yes I'd love to, here we go, oh God. Well uh, well yes, sir. W-wait, you don't wanna be here? Wuh well, you know, 'cause everything is great here, and we have cool stuff. But- so- then, why did you leave? Jeez, how bad can a president be? You don't got to be sore-y. It's me who should be sore-y. I think everyone has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte. I wasn't supposed to have time. I was supposed to give you a Hot Cosby, so our species could coexist. But now I realize you guys don't even wanna be here. There's really nowhere I'd rather be.  If it's okay with you, well I'd like to try a nice Slow Cosby instead. So do we. Charlotte! Ah, I should have done the Hot Cosby.
