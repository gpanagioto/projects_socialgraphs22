Sure, Kyle. Uh huh. Good. Sorry Kyle, I have to meet someone. Talk to your mother.   I don't know why you are harassing me. I don't even own a computer. Are you with the NSA or Homeland Security? A colleague? Dildo Shwaggins from Pussystores.org?! You're just a troll?!  Oh thank god! !  Why couldn't you just say, "I know who you are. I'm a troll too,"? Why do you have to be so fucking cryptic?! Look, I'm not really a troll, okay? I just started as a Yelp reviewer and got sick of how everyone's stupid comments sounded.  I just like messing with people 'cause it was funny. I got carried away! For what? It's not a way of life! I was just doing it for the LOLs. . .  I'm great! Totally good. Just sitting down and ... doing nothing. Is there a problem with that? Is there a problem with just wanting to sit and just ''be''? Is that illegal now? I'm totally happy. ''I'm happy''. I don't need to do anything to make me happy, fuck.  Ah! Ah ah, ah! No, no! I'm good. Get that away from me. No, sorry! I love it! I'm just swearing off electronics for a little bit.  No, I'm good! I don't need it! Nothing, Sheila. I'm fine.  I'm just trying to make some changes and less electronics is part of it. I'm sorry, Honey. Everything is okay. Promise.  Go! Go away! Go go!    What is this?! I, I don't even know what a member--. I don't even know what memberberries are. Yeah.   No, nothing! Got all caught up with work!  I'm going on a run!  Fuck you!  Yeah! Screw you, Skank! You fat little bitch! Go kill yourself, whore! Yeah, fuck you, bitch! Fuck you!   Oh, sorry, Hun! Sorry! Everything's fine, Kyle. Go back to bed. Nothing is going on! Okay, okay. I'm going to tell you the truth, Sheila. I watch porn on the Internet. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop. Oh yeah! But uh, it's uh, but this is different. Right! It's really embarrassing. It's... porn! It's... uh, piss! Porn! Piss porn!   No!  Oh no, no! It's not like that. No! I, I, I want you to! I just couldn't ask.  Yes? Yep!  So hot, I mean  It wasn't suppose to be like this. I just thought it was funny making people get wild up. It was just stupid-harmless-lock-room humor, till I made that lady kill herself.  Don't call me that here! Why can't you just go away?! No! Don't you get it?! I went "Protocol Zero"! I broke my phone, I delete all my email accounts so that nobody can trace me  ever again!  Can you please call me "Gerald"?!  Fffffuuuuuccckkk! This can't be happening.  Then it's over. I'm dead. I'm not necessarily Skankhunt42.
