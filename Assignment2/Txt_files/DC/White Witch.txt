The '''White Witch''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] character who appears in the stories published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by E. Nelson Bridwell and Curt Swan, she is usually depicted as a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th and 31st centuries. Her real name is '''Mysa Nal''', although her name was given as '''Xola Aq''' in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Legion stories in ''[[Adventure Comics]]''; the revelation that her name was actually Mysa Nal was a later [[retcon]]. She is the sister of fellow Legionnaire [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]] and daughter of former High Seer of Naltor Kiwa Nal. Like Dream Girl, she is a native of the planet Naltor, where nearly everyone has the power of [[precognition]], but unlike most Naltorians, Mysa cannot foresee the future.

==Fictional character biography==
To compensate for her inability to see the future, Mysa trained in the mystic arts on the planet [[Sorcerers' World|Zerox]], known as the 'Sorcerer's World', under the tutelage of five instructors (each having their own specialty - Air, Earth, Fire, Light and Water) and became an accomplished [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] instead. Mysa showed a remarkable aptitude for magic and easily excelled in her studies — much to the chagrin of the envious Mordru. Originally, she had red hair, but as she trained in magic, her hair and skin became chalk white and her eyes bright red. This change happened gradually after Dream Girl freed her from the "Hag" guise.

She first appeared in ''Adventure Comics'' #350 as the Hag, an apparently ancient magic user and an agent of the villainous [[Prince Evillo]]. When the Legion fought Evillo, two mysterious "new" members, "Sir Prize" and "Miss Terious" (actually [[Star Boy]] and Dream Girl) cast a spell that restored her to her true form. It was later revealed that this transformation had been worked by the villainous wizard [[Mordru]].

She joined the Legion after helping them defeat [[Darkseid]] in the famous Legion story, the [[Great Darkness Saga]]. Mysa proved herself a valuable member, often coming to member's aid with a handy spell or two. One feature that set the White Witch apart from the typical comic book sorcerer was a specific limitation on her spell-casting ability; she could only memorize a few spells at a time. Unlike characters like Dr. Fate, Mysa required study before casting a spell.

The White Witch played a prominent part in the so-called "Magic Wars", which concluded ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 3).

Some years later, after leaving the Legion, she married the presumedly-reformed Mordru and lived with him on the planet Tharn, which was, at that point, subdued and invaded by Mordru's magics. She was subjected to mystical imprisonment and manipulation during this period until the Legionnaires returned looking for her and their comrade Rond Vidar. Mysa was also a physical vessel for the disembodied soul of [[Amethyst (comics)|Amethyst]], one of the [[Lords of Order]] who is currently active in the present day DC Universe. It was this incarnation of the Legion's near defeat that led Mysa to take up arms against her husband, and she later rejoined the group. Right before ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', she was de-aged by Glorith to a teenager and appeared happy with the change. She assumed the codename Jewel and went underground with her fellow Legionnaires.

===Reboot version===
In post-''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' continuity, Mysa was no longer Dream Girl's sister from Naltor, but rather, the daughter of Mordru.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The only survivor of a group of sorcerers who imprisoned Mordru, she spent a century preparing for his return, including planting the seeds for [[Kinetix|Zoe Saugin]]'s powers and manipulating much of the girl's life to make her an ally against Mordru's next rise.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} After Mordru rose again, Mysa (who resembled the pre-''Zero Hour'' Hag at this point) was reverted to the age at which she first defeated him and helped the Legion imprison him once more.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Mysa settled on Sorcerer's World and fell in love with [[Dragonmage]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Threeboot version===
In the "[[Legion of Super-Heroes#"Threeboot" continuity (2004–2009)|Threeboot]]" continuity, White Witch has appeared as a member of [[Lightning Lord|Mekt Ranzz]]'s [[Wanderers (comics)|Wanderers]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Her home planet is listed as "unknown".

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
In ''[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' story arc, featuring a group of Legionnaires based on the original, pre-''Crisis'' incarnation, [[Spider Girl]] traded Mysa to [[Mordru]] in return for not attacking Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' #860</ref> At the conclusion of the story, [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]] comments to [[Superman]] that [[Dawnstar]] has a lock on Mysa's location, while [[Chameleon Girl]] assures [[Superman]] that the Legion will find their remaining lost teammates.<ref>''Action Comics'' #863</ref>

In the ''[[Legion of Three Worlds]]'' limited series, the White Witch is imprisoned on Sorcerer's World by Mordru until she is freed by members of the Legion, including [[Blok (comics)|Blok]].<ref name="final2">''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #2</ref> It is revealed at this point that Blok and Mysa are in a relationship. Their escape, however, is thwarted by Mordru, and then [[Superboy-Prime]]'s [[Legion of Super-Villains]]. Mysa uses [[Dawnstar]]'s tracking ability to open a portal directly to Legion headquarters. Fellow Legionnaire, Green Lantern Rond Vidar, forces his teammates through the portal to prevent the LSV from following. Back at Legion headquarters, Mysa attempts another portal to rescue Rond but is too late as he is killed by Superboy-Prime.<ref name="final2"/>

Brainiac 5 then enlists the White Witch to cast a seance spell on an old Justice League space-time crystal ball to bring the "Reboot" and "Threeboot" Legions to aid in their battle against Superboy-Prime.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #3</ref>

In the midst of battle, "Reboot" Legionnaire [[Kinetix]], who possesses magic-based powers, is killed by Superboy-Prime while Mordru absorbs her life-force and all of her magical powers. Because her home reality was destroyed during the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Kinetix also possessed all of that universe's magic energies, now passed on to Mordru.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #4</ref> Mordru began using his vastly increased powers in the villains' favor and launches a brutal attack on Blok to draw out Mysa. She reluctantly attacks Mordru with one of his own dark spells that allows her to steal his life-force and magics in a bright blaze of light. Mysa re-emerges as the '''Black Witch''' with a black costume and hair, using her increased powers to defeat most of the villains single-handedly.<ref name="final5">''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #5</ref>

At the conclusion of the story, the Black Witch remains a member of the Legion. However, Blok senses great trouble with his love's transformation. His concern increases as she returns to Sorcerer's World and claims Mordru's throne, vowing a vigilance against evil.<ref name="final5"/>

Later, Blok again reaches the [[Sorcerers' World]], only to find the Black Witch sitting on a throne in front of several spellcasters imprisoned in the stone behind her. Poking out of the wall are the faces of [[Alan Scott]], the Green Lantern wizard [[List of Green Lanterns#Torquemada|Torquemada]], [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]], [[Zatanna]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Kid Devil]]. Later, both she and Blok cement their relationship, hoping to use Mordru's dark powers for the good of the planet.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mysa Nal was trained by the master magician Mordru. She is able to create and cast a variety of spells, creating a strong invincible force field, transmutation, absorbing magic, and creating massive teleportation portals, among other feats. The only drawback to her magic was her memory. Mysa could only commit to spells if she remembers them, plus the additional time-consuming preparation for their preparation, which could take up to hours.

==Equipment==
As a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] she is provided a Legion flight ring. It allows her to fly and protects her from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.

==In other media==
The White Witch appeared in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' episode "Trials", not as a Legionnaire but as an illusionary/holographic guide within an enchanted bracelet. She would direct the banished wizard Zyx in his attempt to regain his magic through certain trials. She was voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].

==Reception==
Jesse Murray of [[Syfy]] placed Mysa Nal as the 22nd greatest [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] member of all time, noting her relationship drama with a "big-baddie" of the superhero team [[Mordru]] and calling her moment of her absorbing his powers as the Black Witch as one of the defining moments for her.<ref name="Legion">{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Jesse |title=Every Member of the Legion of Super Heroes, Ranked: #49-1 |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/every-member-of-the-legion-of-super-heroes-ranked-49-1 |website=SYFY WIRE |access-date=3 April 2020 |language=en |date=12 January 2016}}</ref> Eileen Gonzalez of [[Comic Book Resources]] placed her as one of the "best" Legion superheroes out both a best and worst character list. Eileen noted her pivotal roles in "[[The Great Darkness Saga]]" with her role of stopping [[Darkseid]] and once again the role of "[[Final Crisis]]" stopping Mordru as defining moments as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gonzalez |first1=Eileen |title=The Legion Of Super-Heroes: The 10 Best Members (And 10 We Could Do Without) |url=https://www.cbr.com/legion-super-heroes-members/ |website=CBR |access-date=3 April 2020 |date=3 July 2018}}</ref> Caleb Bailey of [[Comic Book Resources]] placed her and her powers as "powerful magic user who could probably give [[Zatanna]] a run for her top hat".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bailey |first1=Caleb |title=10 Legion of Super-Heroes Members With Powers Nobody Understands, Finally Explained |url=https://www.cbr.com/legion-of-super-heroes-strangest-powers-abilities-explained/ |website=CBR |access-date=3 April 2020 |date=9 September 2019}}</ref>
