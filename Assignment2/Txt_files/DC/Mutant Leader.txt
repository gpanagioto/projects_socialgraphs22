The '''Mutants''' is the name of a fictional street [[gang]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. While the Mutants were first seen in ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', there were other incarnations of the Mutants that appeared in later [[Batman]] comics.

==Fictional team biography==
===The Dark Knight Returns===
In the pages of ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', the Mutants are a youth gang that was formed sometime after Bruce Wayne retired as Batman. When the Mutants cause trouble in Gotham City at the time when crime is at an all-time high, Bruce Wayne becomes Batman again. Following his fight with [[Two-Face]], Batman fights the Mutants. Although Batman defeats the Mutants with his advanced weaponry in the ensuing battle, the Mutant Leader ends up goading him into a fight. During their hand-to-hand brawl, Batman, despite being able to match the Leader in strength, is rusty and slightly slow due to a decade's lack of activity which results in him getting seriously injured. [[Carrie Kelley]] creates a diversion, allowing Batman to immobilize the Mutant Leader, and the two of them escape. The [[Gotham City Police Department]] arrive and arrest the Mutant Leader and those with him. While in police custody, the Mutant Leader is visited by the unnamed [[List of mayors of Gotham City|Mayor of Gotham City]] who wants to negotiate with him. This ends with the Mutant Leader killing the mayor by tearing out his throat causing Deputy Mayor Stevenson to be sworn in as the new Mayor of Gotham City. Assisting in Batman's plan, Gordon has the Mutant Leader released while Carrie spreads the word of a showdown between Batman and the Mutant Leader. The two engage in a fight at a sewage run-off pipe surrounded by members of the Mutant gang. Leveraging the mud from the sewage to slow him down, Batman deals the Leader a brutal defeat. Seeing Batman defeat their leader, the Mutants disband and some of them come together as a group called the Sons of Batman, using excessive violence against criminals.<ref>''The Dark Knight Returns'' #1-2.
