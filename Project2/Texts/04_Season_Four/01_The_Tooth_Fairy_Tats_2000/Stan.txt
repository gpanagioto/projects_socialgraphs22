What the hell's wrong with Cartman?! Two dollars! For one tooth? Dude, every time ''I'' lost a tooth I only got a quarter. I already lost all my baby teeth. Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there? What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's. Uh, Butters, could we have it? Yeah, we just have to get ''Butters''' tooth. I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.  Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there? Well? Oh my God! Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under ''your pillow''.   Dude, where's the money? What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega! Tell us what?! Dude.  You guys! You guys! I figured it out! Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast! Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right? So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it! The kid will never even know. We can take the bus to the city. There's ''super''-rich people down there!  Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."  There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it. This is the smartest business venture ever.  Hey, what the hell are ''you'' guys doing?! ...Hey, you can't do that! Because that's what ''we're'' doing! ''You'' scram! We were here first! ''You'' woke him up!  Who's the Boss? Uuh, yeah. Damnit! And we thought we were so original! Well, uh-what do you mean? What's a "tooth trade?" Amazing. Oh. Uh-I don't know. How much do we get if we work for you? We're in! We all want double-desserts today! U-uh, Chef. Chef! CHEF! We're not dealing drugs! No! Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules! We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses. Dude, just stop thinking about it.  Kyle?  Aw, shit. What? Really? So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
