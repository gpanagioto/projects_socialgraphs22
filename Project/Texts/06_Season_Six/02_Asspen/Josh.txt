You folks enjoying the condo? Well, best to do it and get it out of the way. That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity! Wow!  Time share. Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little place in Aspen." It's downright smart! It's nice to feel rich, isn't it. And then share it with the people that come tomorrow. They got the red sticker?! Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes. We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about! And we certainly don't want to pressure you. I know! Have you ever considered going ''in'' on a time share? That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!  "What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"
