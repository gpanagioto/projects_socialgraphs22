'''Zatanna Zatara''' ({{IPAc-en|z|ə|ˈ|t|æ|n|ə|_|z|ə|ˈ|t|ɑr|ə}}) is a [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Murphy Anderson]], and first appeared in ''[[Hawkman (comic book)|Hawkman]]'' #4 (November 1964).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=338}}</ref> Zatanna is a stage magician with actual mystic powers much like her father, [[Zatara]], granting her magical powers notably controlled by invoking commands speaking incantations backwards. Her powers originate from her [[homo magi]] heritage, an off-shoot of humanity capable of naturally manipulating magic energies. She is known for her involvement with both the [[Justice League]] and [[Justice League Dark]], having served as a leadership figure for both teams.

Zatanna has appeared in several different media adaptations, including appearing in several television series in the [[DC Animated Universe]], notably voiced by [[Julie Brown]] and [[Jennifer Hale]]. She has also appeared as a recurring character in the final three seasons of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', portrayed by actress [[Serinda Swan]]. A younger version of the character also appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' series, voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Murphy Anderson]], Zatanna first appeared in ''[[Hawkman (comic book)|Hawkman]]'' #4 (November 1964). When she is introduced, she is on a quest to find her father [[Zatara]] who made his first appearance in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] but had not been published regularly for several years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1960-64 |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490458 |page=173}}</ref> The storyline crossed multiple comics published by DC at the time, culminating in issues of ''[[Justice League of America]]'', also written by Fox.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-''Crisis''===
Zatanna is the daughter of magician [[Zatara|Giovanni "John" Zatara]] who appeared in Golden Age comic books and Sindella, a member of the mystical species ''Homo magi''. Her younger cousin, the teenager [[Zachary Zatara]], is also a magician in the DCU. Zatanna makes her living as a stage illusionist prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Her original costume is based upon her father's costume but substituting fishnet stockings and high heels for slacks. Zatanna's search for her father was the subject of a storyline<ref name="Markstein">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/zatanna.htm |title=Zatanna the Magician |first=Don |last=Markstein |year=2006 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6RRePKflh?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/zatanna.htm |archive-date=July 30, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> which was featured in several titles edited by [[Julius Schwartz]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=McAvennie|first1=Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah|chapter= 1960s|title= DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 112|quote= Her first appearance, presented by scribe Gardner Fox and artist Murphy Anderson, ultimately conjured up the era of the crossover, and emphasized the effectiveness of continuity in comics.

At the conclusion of [[Alan Moore]]'s [[Swamp Thing]] "American Gothic" storyline<ref>Chronicled in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #35-50 (April 1985-July 1986).</ref> (which was tied to the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), [[John Constantine]] comes to get Zatanna, [[Mento (comics)|Mento]] and [[Sargon the Sorcerer]] to come together to help demonic and divine forces in other hellish dimensions battle the entity known as the 'Great Evil Beast'. The séance is held at Wintersgate Manor, the home of [[Baron Winters]] in Georgetown, Washington D.C., which is also a temporal threshold to other planes of reality. Because Constantine had previously taken Zatanna to a "[[Neotantra|tantric]] studies meeting", Zatara will ''not'' let Zatanna out of his sight with Constantine present and, by his very presence, is forced to take part in the [[seance]] to which he was ''not'' invited. The Beast, which is so tall that its thumb alone looms over Hell, takes notice of their group twice. The first glimpse dooms Sargon, whom Zatara convinces to 'die like a sorcerer' and not break the holding of hands. Sargon burns to death nobly. The second glimpse starts to literally heat up Zatanna. Zatara willingly takes the effect onto himself, dying (his smoldering hat lands on the table), but sparing his daughter's life.<ref>''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #49-50 (June–July 1986)</ref>

===Post-''Crisis''===
Zatanna starred in a special solo one-shot in 1987 that featured Zatanna exploring her mother Sindella's background and battling the villainous sorceress Allura.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]|penciller= [[Gray Morrow|Morrow, Gray]]|inker= Morrow, Gray|story=Zatanna Special|title= Zatanna|issue= #1|date=1987}}</ref> In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' limited series, Zatanna becomes friends and even temporary guardian to [[Timothy Hunter]], a boy destined to become the greatest wizard in the world,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]]|penciller= [[Scott Hampton|Hampton, Scott]]|inker= Hampton, Scott|story= The Shadow World|title= [[The Books of Magic]]|issue= #2|date=1990}}</ref> and his girlfriend Molly who at the time was cursed by the Queen of the Fairies and unable to touch anything in the human world, including the ground. After a brief stay, she sent Molly home and Tim wandered off on his own adventures. In 1993, Zatanna starred in her first solo limited series, titled ''Zatanna: Come Together'', which saw her summoning her mother's spirit and battling the sorcerer Tannarak and a demon called Xaos.

When the Justice League vanish in the past as they attempt to rescue the missing Aquaman, an emergency protocol set up by Batman assembles a new League, with this team including [[Jason Blood]] as its magical expert. However, when the current threat is identified as [[Gamemnae]], an ancient Atlantean sorceress who seeks to conquer the world, she uses a quagmire spell to absorb Zatanna and Tempest into herself. When new League leader Nightwing attempts to order Blood to transform into Etrigan to help them against Gamemnae, Blood insists that Zatanna is the one they need, sacrificing himself to Gamemnae's quagmire spell in order to free Zatanna. She subsequently joins Nightwing, Firestorm and Hawkgirl in travelling back to ancient Atlantis, where Aquaman has been trapped in a pool of water as a water wraith, Firestorm creating a channel between the pool and the sea before Zatanna casts a spell that allowed the water-based Aquaman to control the entire ocean as his body, allowing him to sink Atlantis in the past and present and disrupt Gamemnae's power.

Zatanna starred in another solo one-shot in 2003, ''Zatanna: Everyday Magic'', in which she fought Nimue Ravensong, a magic-user jealous of Zatanna's ability to use magic naturally and without committing sacrifices. Nimue seduced and cursed John Constantine, leading Zatanna into conflict with the wannabe sorceress.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Paul Dini|Dini, Paul]]|penciller= Mays, Rick|inker= Mays, Rick|story= Everyday Magic|title= Zatanna|issue= #1|date=2003}}</ref> In the 2004 limited series ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', Zatanna is a member of the Justice League at the time the villain [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] rapes the Elongated Man's wife, [[Sue Dibny]]. When apprehended, he threatens the JLA members' families. Although Zatanna is prepared to erase Light's memories of the incident as she had done to other villains with knowledge dangerous to the League, tampering with Light's mind sparks a debate among the team's members: should the villain's personality be transformed to prevent him from repeating his crime. Zatanna, Hawkman, and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)]] vote for such action, while [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], and Green Lantern vote against. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)]] breaks the tie. Zatanna mind-wipes Light, and the process results in his intellectual abilities being lowered.<ref>Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 313: "The Justice League had...asked Zatanna to erase Light's memory and alter his mind".</ref> In the midst of the process, Batman appears and tries to stop it. Zatanna freezes him, and the members vote unanimously to erase Batman's memories of the incident as well.

Her working relationship to Batman sours after he discovers the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at one of [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s [[Lazarus Pit]]s, she asks him why he came to her and Batman says: "I needed someone I could trust. But I had to settle for you". After ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', their relationship appears to have warmed; in ''Detective Comics'' #824 he calls her for information on a card-counter involved in scamming the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]. He makes no mention of their conflict, and casually calls her by her nickname, "Zee".

[[Catwoman]] discovers that Zatanna's mind-wipe of Dr. Light in ''Identity Crisis'' is not an isolated occurrence; Catwoman's journey from villain to hero and her resulting efforts to lead a moral life are retconned as being the result of Zatanna's mental intervention. Catwoman comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident. In retaliation, Catwoman shoves Zatanna out a window. Zatanna parry the next attack from Catwoman and freeze her, before apologize and leaving her.

A 2005 four-issue ''Zatanna'' limited series was published as part of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' event.<ref>Cowsill "2000s" in Dolan, p. 319: "Grant Morrison's imagining of the ''Seven Soldiers of Victory'' was one of DC's most adventurous titles...The story started in ''Seven Soldiers of Victory'' #0 and continued in seven four-issue miniseries – ''The Bulleteer'', ''Frankenstein'', ''Mister Miracle'', ''Zatanna'', ''Shining Knight'', ''Manhattan Guardian'', and ''Klarion''".</ref> In it, at a [[support group]] for superheroes, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father's tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a shapeshifter named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], combined with her guilt from her former mind-wipes, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, [[Sheeda#Sheeda characters|Misty Kilgore]], she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a [[wiktionary:plague|plague]] to infect and degrade the entire universe. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written for her, his "greatest spell and gift to the world". In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda.

In ''Detective Comics'' #833 (August 2007), it is stated that Zatanna's father was a friend of [[Thomas Wayne]]. Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape, and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends, although Batman believes that he has never met her in ''Justice League of America'' #51, and her only memory of meeting him is while she was disguised. Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias. Loxias is revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman. Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker's scheme, driving Joker insane in the process. Bruce puts Zatanna's betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship.

On the "Roll Call" of ''Justice League of America'' #22 (August 2008), Zatanna is listed as a part of the team. Called upon to help with the [[Red Tornado]]'s restoration in his android form, she aids the League when they are attacked by a new, powerful iteration of [[Amazo]]. During the battle, Zatanna has her mouth magically removed with her spells, and once again uses her blood to write out spells and restore it.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dwayne McDuffie|McDuffie, Dwayne]]|penciller= [[Ed Benes|Benes, Ed]]|inker= Benes, Ed|story= The Second Coming Chapter Two: Things Fall Apart|title= Justice League of America|volume= 2|issue= #23|date= September 2008}}</ref> After that Wonder Woman throws off Amazo's concentration and free Zatanna.

In May 2010 Zatanna received her own solo series, written by [[Paul Dini]] and drawn by [[Stéphane Roux (comics)|Stéphane Roux]].

===''DC Rebirth''===
Zatanna makes her first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #958, assisting Bruce in taking out a robot chasing after a cult member. Later on, it is revealed Bruce would like to see her in hopes that she will teach him more about magic that would revive Tim Drake.

== Characterization ==
=== Heritage & ancestry ===
Prior to the [[The New 52|New 52]], the character was considered half human and half homo magi (sometimes referred to as Atlantean), in which the latter half was attributed to originating from her mother. In addition, the 1993 Zatanna mini-series heavily implied her ancestry to also include the demigod, [[Arion (character)|Arion]], the entity known as "Xaos" having conflated the two due to possessing similar magical "signatures" and later correcting himself.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mars |first=Lee |title=Zatanna #4 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |year=1993}}</ref> Through her father's family line, the character was considered a descendant of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and is related to [[Nostradamus]], Alessandro Cagliostro,  [[Nicholas Flamel]], and Evan Fulcanelli.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Fox |first=Gardner F. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54495465 |title=Justice League of America : Zatanna's search |date=2004 |publisher=DC Comics |others=Gerry Conway, Murphy Anderson, Carmine Infantino, Bob Kane, Gil Kane, Mike Sekowsky |isbn=1-4012-0188-1 |location=New York |oclc=54495465}}</ref> It is also through this line she is considered of both Italian<ref name=":2" /> and [[Romani people|Romani]] descent.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dini |first=Paul |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/664668568 |title=Batman, streets of Gotham.

Afte the events of Flashpoint and the New 52, it is mentioned that both Sindella and Giovonni Zatara are of the [[homo magi]] race.<ref name=":3" />

=== Relationships ===
In comics taking place in the mainstream continuity, Zatanna has had various relationships with other DC Characters, including [[John Constantine]] (with whom she practiced [[tantra]]) and [[Doctor Thirteen]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|penciller=[[Ryan Sook|Sook, Ryan]]|inker=Gray, Mick|story=Talking Backwards Sdrawkcab Gniklat|title=[[Seven Soldiers]]: Zatanna|issue=#1|date=June 2005}}</ref> Zatanna also had a flirtatious relationship with her fellow Justice Leaguer [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen / the Flash]] shortly after the death of his wife Iris.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Conway, Gerry|penciller=[[Don Heck|Heck, Don]]|inker=McLaughlin, Frank|story=Proteus Says: 'All Things Must Change!'|title=Justice League of America|issue=#187|date=February 1981}}</ref> In ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]'' timeline, Zatanna is romantically involved with [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood / Etrigan the Demon]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[J.

She has a strong friendship with Batman due to their shared (retconned) pasts. In ''Detective Comics'' #843-844, Zatanna and Bruce briefly discuss the possibility of having a more meaningful relationship. Both later concede that Bruce is too devoted to his cause as Batman to give her the relationship she wishes for, but the pair reaffirm their bond as close friends. Catwoman once considered Zatanna a more dangerous contender for Bruce's attentions than [[Jezebel Jet]], his fiancé at the time.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Dini, Paul|penciller=[[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Nguyen, Dustin]]|inker=Fridolfs, Derek|story=The Riddle Unanswered|title=Detective Comics|issue=#845|date=August 2008}}</ref> A pep talk between the two women confirms how Zatanna really meant, during the fateful discussion with Bruce, to explore the possibility of a true romance, but turned out quietly resigned to the role of best friend and confidant.

In mainstream media, [[DC Animated Universe]] touches on Bruce and Zatanna's closeness depicted as her having had a crush on him while he trained under her father as "John Smith", though she later found out his real name. Decades later, an elderly Bruce is shown to still care for her as he keeps a picture of her along with pictures of his other love interests in a file in the Batcomputer. In the TV series ''Young Justice'', Zatanna has a flirtatious and possibly romantic friendship with [[Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson / Robin]] during Season 1. Dick later says that they have a "history" in Season 2 (five years after Season 1), implying that they dated and eventually broke up but still remained close.

==Powers and abilities==
An expert magician with knowledge of an immeasurable number of spells, Zatanna is considered one of the most powerful magicians in the world of DC Universe; as a member of the Homo magi, she possess both the genetic ability to use magic and has mastery over both mystical and cosmic forces considered to be as old as the universe. Her prowess earned her the title of both "Mistress of Magic" and is also hailed as "Sorceress Supreme".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/213309017|title=The DC comics encyclopedia : the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe|date=2008|publisher=DK Pub|others=Scott Beatty, Daniel Wallace|isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1|edition=Updated and expanded|location=New York|oclc=213309017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Scott|url=https://www.amazon.com/DC-NATION-0-Scott-Snyder/dp/B07CN7G2ML|title=DC NATION #0|last2=Bendis|first2=Brian Michael|last3=King|first3=Tom|date=2018-01-01|publisher=DC Comics|edition=1st}}</ref> She is often depicted working alongside other, heroic peers considered among the most powerful magic-users on Earth such as [[Madame Xanadu]], [[John Constantine]], [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood/Etrigan]], [[Doctor Fate]], [[Sebastian Faust]], and [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]].

As tribute and a method to concentrate, Zatanna usually casts spells by speaking backwards (known as "Logomancy") for a variety of magical effects such as teleportation, healing, manipulate the mind of others, and more. Zatanna can also cast spells and other magics normally and by others means.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936192301|title=The DC comics encyclopedia: the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe|date=2016|others=Alan Cowsill, Alexander Irvine, Steven Korté, Matthew K.

Furthermore, her powers seems tied to her self-confidence, as the long series of blunders described in ''Seven Soldiers'' left her both emotionally and psychologically shattered, powerless, until she was able to restore her lost confidence.

In addition to her magical abilities, Zatanna is a skilled illusionist, showgirl and stage magician even without resorting to her innate magical powers. She considers part of her "training" exercising [[sleight of hand]] tricks, and she claims to have invented a variation of the [[three-card monte]] called the "Zatara shuffle", in which she is so fast and precise that, even without resorting to cheating, only skilled gamblers like Selina Kyle are able to follow the movements of her hands. Zatanna is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by her father during her childhood. She is highly trained in escape artistry, having learned how to get out of a straitjacket underwater in Kindergarten and between her magic show acts.

=== Mystical artifacts ===
As a sorceress, Zatanna also has access to various arcane object at her dispsal, many of them being the same collection of artifacts her father collected over the years:

* '''Talisman of Atlantis''': One of the various mystic artifacts she carried for a time during the character's redesign in the 1990s, appearing within her 1993 solo series. The artifact, a gift to from her mother in which was contained within her father's assorted artifacts allows her to utilize magic via concentration as opposed to backwards casting with added ease. It was also used in conjunction with a magical staff to focus her powers through.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mars |first=Lee |title=Zatanna #2 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1993}}</ref>
* '''Demonography''': A demonology book that details informations relating to demons.  Due to its magical properties, the book automatically updates itself with information (as seen when an entry of the demon Nebiros was updated to include a recent involvement with Blue Devil) with revised editions, the act done by an unforeseen group of entities.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Mishkin |first1=Dan |title=Blue Devil #4 |last2=Cohn |first2=Gary |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |year=1984}}</ref>

==Other versions==
===''DC Super Dictionary''===
The 1978 ''DC Super Dictionary'' invented a character, Conjura, who had the same magic ability as Zatanna, in addition to possessing a time-traveling amulet. While possessing similar powers, the character was visually distinct from Zatanna, depicting her as a dark-skinned woman in a purple jumpsuit, jackboots, and yellow turban with a long cape.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Mary Z. |title=The Super Dictionary |date=July 1978 |publisher=Holt McDougal |isbn=9780030437564 |page=44}}</ref>

===Earth-3===
* Annataz Arataz, Zatanna's evil [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]] counterpart, assists [[Superman-Prime]] to detain and torment [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]] in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' #23. The imp refuses to provide Prime with information, and Annataz restores his powers. Reflecting upon her own prior cruel actions, she allows herself to be killed by the enraged villain. Her spells are recited "upside-down", rather than backwards.
* Zatanna's evil Antimatter Earth counterpart, who unlike the Earth-3 counterpart is called Zatanna, is briefly mentioned in ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' #35, as one of the few survivors of a purge on magic users.

===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, Zatanna is merged with the [[Scarlet Witch]] of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to form a character known as Wanda Zatara, the White Witch.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Ron Marz|Marz, Ron]]|penciller= [[José Luis García-López|García-López, José Luis]]|inker= [[Kevin Nowlan|Nowlan, Kevin]]|story= The Decrees of Fate|title= Doctor Strangefate|issue= #1|date= April 1996}}</ref>

===''Batman: Holy Terror''===
In ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'', a world where [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Church never fell and the [[United States|United States of America]] (which now encompasses [[North America]] and most of [[South America]]) is ruled by a totalitarian religious group known as the Privy Council, Zatanna is an agent of the council. She uses her 'sin' in the service of the state to capture other superhumans, but she is defeated by Batman. While focusing on defeating [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], Batman throws a gas pellet down her throat.

===''JLA: Another Nail''===
She appears in ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', which shows her teaming with Hawkwoman in Midway City.

===''Flashpoint''===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Zatanna is a member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Seven]] and is a member of a motorcycle gang. Her father, Giovanni "John" Zatara, is transformed into a motorcycle when Zatanna is riding on him. Zatanna is killed while trying to cast a death spell on [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Blanco, Fernando|inker= Koblish, Scott|story= Part Two: Call of the Wild|title= Flashpoint: Secret Seven|issue= #2|date= September 2011}}</ref>

===''Smallville: Harbinger''===
Zatanna stars in the four-issue mini series, ''[[Smallville season 11|Smallville]]: Harbinger''. Looking for her father's ''Book of Magick'' in England, she meets John Constantine for the first time. They team up to rescue [[Raven (DC Comics)|Rachel Roth]] and retrieve the ''Book of Magick'' from [[Brother Blood]]. Similar to the TV show, her spells are spoken entirely backwards.

===''DC Bombshells''===
In the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity, Zatanna was the daughter of a Jewish father and a Romani mother during World War II, but was prevented from being sent to the concentration camps thanks to the Joker's Daughter, who in return, forced her to perform magic to aid the Third Reich. Her lover, John Constantine, confronted her during one of her shows in an attempt to rescue her, but knowing they were surrounded, Zatanna transformed John into a rabbit and kept him under her care to prevent his death. He eventually convinces her to use her magic to aid the Allies, which she does by transforming her soul into a large, spiritual dove that aids Batwoman in freeing a refugee camp. Their attempts are discovered by the Nazis, and the two are depowered of their magic (with John being turned back into a human) and sent into the ghettos. Zatanna slowly gains her powers back over time, and finds a kindred spirit in another magic user imprisoned by the Joker's Daughter, Raven. They eventually defeat and depower the Joker's Daughter after allying herself with the Bombshells.

===''Mystik U''===
A college-aged alternate version of Zatanna is the lead character in the DC limited series ''Mystik U'' written by [[Alisa Kwitney]] and illustrated by [[Mike Norton]]. The Zatanna of this continuity enrolls in Mystik University, a school for magic users, alongside other magical DC characters like [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Sargon the Sorcerer]], and her love interest in the series, [[Sebastian Faust]].

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animation====
* Zatanna has made multiple appearances in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:
** Zatanna first appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Julie Brown]]. She is an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close relationship with Bruce Wayne (using the alias John Smith) during the years in which Bruce was traveling the globe learning skills from Zatanna's father that later serves well as Batman, in particular, escape artistry. In the episode [[Zatanna (Batman: The Animated Series)|"Zatanna"]], she visits [[Gotham City]] with her magic show, but finds herself being framed by criminal magic debunker Montague Kane. Batman helps Zatanna clear her name, and by the end of their confrontation with Kane, she realizes Batman is really "John Smith". At the end of the episode, the two promise to keep in touch, as dear friends.
[[File:Zatanna Animated.jpg|thumb|Zatanna seen in ''[[Gotham Girls]]''.]]
** Zatanna makes two appearances in ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', voiced by [[Stacie Randall]]. In "A Little Night Magic", Zatanna walks home on her own after a magic show and has some adventures on the way: She turns a robber's gun into a snake, splits a truck in half when it almost runs her over, and turns some street thugs into toads after they take her hat. In "Hold the Tiger", Zatanna stops Catwoman from stealing the Cat's Eye Opals from a jewelry store. Zatanna does not arrest Catwoman but instead asks for help in finding her [[white tiger]].
** Zatanna made a cameo appearance in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. In the episode "Out of the Past", an elderly Bruce Wayne is looking through a collection of pictures on his computer of past loves, alongside [[Lois Lane]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Barbara Gordon]].
[[File:Zatanna (Justice League Unlimited).png|thumb|Zatanna as seen in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.|288x288px]]
** Zatanna reappears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]] in "This Little Piggy" and by [[Juliet Landau]] in "The Balance". In "This Little Piggy", she helps Batman search for [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] after the villainess turned [[Wonder Woman]] into a pig. Zatanna is apparently aware of Batman's true identity since her last appearance and knows well enough to perceive the Dark Knight's romantic relationship with Wonder Woman. It's revealed that after her encounter with Batman that she somehow came across actual magic power, which she now uses to help people as a crimefighter and secretly uses them at the same time during her magic show tours for public entertainment. Like her comic book counterpart, her spells are often cast backwards, but almost equally often cast without words, and on one occasion, speaking normally. Zatanna also appeared in "The Balance" amongst the magic-based superheroes affected by the disturbance in the magical balance. In "Destroyer", Zatanna appears as one of many [[Justice League]] members called to help fight the invading [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] forces. DCAU writer [[Paul Dini]] wrote both of Zatanna's appearances described above. In 1998, [[Alan Burnett]] told ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'': "Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he's secretly in love with her. It's something we try not to talk about too much".
[[File:ZatannaCM.jpg|thumb|Teenage Zatanna in ''Cartoon Monsoon''.]]
* Two episodes of a Cartoon Monsoon contest entry called ''Zatanna: Trial of the Crystal Wand'' feature Zatanna as a teenage hero who is a cross between ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Buffy Summers|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. This saw her match wits with [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], and featured her father (referred to only as "Zatara") as well as the new character of Zatanna's older, non-magic-wielding brother (named "Damon" in the second episode).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/legends-of-yesterday-dc-comics-15-most-forgotten-cartoons/|title=Legends of Yesterday: DC Comics' 15 Most Forgotten Cartoons|date=December 3, 2016|website=Comic Book Resource|last=Webber|first=Tim|access-date=May 31, 2022}}</ref>
* Zatanna appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', with Jennifer Hale reprising her role. In the teaser of "Chill of the Night!", she and Batman stop [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] from robbing a museum exhibit displaying the history of magicians. Though she relies primarily on vocal spells, she is shown to be able to effectively wield Kadabra's magic wand after Abra gags her mouth shut and when she tries to remove it she pulls out a stream of handkerchiefs stuffed in her mouth. Zatanna gets Kadabra's wand and makes the handkerchiefs disappear, then snaps the wand. While Batman holds back the mind control slaves, Zatanna battles Kadabra, and traps Abra in her hat. She later pulls out a tiny bird cage with Kadabra in it, winning the magic battle. This version wears a slightly modified version of her original outfit, with her trademark fishnets replaced by purple tights.

* Zatanna appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2011/09/new-young-justice-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-october-2011-episode-details/|title= New ''Young Justice'', ''Batman: The Brave And The Bold'' October 2011 Episode Details|first= Jim|last= Harvey|date= September 27, 2011|publisher= Worldsfinestonline.com|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233017/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2011/09/new-young-justice-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-october-2011-episode-details/|archive-date= April 26, 2014|url-status= live|access-date= April 25, 2014}}</ref> voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]. This version is only fourteen years old at the beginning, and her romantic entanglements involving Batman are instead transferred to Robin. In the episode "Humanity", Zatara initially brings Zatanna to Mount Justice in [[Happy Harbor]] to meet the team, and asks the kids give Zatanna a tour of Mount Justice. They pretend to go along with that request, quickly use [[Miss Martian]]'s ship to leave the cave and track down [[Red Tornado]] with Zatanna, referring to her departure with them as "kidnapping". Zatara was displeased that his daughter went on a mission with the team. She returns in the episode "Secrets", where she and [[Tigress (DC Comics)#In other media|Artemis]] head to [[Manhattan]] on Halloween night, but are ambushed and captured by Harm, a psychotic teenager wielding the mystical sword of [[Beowulf]]. While Harm interrogates Artemis, Zatanna attempts to conjure a spell through her gag. The ghost of Harm's murdered sister, [[Secret (Greta Hayes)|Secret]], soon appears and removes the tape from Zatanna's mouth, allowing her to rescue Artemis. The three girls defeat Harm and allow Secret's spirit to move on to the afterlife. Afterwards, Zatanna promises to erect a proper grave for Secret, who had previously been buried in Harm's backyard. In "Misplaced", Zatanna is with the team when all the adults disappear. She is able to use a spell to locate [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] on Roanoke Island. Unable to use powers on him, she dons the Helmet of Fate as a last-ditch effort. After Klarion escapes, Nabu refuses to relinquish Zatanna as his host, until her father offers himself as Nabu's host. After making Batman promise to take care of her, Zatara dons the helmet and leaves Zatanna with the rest of the team. She then moves into Mount Justice with Miss Martian and Superboy and joins the team full-time, but is shown to be clearly devastated by the loss of her father. She and [[Rocket (DC Comics)|Rocket]] are later shown as adult members of the Justice League. Nightwing was in the past romantic relationship with her who gave him an enchanted amulet without asking for its purpose. In season 3, it is shown that Nabu, Zatara and Zatanna have agreement in which Zatanna could meet Zatara one hour per years. In "Early Warning", Zatanna with enchanted amulet helps the Outsider team battling Klarion and his Project Rutabaga monster. She changes the monster back into the meta human victims and deletes Klarion markings from them. She then orders Beast Boy to stay away and then sending both of her and Klarion to the Tower of Fate, effectively sealing him there.
* Zatanna appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', with Lacey Chabert reprising the role while her child form is voiced by Dayci Brookshire. In "Zombie King", she and [[Swamp Thing]] help Batman fight Solomon Grundy when he raises an army of zombies with a magical gem. In "Trick or Threat", she, Batman, Doctor Fate, and John Constantine are turned into children by Klarion the Witch Boy so that he can lure them into a trap at the House of Mystery and steal the Helmet of Fate. In "Speed Demon", Zatanna helps Batman defeat enchanted Harley Quinn by Brother Night, who later enchants the Batmobile where it wraps and gags, and separating Zatanna from her hat and takes her on a ride. After Batman and Etrigan the Demon free Zatanna and have both the enchanted Batmobile and the ice cream truck that was enchanted by [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] teleported to Brother Night's lair, Brother Night and his followers get away as Batman and Zatanna claim the enchanted orb that Brother Night used on the Batmobile that he left behind. In "Hat Trick", Zatanna was helping Batman and Jason Blood fight the possessed mannequins until Felix Faust appears and makes off with her hat. Upon tracing Felix Faust to the [[Hebrides]], they are transported by Merlin and discover Faust's plan to use Zatanna's hat to summon the demon Ghast on the world as a way to regain his youth. Zatanna engages Felix Faust in battle while Batman and Etrigan the Demon work to prevent Ghast from reaching the mainland. As Felix Faust animates a gargoyle, Zatanna uses every trick in her arsenal where she destroys the gargoyle and chains Felix Faust up with the chains she conjured. Once Zatanna regains her hat, she casts a spell to send Ghast back to where he came from.
* Zatanna appears as a central protagonist in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced again by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. She's a teenager at Metropolis High, has purple hair and is both a dramatic fashionista (providing [[Wonder Woman]] with her alter ego as Greek exchange student Diana Prince) and an entertainer for birthday parties. While Zatanna's personality is based on her ''Young Justice'' counterpart, she is not a rebel type but still loves her father.
* Zatanna has a minor, non-speaking role in ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]''. She helped the Justice League defeat the [[Queen of Fables]] by sealing her in a U.S. Master Tax Guide Book, but was later forced by a court order to release her. Zatanna is later called by Batman to release the other members of the Justice League, who were previously imprisoned in a book by the Queen of Fables, before leaving with them to defeat [[Doctor Psycho]] and his army of [[Parademon]]s.

====Live-action====
[[File:Serinda Swan as Zatanna Zatara.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Serinda Swan]] as Zatanna Zatara in ''[[Smallville]]''.]]
Zatanna is a recurring character in the final three seasons of ''[[Smallville]]'', portrayed by [[Serinda Swan]]. The character first appeared late in [[Smallville (season 8)|season eight]] episode "Hex". She is described as the daughter of the deceased [[John Zatara]], "the world's greatest magician". Zatanna is introduced at the Ace of Clubs, the scene of [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]])'s birthday party. To enliven things, Zatanna uses magic to make characters' inner desires come true—Chloe is physically transformed to resemble her cousin, [[Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]), for example, and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark]] ([[Tom Welling]]) becomes "normal". Zatanna later approaches [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) and offers him a deal: she will grant him a wish if he returns her father's magical book to her. Once she acquires the Book of Zatara from Green Arrow, whom she recognizes as Oliver, she reveals her aim is to use it to resurrect her father. Because Clark is vulnerable to magic, and Oliver lacks the power to stop her, Zatanna has to realize for herself that her father sacrificed himself so she could live. She later goes to Oliver to explain herself, and decides to help him if he encounters any supernatural foes along the way by leaving him her phone number. Swan reprises the role in the [[Smallville (season 9)|ninth season]] episode "Warrior". In [[Smallville (season 10)|season ten]] episodes which feature the government attempting to hunt down the [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]], Zatanna's picture is shown among their targets. Although not portrayed by Swan, an actor in costume represents Zatanna in the episode "Icarus". In "Fortune", Zatanna is used as a plot device; the episode establishes her as having sent an enchanted bottle of wine to Clark and Lois on the night of their engagement party, which sets the events of that episode in motion.
