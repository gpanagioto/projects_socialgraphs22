==Fictional character biography==
As a child, Lester Verde was severely bullied. When complaining about it to his mother, she noted his creative use of insults against his tormentors and sparked his desire to use his creativity to become a writer.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Howard the Duck'' #17</ref>

Originally a [[journalism]] student whose yellow journalism got his professor fired, his hand is severed by a miniature guillotine when performing with the punk band Mildred Horowitz. This is a big factor in his becoming the villain Doctor Bong. How he developed his paraphernalia was never explained.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

It is revealed that he was also a skilled scientist, using his knowledge of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] to create several devices and creatures to do his bidding, particularly [[Fifi the Duck]], who was the closest thing Bong had to a henchwoman.<ref name=autogenerated1/> He lives in a castle on a remote island, and can stun or kill by ringing his bell-shaped head.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The Legion of Regrettable Supervillains: Oddball Criminals from Comic Book History |date=2017 |publisher=Quirk Books |isbn=978-1594749322 |page=216}}</ref>

He had a longtime crush on [[Beverly Switzler]], whom he eventually married.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=180}}</ref>  Before he was removed from the book, [[Steve Gerber]] had intended their marriage to last and for her to no longer be a main character in the ''Howard the Duck'' series. After Gerber left, [[Bill Mantlo]] brought Beverly, now single again, back to the book.

[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] later pitted Bong against [[She-Hulk]], trying to uncensor sanitized violent television so that his [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] [[multiple birth|quintuplets]] would be raised not finding violence at all attractive. She-Hulk, using her abilities to break the [[fourth wall]], manages to defeat him.<ref>{{cite comic|title=The Sensational She-Hulk|issue=#5|volume=2|date=Sept. 1989| publisher=Marvel|story=The Doctor Is In!}}</ref>

It is later revealed in his initial appearance that he had given up supervillainy to obtain a [[PhD]] in [[psychology]]. His first patient is [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], who came to him for treatment after the events of the ''Dead Reckoning''.<ref>''Deadpool'' #27</ref> He was, however, back to supervillainy by the [[Max (comics)|Max]] [[Howard the Duck]] series.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Bong later appears as one of the many villains in a bar that [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]] enter in search for information. They defeat all the villains, with Bong himself accidentally taking out the [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]]. At sword point, Bong reveals all the information he knows about current power struggles.<ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #3.</ref>

He appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the Bar with No Name.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #562</ref>

Doctor Bong is one of the many villains kidnapped into a roller derby staged by the cosmic game-obsessed entity called the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. The bullet proof nature of Bong's helmet is a vital part of the hero's winning plan.<ref>''X-Men: To Serve and Protect'' #4 (Feb. 2011)</ref>

Doctor Bong created imperfect clones of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], [[Moon Knight]], and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and lured Deadpool into teaming up with them. While at their main base the real Secret Avengers infiltrated the base causing the real Steve Rogers to battle with Deadpool. After pummeling each other, the real Moon Knight steps in and things finally calm down enough that Cap and Deadpool can talk, Doctor Bong realizes that he has officially lost. He sets off an explosion that kills the Marc Spector and Natasha Romanoff clones, apparently collapsing the building on all the occupants.<ref>''Deadpool'' #28</ref> Deadpool then teams up with the [[Secret Avengers]] to stop Doctor Bong. Doctor Bong tries to confuse the Secret Avengers and Deadpool by dressing all his genetic regenerative clones as Deadpool. Then during the fight Deadpool slips away and cons Doctor Bong to think that he is one of his genetic clones and escapes with Doctor Bong. Black Widow makes Doctor Bong crash his escape car and Deadpool brings the unconscious Doctor Bong body back to the Secret Avengers, after the Secret Avengers kill all the fake Deadpools. Doctor Bong wakes up and about set another explosion using his bell hand, but Deadpool slices off his arm leaving him helpless in the hands of the Secret Avengers.<ref>''Deadpool'' #29</ref>

Doctor Bong later attended a support group called Supervillains Anonymous that was held at a church and also attended by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], [[Hippo (comics)|Hippo]], [[Looter (comics)|Looter]], [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] II, and others.<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #3</ref>

After hiring the [[Headmen]] (consisting of [[Angar the Screamer]], [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Shrunken Bones|Shrunken Bones]], [[Gorilla-Man#Arthur Nagan|Gorilla-Man]], [[Ruby Thursday]], and [[Chondu the Mystic]]) as backup, Doctor Bong breaks into the [[Beyond Corporation©]] so he can use its powerful [[anechoic chamber]] in conjunction with his "Cosmic Bong" to turn himself into a god. Bong and his allies are defeated and handed over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] by Spider-Man, who was suffering from [[laryngitis]] at the time.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Jai Nitz|penciller = Ron Salas|inker = Ron Salas|story = The Quiet Room|title = The Amazing Spider-Man Annual|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = 10 December 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>
