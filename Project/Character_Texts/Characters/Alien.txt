Hello boys. No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you. Very well, I shall show my true form.  Rah rah rah rah-rah. Rah rah rah rah.  How about this?  Dy-no-mite!   Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh huh.  Don't piss on the moon, babe. All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take?  All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings.  I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay. That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning. Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches.  We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real.  A few billion years ago we realized, "what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer, and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great!  Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun! Why? That should get the relay working again.  Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been canceled. 
I seek the life forms that made this.  Oh yeah?  You're gonna build me another one, see? Everyone down on the ground!  Get those hands up! Let me see those hands! Do it now! I mean it! Show me those hands! I'm Baby Fark McGee-zax, the greatest gangster this universe has ever seen, right?!
