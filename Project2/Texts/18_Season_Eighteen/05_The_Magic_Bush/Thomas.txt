You've got a problem, Stotch! You ''know'' what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone! Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now! So, thuh so you flew it back here in time. Well, these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone!  How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that! It's okay honey, the- Oh for God's sakes!  That DOES IT! You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal! Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?! Help us with the drones spying on us!! It's okay, honey.
