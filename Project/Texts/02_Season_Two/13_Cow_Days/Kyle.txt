Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs. Dude, that kicks ass! You suck, Cartman! Give me that! Hey! It hit her right in the mouth! But ih- Here, give me some money, Cartman! Lend me money, fat boy! Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. Mom, give me some money! I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. I will if you give me money! Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw. Is it like a- haunted house or something? No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls. You'd better be right, dude. Okay. That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen! That was a waste of money, Cartman! We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game. This ride better be good! We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour! Finally! Yeah. Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me! Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls! You dumbass, Cartman! No, it's not cool! How much do we have left, Cartman? How much do we have left, Cartman?! What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman! You son of a bitch! Aaargh! Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls! Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it? Give him your food stamps, Kenny! Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure! Okay. Here we go. Hey! That was right on target. That does it! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged! Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator. This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth! It worked! No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there. What?! You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win- Damnit, I have to have those dolls!  Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000. Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!  Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open! All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman? That wasn't quite ten seconds. Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice! What'd you say, Cartman?? I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull. Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull. Okay, Cartman. You ready? Open the gate!  That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything! Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball. That's better. Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing! Get up! Get UP! Dude, I think we broke him. ..Oh. We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it? Damn it! You think? He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute. Yeah, I think so. Hey, where's Cartman? He's up in, like, twenty minutes! Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake. What do you mean? Hang on, Cartman! Go help him, Kenny! You bastards! How many ball does that get us? You will? We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls! What are we gonna do with them? ..What the-? After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!  Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh. Really? What about? No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
