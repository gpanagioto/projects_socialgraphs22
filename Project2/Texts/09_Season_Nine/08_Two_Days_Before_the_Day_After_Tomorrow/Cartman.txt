Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around. You know how? Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box. Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.  Awesome. We're not moving. Maybe you have the parking brake on. Other way! Other way! Stan... beaver dam!   Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble! I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about. Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at ''my house'' all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail!   Yeah. Shyeah, that was pretty funny. Hehey, no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault! Well they should've gotten out of there! We did! Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this! Oh hey, Kyle.  Hngh, totally.  Aw crap!  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?! Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?! Why?  "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility." Help! Help!  Not so fast, Kyle. Hand over the gold! You know what I'm talkng about! All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!  I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now! Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle! I want... your Jew gold!   Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God!  ...Aw man.  Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.
