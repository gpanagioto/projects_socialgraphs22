Hello, children. What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?! Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis? Hello, children. Aaaaah! Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you? Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before. Doctor! No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead. Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so! Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! Oh, sorry. But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here. Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness? Aaaaaaaaaah! Mayor, we've got a big problem. Actually, uh- I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead! No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!  Aw, the hell with you both! Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!  Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them. Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?! Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately? Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town. I'm working on it children. The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. Just look for anything suspicious. You better let me take that Kyle. I gotta call this hotline number children. Look out children! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! You did it children!
