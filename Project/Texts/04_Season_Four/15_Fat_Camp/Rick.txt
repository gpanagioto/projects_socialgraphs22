I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get you oriented.  I'll take care of him from here, ma'am. Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!  Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is ''[jumps] fun'', right gang? Wait a second.  I could've swore that- Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat! Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise!  I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids? Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan,  Doing great kids! Come on!  Well, I sure enjoyed ''my'' carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang? Hey kids! Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave. So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT! Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet.  I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight. They'll do it. And we're gonna reach for the sky...  And down to the ground.  And up to the sky...  What's happening? Oh! But he's not ready yet. They ''can'' lose the weight if they try. Good-bye, Chad. Naturally. Oh, don't thank us. We failed you. Well, it's alright with me. Parents? Bubbye.
