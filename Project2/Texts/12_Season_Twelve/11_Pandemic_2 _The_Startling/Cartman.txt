You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig. Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time. That's right. Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way.  What is it? Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants!  Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs? Dude, it's Craig! Well do you ''mind'' tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig? Yeah, it's coming from up there. Dude, that's awesome.  Dude, Craig, we should go back now.  Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around. Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up! That guy's an asshole!
