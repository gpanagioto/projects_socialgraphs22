Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.

It's called ''The Catcher In The Rye'', and it has some very... risqu√© parts...  ...and strong vulgar language... ...and in fact, many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate. Tonight, I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the- Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by ''The Catcher In The Rye'', but he was just a kook!  You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!
