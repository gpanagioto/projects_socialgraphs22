We can?  Whoa. Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Yeah! Neato! Pirates ho!   Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this. It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it. Huh, who, you mean you? No, I'm sick of it! He's right, lads. To adventure! Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons? Uhh,  mahjey burazi? Oh. He-he says they're in there.  ARRRRRRGH! Okay!  Have a good day!   What's "port"?! One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches. Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed. Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework. And our parents hollered at us! So we wanted to come here and be pirates. Huh? Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike? Yeah, me too.  Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home. Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did.
