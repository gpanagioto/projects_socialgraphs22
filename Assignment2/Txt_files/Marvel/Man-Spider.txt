'''Spider-Man''' is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; superheroes (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], he [[first appearance|first appeared]] in the [[anthology]] comic book ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. He has since been featured in films, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of '''Peter Parker''', an orphan raised by his [[Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]] in [[New York City]] after his parents [[Richard and Mary Parker]] died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many [[List of Spider-Man supporting characters|supporting characters]], such as [[Flash Thompson]], [[J. Jonah Jameson]], and [[Harry Osborn]]; [[romantic interest]]s [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Mary Jane Watson]], and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]; and [[List of Spider-Man enemies|foes]] such as [[Doctor Octopus]], the [[Green Goblin]], and [[Venom (character)|Venom]]. In his [[origin story]], he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial [[spider web]]s of his own design.

When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of [[sidekick]] to the [[protagonist]]. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from [[Queens]], New York, as Spider-Man's [[secret identity]], whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.<ref name="Wright">{{Cite book |last=Wright, Bradford W. |title=Comic Book Nation |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press : Baltimore |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8018-7450-5}}</ref> While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like [[Captain America]] and [[Batman]]; he thus had to learn for himself that "[[With great power comes great responsibility|with great power there must also come great responsibility]]"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later [[retroactive continuity|retroactively attributed]] to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.

Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several [[List of Spider-Man titles|comic book series]], the first and longest-lasting of which is ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following [[Dying Wish|a body swap plot]] in which Peter appears to die.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sacks |first=Ethan |date=January 12, 2014 |title=Exclusive: Peter Parker to return from death in 'Amazing Spider-Man' #1 this April |work=[[New York Daily News|Daily News]] |location=New York City |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/comics/exclusive-spider-man-alter-ego-peter-parker-return-death-article-1.1575793 |url-status=live |access-date=January 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712234030/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/comics/exclusive-spider-man-alter-ego-peter-parker-return-death-article-1.1575793 |archive-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> Marvel has also published books featuring [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate versions of Spider-Man]], including ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'', which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in [[Ultimate Marvel|an alternate universe]]; and ''[[Ultimate Comics Spider-Man]]'', which depicts the teenager [[Miles Morales]], who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death.

===Creation and development===
[[File:Spider Strikes v1n1 i05 Wentworth.png|thumb|right|Richard Wentworth a.k.a. the [[Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider]] in the pulp magazine ''The Spider''. Stan Lee stated that it was the name of this character that inspired him to create a character that would become Spider-Man.<ref name="LeeMair" />]]
In 1962, with the success of the [[Fantastic Four]], Marvel Comics editor and head writer [[Stan Lee]] was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.<ref name="DeFalco">{{Cite book |last1=DeFalco, Tom |url=https://archive.org/details/spidermanultimat00defa |title=Spider-Man: The Ultimate Guide |last2=Lee, Stan |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7894-7946-4 |editor-last=O'Neill, Cynthia |location=New York |author-link=Tom DeFalco |author-link2=Stan Lee}}</ref>{{rp|1}} As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.<ref>{{Cite news |title=STAN LEE: CAUGHT IN SPIDEY'S WEB - The Washington Post | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/02/04/stan-lee-caught-in-spideys-web/9e7bf42e-4287-4f9c-9fa1-a5f73fb2ee7e/}}</ref> In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman [[pulp magazine]] crime fighter the [[Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider]] as a great influence,<ref name="LeeMair">{{Cite book |last1=Lee, Stan |title=Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee |last2=Mair, George |publisher=Fireside |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-684-87305-3 |author-link=Stan Lee}}</ref>{{rp|130}} and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a [[spider]] climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.<ref group="note">{{Cite book |last1=Lee, Stan |title=Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee |last2=Mair, George |publisher=Fireside |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-684-87305-3 |author-link=Stan Lee}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2020}} Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says he chose "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name "Spider-Boy" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.<ref name="alter104">{{Cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Roy |date=August 2011 |title=Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview! |journal=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |issue=104 |pages=3–45}}</ref> He also decided to insert a [[hyphen]] in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red and blue costume which starts with an "S" and ends with "man"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Little-known sci-fi fact: Why Stan Lee put a hyphen in Spider-Man – Syfy |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/little-known-sci-fi-fact-why-stan-lee-put-hyphen-spider-man |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190625022700/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/little-known-sci-fi-fact-why-stan-lee-put-hyphen-spider-man |archive-date=June 25, 2019 |access-date=June 25, 2019}}</ref> (although artist [[Steve Ditko]] intended the character to have an orange and purple costume).<ref name="oandp">{{Cite web |last=Johnston |first=Rich |author-link=Rich Johnston |date=August 31, 2020 |title=Steve Ditko Designed Spider-Man to be Orange and Purple |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/steve-ditko-wanted-spider-man-to-be-orange-and-purple/ |access-date=August 31, 2020 |language=en-GB}}</ref> At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.<ref group="note">''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' interview with Stan Lee, quoted in ''The Steve Ditko Reader'' by [[Greg Theakston]] (Pure Imagination, Brooklyn, NY; {{ISBN|1-56685-011-8}}), p. 12 (unnumbered). "He gave me 1,000 reasons why Spider-Man would never work. Nobody likes spiders; it sounds too much like Superman; and how could a teenager be a superhero? Then I told him I wanted the character to be a very human guy, someone who makes mistakes, who worries, who gets acne, has trouble with his girlfriend, things like that. [Goodman replied,] 'He's a hero! He's not an average man!' I said, 'No, we make him an average man who happens to have super powers, that's what will make him good.' He told me I was crazy".</ref> Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series ''Amazing Adult Fantasy'', which was renamed ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' for that single issue, #15 ([[cover-date]]d August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).<ref name="gcd-af">[http://www.comics.org/series/1514/ ''Amazing Fantasy'' (Marvel, 1962 series)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310160810/http://www.comics.org/series/1514/ |date=March 10, 2011 }} at the Grand Comics Database: "1990 copyright renewal lists the publication date as June 5, 1962"; "[T]he decision to cancel the series had not been made when it went to print, since it is announced that future issues will include a Spider-Man feature."</ref> In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that ''Amazing Fantasy'' would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.<ref name="alter104" /> While this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spiderman{{sic}} ... will appear every month in ''Amazing''."<ref name=gcd-af/><ref>"Important Announcement from the Editor!", ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (Aug. 1962), reprinted at {{Cite book |title=Amazing Fantasy Omnibus |publisher=Marvel Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-0785124580 |editor-last=Sedlmeier |editor-first=Cory |page=394}}</ref>

Regardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept and approached artist [[Jack Kirby]]. As [[comics historian]] [[Greg Theakston]] recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with [[Joe Simon]] in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages.<ref name="Theakston" /> Steve Ditko would be the inker.<ref group="note">{{Cite book |last=Ditko, Steve |title=Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-893905-06-1 |editor-last=Roy Thomas |editor-link=Roy Thomas |author-link=Steve Ditko}} "'Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in #15 [of what became titled ''Amazing Fantasy'']. He would be called Spider-Man. Jack would do the penciling and I was to ink the character.' At this point still, Stan said Spider-Man would be a teenager with a magic ring which could transform him into an adult hero—Spider-Man. I said it sounded like the [[Fly (Red Circle Comics)|Fly]], which Joe Simon had done for [[Archie Comics]]. Stan called Jack about it but I don't know what was discussed. I never talked to Jack about Spider-Man... Later, at some point, I was given the job of drawing Spider-Man'".</ref> When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I ''hated'' the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".<ref name="Theakston">{{Cite book |last=Theakston |first=Greg |title=The Steve Ditko Reader |publisher=Pure Imagination |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-56685-011-7 |location=Brooklyn, New York}}</ref>{{rp|12}} Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
{{blockquote|One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....<ref name="ditko-history" />}}

Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.<ref name=gcd-af/> As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers."<ref>{{Cite news |date=December 8, 2010 |title=Deposition of Stan Lee |page=37 |publisher=United States District Court, Southern District of New York: "Marvel Worldwide, Inc., et al., vs. Lisa R.

In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in ''Comic Fan'' #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up.

But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands."<ref name="Theakston" />{{rp|14}} Ditko claimed in a rare interview with [[Jonathan Ross]] that the costume was initially envisioned with an orange and purple color scheme rather than the more famous red and blue.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnston |first=Rich |date=August 31, 2020 |title=Steve Ditko Designed Spider-Man to be Orange and Purple |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/steve-ditko-wanted-spider-man-to-be-orange-and-purple/ |access-date=August 31, 2020 |website=Bleeding Cool}}</ref>
[[File:Amazing Fantasy 15.jpg|thumb|left|''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (Aug. 1962) first introduced the character. It was a gateway to commercial success for the superhero and inspired the launch of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' comic book. Cover art by penciller [[Jack Kirby]] and inker [[Steve Ditko]]]]
Kirby disputed Lee's version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and [[Joe Simon]], who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the [[Crestwood Publications]] comic ''Black Magic'', who was subsequently not used.<ref group="note">Jack Kirby in "Shop Talk: Jack Kirby", ''[[Will Eisner]]'s [[The Spirit|Spirit]] Magazine'' #39 (February 1982): "Spider-Man was discussed between [[Joe Simon]] and myself. It was the last thing Joe and I had discussed. We had a strip called 'The Silver Spider.' The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called ''Black Magic''. ''Black Magic'' folded with [[Crestwood Publications|Crestwood]] (Simon & Kirby's 1950s comics company) and we were left with the script. I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider-Man, see, a superhero character. I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back... and I said Spider-Man would be a fine character to start with. But Joe had already moved on. So the idea was already there when I talked to Stan".</ref> Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby's account, asserting that ''Black Magic'' was not a factor, and that he (Simon) devised the name "Spider-Man" (later changed to "The Silver Spider"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's [[Archie Comics]] superhero the [[Fly (Red Circle Comics)|Fly]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Simon |first=Joe |title=Joe Simon: My Life in Comics |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84576-930-7 |location=London, UK}}</ref> Artist [[Steve Ditko]] stated that Lee liked the name [[Hawkman]] from [[DC Comics]], and that "Spider-Man" was an outgrowth of that interest.<ref name="ditko-history">{{Cite book |last=Ditko, Steve |title=Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-893905-06-1 |editor-last=Roy Thomas |editor-link=Roy Thomas |author-link=Steve Ditko}}</ref>

Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results—in Simon's description, "[[Captain America]] with cobwebs".<ref group="note">Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. ''The Comic Book Makers'' (Crestwood/II, 1990) {{ISBN|1-887591-35-4}}. "There were a few holes in Jack's never-dependable memory. For instance, there was no ''Black Magic'' involved at all. ... Jack brought in the Spider-Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider. Kirby laid out the story to Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb, gets his powers from the ring, and goes forth to fight crime armed with The Silver Spider's old web-spinning pistol. Stan Lee said, 'Perfect, just what I want.' After obtaining permission from publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee told Kirby to pencil-up an origin story. Kirby... using parts of an old rejected superhero named Night Fighter... revamped the old Silver Spider script, including revisions suggested by Lee. But when Kirby showed Lee the sample pages, it was Lee's turn to gripe. He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers. Kirby had him turn into... Captain America with cobwebs. He turned Spider-Man over to Steve Ditko, who... ignored Kirby's pages, tossed the character's magic ring, web-pistol and goggles... and completely redesigned Spider-Man's costume and equipment. In this life, he became high-school student Peter Parker, who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. ... Lastly, the Spider-Man logo was redone and a dashing hyphen added".</ref> Writer [[Mark Evanier]] notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 and the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man''. Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was "too busy" to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was, said Evanier, "always busy".<ref name="Evanier">{{Cite book |last1=Evanier, Mark |title=Kirby: King of Comics |last2=Gaiman, Neil |publisher=Abrams |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8109-9447-8 |author-link=Mark Evanier |author-link2=Neil Gaiman}}</ref>{{rp|127}} Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man, as drawn and envisioned by Kirby, was too similar to the Fly.<ref name="Evanier" />{{rp|127}}

Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that "[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis." It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed. "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained." Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as "the first [[work for hire]] artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko stated, "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man".<ref>Bell, Blake. ''Strange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko'' (2008). Fantagraphic Books.p.54-57.</ref> Ditko did, however, view the published version of Spider-Man as a separate creation to the one he saw in the five pencilled pages that Kirby had completed. To support this Ditko used the analogy of the Kirby/Marvel Thor, which was based on a name/idea of a character in Norse mythology: "If Marvel’s Thor is a valid created work by Jack, his creation, then why isn’t Spider-Man by Stan and me valid created work, our creation?" <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ditko |first=Steve |date=Winter 1999 |title=An Insider's Part of Comics History Jack Kirby's Spider-Man |journal=Alter Ego |issue=3 |page=6}}</ref>

In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Magazine|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', a proto-[[graphic novel]] designed to appeal to older readers. It only lasted for two issues, but it represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' [[Annual publication|summer ''Annual''s]] that began in 1964.<ref>Saffel, Steve.

An early 1970s Spider-Man story ultimately led to the revision of the [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Code]]. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of [[illegal drugs]], even negatively. However, in 1970, the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration's [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|239}} Lee chose the top-selling [[Green Goblin Reborn!|''The Amazing Spider-Man;'' issues #96–98]] (May–July 1971) feature a [[story arc]] depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend [[Harry Osborn]] becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats him by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|239}}

In 1972, a second monthly [[ongoing series]] starring Spider-Man began: ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and supervillains.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Manning |first=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0756692360 |editor-last=Gilbert |editor-first=Laura |page=60 |chapter=1970s}}</ref> From that point on, there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early years===
In [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], [[Queens]], New York City,<ref name=kempton/> [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown High School]] student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his [[Uncle Ben]] and [[Aunt May]]. As depicted in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a [[radioactive]] [[spider]] (erroneously classified as an [[insect]] in the panel) at a science exhibit and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an [[arachnid]]".<ref name="Debut">{{Cite comic |New York]] |writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] |artist=[[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]] |title=[[Amazing Fantasy]] |issue=15 |date=August 1962 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=[[New York City]], [[New York (state)}}</ref> Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a novelty television star. However, "He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing [[Burglar (comics)|thief]], [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben." Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, "With great power there must also come—great responsibility!"<ref name="daniels95">[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]].

Two issues later, Parker, now employed as a teacher at his old high school, meets the enigmatic [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel]], who possesses similar spider powers and suggests that Parker having gained such abilities might not have been a fluke—that Parker has a connection to a [[totem]]ic spider spirit.

After their respective homes are destroyed by a deranged, superpowered former high-school classmate, Parker, Watson, and May move into [[Stark Tower]], and Parker begins working as [[Tony Stark]]'s assistant while again freelancing for ''The [[Daily Bugle]]'' and continuing his teaching.

In issue #537 (Dec. 2006), May is critically wounded by a sniper hired by [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] and enters into a coma. Parker, desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a [[Deal with the Devil|pact]] with the demon-lord [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who saves May's life in exchange for Parker and Watson agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed reality, Spider-Man's identity is secret once again, and in #545 (Jan. 2008), Watson returns and is cold toward him.

Sometime after ''Siege'', MJ invites Peter over so the two of them could gain closure over the marriage that did not happen and the breakup.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #638–641</ref> Later, a massive war ensued between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man to get Lily Hollister's and Osborn's son, in which Spider-Man found that the child was actually Harry's, who later leaves town to raise him. Spider-Man assisted the Avengers in defeating Doctor Octopus' army of Macro-Octobots. He then faced a new Hobgoblin and the Kingpin, but days later, he lamentably lost Marla Jameson in a fight between Alistair Alphonso Smythe's Spider-Slayers.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #648–654</ref>

After helping Anti-Venom (Eddie Brock) reveal Mr. Negative's true identity,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #663–664</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Infested'' #1</ref> The [[Queen (Marvel Comics)|Queen]] was revealed as the true mastermind: she wanted to turn the whole human race into spiders. Mr. Fantastic created a cure using the Anti-Venom Symbiote which Peter's clone Kaine accidentally cured from his mutations, turning him into a perfect clone.

While he and the Avengers battled the Spider-Queen in Central Park, Kaine killed her and Peter managed to get the cure to every citizen via Doctor Octopus's Octobots. He met with Jay and May while they were leaving for Boston.

Because of revealing he had spider-powers, Peter's psychic blind spot was weakened, letting Charlie Cooper know he was Spider-Man, causing Peter to be single once again. Peter gives a last cure sample to MJ, who briefly attempted to keep some spider-powers and then look at the Empire State Building, lit in red and blue in his honor.

In the middle of a fight, Spider-Man was unsuspectedly pinched by one of Doctor Octopus' Octobots programmed to swap consciousness between the two, causing Peter to become trapped in the dying body of his foe while Doctor Octopus claimed Peter's life for himself. In an attempt to take back his life with the little time he had left, Peter broke out of Octopus's cell in the Raft,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699.</ref> leading to a final confrontation between the two in the Avengers Tower. Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he managed to establish a weak link with Otto's mind using an Octobot. In his final moments, Peter forced Otto Octavius to relive all of his memories. Having experienced in a flash all of Peter's trials and tribulations, Otto learned his lesson of power and responsibility and swore to carry on with Peter's life with dignity as a "Superior" Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700.</ref>

A portion of Peter survived in his original body in the form of a subconsciousness.<ref>''The Spider-Man'' #1</ref> Though Otto attempted to rid of this remnant of Peter,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man''#9.</ref> he decided to seek its help sometime later after being overwhelmed by the returned Green Goblin and his Goblin Nation. Realizing that he failed in his role as the "Superior" Spider-Man, having pushed his allies aside and lost his resources in the process, Otto willingly allowed Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat Osborn once and for all and save Anna Maria Marconi, Otto's love.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #27–30.</ref> In the aftermath of Otto's possession of his body, Peter began to amend the relationships damaged by Otto's arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of Parker Industries, a small company founded by Otto after leaving Horizon Labs.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #31.</ref>

While adjusting to his new status quo, especially his position as the CEO of his very own company,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> Peter learned a second person has been bit by the radioactive spider, '''[[Cindy Moon]]'''. Spider-Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms, where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers, in order to avoid drawing Morlun's attention. While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead, he had in fact survived his last encounter against Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #4</ref>
Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as Silk,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #5</ref><ref>''Silk'' (vol. 1) #1</ref> Spider-Man was approached by a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires and the family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #9</ref> During a mission to gather more recruits in A.D. 2099, the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by Otto Octavius, or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #10</ref> With the help of Spider-Woman, who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor's base on Earth-001, the Spider-Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders: the Other, the Bride, and the Scion. These individuals were Kaine, Moon, and Benjamin "Benjy" Parker of Earth-982, respectively.
With the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named Karn, the Spider-Army, including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider-powers known as "Spider-Gwen", launched one final attack on the Inheritors' home of Earth-001. The ritual was stopped, and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth-3145. With the Inheritors neutralized, most of the spider-totems were sent home.

Following the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|revival]] of the Multiverse, Octavius secretly created a digital backup of his mind that ended up inhabiting of the metallic body of Parker Industries' robotic assistant, the Living Brain.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #18''</ref> Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in favor of Parker Industries. As a consequence of this, the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, with the company's trademark invention being a mobile device called the Webware. By 8 months after the revival, Spider-Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter's bodyguard.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #1</ref>

Peter discovered New U as a front of operations for the Jackal, who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology.<ref name="DNM">''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy'' (vol. 1) #1–5.</ref> In the turn of events, the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly, who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place. The Jackal's plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U, which led to the release of the Carrion Virus worldwide.<ref name="DNM" />

After the events of "[[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Go Down Swinging]]," Peter's life was plagued with problems on both sides. As Spider-Man, Mayor Fisk publicly supported him, condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate him from his superhero peers. As Peter Parker, his academic credentials were revoked after being accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius, resulting in his firing from the ''Daily Bugle''. On the other hand, Peter became romantically involved again with Mary Jane.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #1</ref> For a brief time, Peter Parker and Spider-Man were split into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse-engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator.

However, the separation split Peter down the middle, so both individuals did not share Peter's sense of responsibility, resulting in a reckless and vain Spider-Man. Peter eventually managed to reverse the process, and merge his two halves back together before the side-effects could worsen and result in their death.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #2–5</ref> Later, Spider-Man becomes plagued by visions of a mysterious villain known as "[[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|Kindred]]" who has seemingly been working with Mysterio.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #25</ref> As this happened, villains the Black Ant and the Taskmaster captured animal-themed supervillains for Kraven the Hunter as part of a plan to destroy unworthy hunters. Spider-Man was tasked with finding Kraven the Hunter, whose ultimate goal through the hunt was to anger Spider-Man and lead him to kill him, ending his curse. After Spider-Man refused and Dr. Connors saved his child Billy, Kraven lifted the force field from Central Park, allowing Spider-Man, Connors, Billy, and the Black Cat to escape while the Avengers rounded up all the loose criminals.

Notes cultural historian Bradford W. Wright,

{{blockquote|Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', launches an editorial campaign against the "Spider-Man menace." The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's ''Daily Bugle''.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|212}}}}

The mid-1960s stories reflect the political tensions of the time. Early 1960s Marvel stories often deal with the [[Cold War]] and [[Communism]].<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|220–223}} As Wright observes,

{{blockquote|From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant [[student demonstration]]s at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|234–235}}}}

The Goblin is a [[Halloween]]-themed villain, dressing up like an actual [[goblin]] and utilizing a large arsenal of high tech weapons, including a glider and pumpkin-shaped explosives. Unlike most villains, who only aim to kill Spider-Man, the Goblin also targeted his loved ones and showed no remorse in killing them as long as it caused pain to Spider-Man, therefore making him not only Spider-Man's worst enemy, but also Peter Parker's.

{{Quote box
|quote  = The culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes. He's got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He's just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he's more relatable than playboy billionaire [[Iron Man]]. And he's an awkward teenager, not a wizened adult like [[Captain America]]. Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.
