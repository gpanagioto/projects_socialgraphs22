All right, people. People, please! We need everyone to try and stay calm. Look, we all want the President out of here. It's just a matter of how we do it. I know you all want to get rid of him. Listen, everyone. I have a team right now that's trying to locate the President, and I'd like you to hear from Officer Bright, who's leading the search. [the officer adjusts his pants and walks up to the podium] Don't tell me you haven't gotten the President out of here. What? Why are you here talking to me instead of trying to find the President? A fox trap?
