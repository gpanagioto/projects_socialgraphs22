==Fictional character biography==
Bibbo first appears in a [[Suicide Slum]] bar called the [[Ace o' Clubs]]. When [[Superman]] comes in looking for information, Bibbo, thinking this is "some clown in a Superman suit", punches Superman, damaging his hand. He gains respect for the Man of Steel. He would later refer to Superman as his "fav'rit" hero.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=36}}</ref>

During the Eradicator saga, Bibbo teams up with [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] and Raof, a teleporter and a tribute to Marvel's [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], to witness Lobo kill Superman. Lobo gives Bibbo a set of special goggles that will record the battle. All three, however, get drunk on Okarran liquor and thus suffer loss of all memory of the battle, which Superman won by a ruse engineered by the Eradicator artifact. Additionally, Bibbo wore the goggles backwards, and thus the entire recording was of his reactions. As a result, the aliens who retained Lobo to kill Superman have no proof that there even was a battle.

Bibbo becomes a more significant part of the comic when he finds a winning [[lottery]] ticket dropped by [[Gangbuster (DC Comics)|Gangbuster]] and uses the money to buy the Ace o' Clubs bar and to help those living in the slum.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Bibbo attempts to assist Superman when Superman becomes involved in a drawn-out fight against the murderous [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. Bibbo works with [[Professor Hamilton]] on a plan to blast Doomsday with a large laser. They score a direct hit, but the monster is not affected.<ref>{{Cite comic| inker = Dennis Janke| colorist = Dennis Janke| penciller = [[Jon Bogdanove|Bogdanove, Jon]]| story = Doomsday Is Here!| title = Superman: The Man of Steel| volume = | issue = #19| date = January 1993| publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

When Doomsday and Superman ultimately kill each other, Bibbo is on the scene and helps Hamilton use a device to try to perform CPR on Superman, despite the risk of the device killing Bibbo himself. The plan fails and Bibbo is injured. Hamilton takes over the CPR but also fails.<ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #498 (January 1993)</ref>

Shortly afterward, Bibbo encounters a young man who, his family rendered homeless by Doomsday's rampage, is blatantly selling "Death of Superman" commemorative souvenirs during a public commemoration honoring the Man of Steel. At first outraged at the man's crassness, Bibbo feels some sympathy for his losses and buys his entire inventory in order to get him off the street, then offers him a job at the Ace O' Clubs.<ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #20 (February 1993)</ref> While Superman is gone, Bibbo takes to putting on a 'disguise' of sorts and helping out on the streets. Around this time he saves a man from suicide. This is mostly told through tall tales concerning various super-villains.<ref>''Showcase '96'' #10 (November 1996)</ref>

Bibbo briefly takes care of a small white dog named Krypto whom he had saved from drowning, not to be confused with the [[Krypto (comics)|Kryptonian dog of the same name]]. The name was supposed to be "Krypton", but the engraver Bibbo hired to make a name tag made an intentional mistake, trying to extort more money from Bibbo (the price accorded was for six letters). Bibbo took the tag as it was.<ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #502 (July 1993)</ref>

A poster seen by the hero Aztek indicates that at one point, Bibbo fought the hero [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] during a charity boxing event.<ref>''Aztek'' #4 (November 1996)</ref> Later in the series, The Ace O' Clubs bar is the site of a battle between the life-force devouring [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and Aztek.<ref>''Aztek'' #7 (February 1997)</ref> Bibbo and his friends purposely ignore the fight, playing cards instead and trusting others to handle the villain.

In ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', Ordway introduces Professor Bibbowski, Bibbo's pacifist scientist brother.

Bibbo reappears in ''Superman'' #679, shown as one of the champions of Metropolis that the villainous [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]] defeated. He is established by then as having worked in the Ace of Clubs, even bringing himself to boldly menace [[Atom Smasher (DC Comics)|Atom Smasher]] for "Talking trash about Sooperman".<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #27 (July 2009)</ref>

Bibbo returns in 2016 ''Superman'' vol. 4 #4. He is seen arm-wrestling [[Hitman (DC Comics)|Hacken]] and easily beating him, before Superman's fight with Eradicator moves into his bar. Bibbo is shocked to see what appears to be Superman running away from the fight, but quickly realizes Superman is simply trying to lure Eradicator somewhere when there are no innocent bystanders. 

Later Bibbo and his niece show up in Superwoman. When Ultrawoman takes over Metropolis, Bibbo is seen trying to start a fight with her minions but is saved by Natasha Irons and Traci 13.

[[Perry White]] recommends Clark and [[Lois Lane|Lois]] take their [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|son]] over to Bibbo's 'Ace O' Clubs' for burgers.<ref>''Action Comics'' #987 (September 2017)</ref>

At one point, Superman saves Bibbo from being murdered by gun-wielding muggers.<ref>''Action Comics'' #1000 (2018)</ref>
