+++++


Cartman's House. The boys are watching television and laughing.

Stan

That was awesome!

Kyle

Yeah!

Liane

Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?

Cartman

Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.

Liane

Sure hon.

Cartman

And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!

+++++


Terrance and Phillip have just landed.

Phillip

Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.

Terrance

It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.

+++++


Farts.

Phillip

AAAAAH!

+++++


Laughter. The boys are now enjoying their Cheesy Poofs.

Phillip

Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!

Cartman

Did you guys see that? That was sweet.

TV announcer

Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs.

Kyle

Oh, cool.

TV announcer

And now a word from our sponsor.

Sally Struthers

Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help.

Stan

Hey, who's that fat chick?

Kyle

Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.

Stan

Oh.

Sally Struthers

You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce.

Stan

Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.

Kyle

Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.

Cartman

Yeah, HEY!

Sally Struthers

For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.

Cartman

That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?

Sally Struthers

Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.

Cartman

KICK ASS!!

Stan

SWEET!

Kenny

(Woohoo!)

Stan

I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.

+++++


Stan dials up the number.

Kyle

Did they say if it's waterproof?

Stan

Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?

+++++


Listens for the answer.

Stan

Oh.

Kyle

What did she say?

Stan

Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.

Kyle

Ass-rammer.

Stan

Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.

Cartman

When do we get the sports watch?

Stan

Just a second fat-ass!

Cartman

You vas-deferens!

Stan

Hello? No, no, it's a ma- [To his friends, confused.] Vas-deferens?

Kenny

(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)

Stan

Oh.

Kyle

Ask her if we get the watch right away.

Stan

Do we get the sports watch right away?

+++++


Pause.

Stan

She says we do.

All

Cool.

Cartman

I get to wear it first, you guys.

+++++


Mr. Garrison's Classroom.

Kyle

I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.

Cartman

Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.

Mr. Garrison

Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?

+++++


Cartman raises his hand.

Mr. Garrison

Yes, Eric?

Cartman

When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?

Mr. Garrison

Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

+++++


Eric listens.

Mr. Garrison

A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.

Stan

You mean, like Kenny?

Mr. Garrison

Exactly.

Cartman

Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?

Mr. Garrison

[Impatiently.] I don't know Eric, they just do.

+++++


Kyle sniffs at Kenny. Kenny withdraws.

Mr. Garrison

Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.

Cartman

I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!

Wendy

Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!

Cartman

Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!

Wendy

This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!

Cartman

Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!

Wendy

Many would rather die than go to those places!

Cartman

Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!

Mr. Garrison

Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?

Mr. Hat

That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?

+++++


A pack of wild turkeys burst into the classroom.

Clyde

Aaaah!

+++++


Mr. Garrison climbs atop his desk.

Mr. Garrison

What the hell is going on?!

+++++


The turkeys are tearing up the classroom. One of them rips up a Thanksgiving poster and takes it with him.

Clyde

Aaaah!

+++++


A turkey overturns Clyde's desk, dumping Clyde on the ground. Some others vandalize the blackboard. Just as suddenly as they entered, the turkeys exit, closing the door behind them. Silence ensues.

Mr. Garrison

Well, you don't see that everyday.

+++++


City Hall.

Mayor McDaniels

Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor.

Aide 2

It should be something festive.

+++++


Mephesto and Kevin burst into the office.

Mephesto

Mayor, we've got a very big problem.

Mayor McDaniels

Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?

Mephesto

Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.

Mayor McDaniels

[Warily.] Uh huh.

Mephesto

You know, to provide food for the needy.

Mayor McDaniels

[Sarcastically.] Of course.

+++++


Aide 1 glances at her.

Mephesto

Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off.

+++++


Mayor McDaniels twirls her chair around and twirls her finger 'round her ear.

Mayor McDaniels

Naturally.

+++++


Her aides snicker, then she turns again.

Mayor McDaniels

Oh, do go on.

Mephesto

We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short.

+++++


Mayor McDaniels turns around and pulls out a cuckoo clock, which chimes a couple of times. Her aides snicker. Aide 2 has his ears wiggling. She puts the clock away and the aide stops his ears.

+++++


Mayor McDaniels faces Mephesto again.

Mayor McDaniels

You were saying?

Mephesto

They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.

Mayor McDaniels

[With feigned shock.] Oh, my!

+++++


Turns around and pulls out a donkey, which heehaws a couple of times. Her aides chuckle.

+++++


Mephesto having observed how the Mayor was reacting to him.

Mephesto

Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.

Mayor McDaniels

Uh now why would you say that?

+++++


Cartman's house. The kids burst through the front door.

Everybody

Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?

Cartman

I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?

Liane

[Peeks.] Not yet hon.

Stan

Damn.

Kyle

Hey, look you guys.

TV announcer

And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special.

+++++


They are in a snowed-in town.

Terrance

I sure am cold, Phillip.

Phillip

Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.

Terrance

Gosh, I hope we don't starve.

+++++


Phillip farts a high one and Terrance laughs.

Phillip

Ah, a squeaker!

+++++


The boys laugh and then the doorbell rings, and a couple of knocks follow. The boys stand stiff not knowing what to do until...

+++++


Kyle bolts to the door.

Kyle

The digital sports watch is here.

+++++


The kids open the door smiling in anticipation. An emaciated Ethiopian kid stands looking back at them, with baggage in hand. Their smiles turn into surprises. The postal truck takes off.

Cartman

What the hell?

Stan

Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.

Kyle

Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.

Stan

Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.

Kyle

Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.

+++++


The Ethiopian 'speaks' and clicks something.

Kyle

Whoa! That was cool.

Stan

Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?

Kyle

What's your name dude?

+++++


The Ethiopian kid clicks something ending with,

Kid

Mabin.

Stan

I think he said his name is Marvin.

Cartman

Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.

+++++


Kyle steps out with Stan and shakes Marvin's hand.

Kyle

Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.

Cartman

Hey mooom?

Liane

Yes hon?

Cartman

We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?

Liane

Sure, hon.

Cartman

Sweet.

+++++


Cartman steps outside with Kenny.

Stan

Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.

Kyle

Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.

Cartman

No no! He's my son! I adopted him.

Stan

It was my mom's credit card.

Kyle

Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.

Cartman

Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.

Kyle

Totally.

+++++


Kenny slugs Cartman.

Cartman

Ahh!

+++++


Stark's Pond. A couple is walking near the pond. Romantic music is playing.

Woman

Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.

Man

Not as beautiful as you.

Woman

[Swooning.] Ooooh.

+++++


The couple embraces and kisses as a horde of turkeys storm the pond. The guy hears them and looks over her shoulder.

Man

Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.

Woman

Oohh, they're so beautiful.

Man

Not as beautiful as you.

Woman

Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.

Man

Not as beautiful as-

+++++


The turkeys attack the couple, stripping their clothes off. Screams are heard as the turkeys overwhelm the couple.

+++++


King Jimmy's All You Can Eat Buffet. The price is right. The boys and their families are there with Marvin.

Stan

This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'

Cartman

Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.

+++++


The crowd laughs.

Cartman

Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?

+++++


A waiter places a plate of shrimp in front of Cartman.

Cartman

You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.

Marvin

Ap-ee-tizer.

Cartman

This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.

+++++


A waiter approaches with plates of ham, turkey, and drumsticks.

Cartman

Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers.

+++++


He tosses the plate of shrimp into a trash can. The shrimp don't make it in. He, Liane, and Stan work on the drumsticks, Randy slices into the turkey, and Kyle is slicing some ham for himself (!). Marvin reaches for a pot-pie on Cartman's plate.

Cartman

No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.

Stan

Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.

Cartman

Oh yeah, you're right.

+++++


eyes a slice of pie sitting before Marvin.

Cartman

Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man? [Heading to a whisper.] Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...

+++++


Mr. Garrison's Classroom.

Mr. Garrison

Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.

+++++


He reaches into the box of canned goods.

Mr. Garrison

And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?

+++++


The class stares back blankly.

Mr. Garrison

Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.

+++++


Silence. Mr. Garrison begins laughing.

Mr. Garrison

Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.

Stan

Yeah, yeah, we do!

Cartman

Yeah, that's right.

Kyle

We do!

Mr. Garrison

All right boys, show us what you've brought.

+++++


The boys walk to the front of the class with Marvin.

Kyle

This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin.

+++++


Marvin looks inside the food box.

Stan

He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.

+++++


Marvin pulls out a can of food.

+++++


Cartman takes it away and puts it back.

Cartman

No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.

+++++


Marvin takes it back out.

Cartman

No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!

Mr. Garrison

Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?

Stan

He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.

Mr. Garrison

The sports watch from the commercial?

Kyle

Yeah, that one.

Bebe

I want a Starvin' Marvin.

Clyde

Me too.

Pip

Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

Class

Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me.

Mr. Garrison

Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.

Kyle

Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.

+++++


Principal Victoria's Office.

Principal Victoria

Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.

+++++


She hangs up the phone and addresses the boys.

Principal Victoria

Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.

Stan

No.

Principal Victoria

You can't care for this child!

Kyle

But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.

Principal Victoria

Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.

Stan

So why can't he live here now?

Principal Victoria

Because he can't!

Kyle

Because why?

Principal Victoria

Because eight-year olds can't be parents!

Kyle

Then you take care of him.

Principal Victoria

[on the spot] I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy.

+++++


Silence.

Principal Victoria

I send my five dollars a month, see?

+++++


Demonstrating her Teiko watch.

Stan

This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.

Cartman

Oh well, back to the poor country with you.

Kyle

You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.

Cartman

B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.

+++++


Genetic Engineering Ranch.

Mephesto

I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.

Chef

Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.

Mephesto

Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.

Chef

Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.

Mephesto

Oh, whoops.

+++++


He quickly switches slides.

Mephesto

Now tell me what you see.

Chef

Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.

Mephesto

Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing.

Chef

What does it mean?

Mephesto

Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world.

Chef

Oh, fudge!

+++++


Chef ponders for a moment.

Chef

Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.

Mephesto

Sure.

+++++


He switches slides again.

+++++


Cartman's house. Marvin is sitting alone on the couch watching TV. Secret service agents enter the house. Outside, a helicopter flies around with its searchlight on.

Agent 1

Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch.

+++++


Marvin points towards Cartman's room. The agents go forth.

Cartman

Hey, hey, what's going on?!

+++++


The agents have him in a duffle bag and are dragging him out of the house.

Cartman

Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!

+++++


Returning to Marvin.

Agent 1

Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up.

Cartman

Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!

+++++


A truck door closes.

Marvin

Sweet.

+++++


Outside the Library.

Mayor McDaniels

So how does this thing work?

Aide

Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family.

Mayor McDaniels

POVVVV?

Aide

Poverty stricken citizen.

Mayor McDaniels

Ohhoho, brilliant.

+++++


A horde of turkeys rush the square and attack a fake turkey and a Pilgrim hat.

Mayor McDaniels

Daah!! What the hell is this!!

+++++


The turkeys go through the crowd attacking people.

Aide

I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program.

+++++


Mephesto joins them.

Mephesto

They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.

Chef

It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!

+++++


A platoon of turkeys march by.

Chef

Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!

Kyle

Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!

+++++


Mayor McDaniels, alarmed, steps up to the mic.

Mayor McDaniels

OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!

+++++


Jimbo and Ned enter, armed with rifles. They start firing away, and turkeys go down left and right.

Mephesto

We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!

+++++


Cartman's House. Marvin is taking up Cartman's habits. On TV, Terrance and Phillip are reenacting the first Thanksgiving.

Terrance

Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?

Phillip

Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.

+++++


Terrance attempts to squeeze one off.

Terrance

Huh, eh,

+++++


Phillip offers to help.

Terrance

wait wait wait.

+++++


He tries some more.

Terrance

Eh, eh.

+++++


And some more.

Terrance

Here it comes, ehhhh.

+++++


A long squeeky fart bursts forth.

Terrance

Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!

Phillip

Aaaah.

+++++


Laughter.

Phillip

I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.

+++++


Laughter.

Terrance

I spattered his face!

+++++


Laughter.

Phillip

Now he's a smelly Indian.

+++++


Laughter.

TV announcer

We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this.

Sally Struthers

Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.

+++++


Cartman walking around in the background.

Cartman

Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!

Sally Struthers

So please, call and adopt a child today.

Cartman

I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!

Liane

You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?

Marvin

Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof.

Liane

Okay.

Marvin

Sweet.

+++++


Ethiopian Desert. A vulture is flying overhead, awaiting its next meal to die.

Cartman

Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.

+++++


He approaches a group of Ethiopians.

Cartman

Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?

+++++


They stare back blankly.

Cartman

Well, screw you too!

+++++


Suddenly in a swarm of flies.

Cartman

What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!

+++++


He walks away.

+++++


The Library. The B and second R have slipped a bit.

Mayor McDaniels

All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa.

+++++


The crowd cheers.

Stan

Hey, where's Cartman?

Kyle

I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?

+++++


Marvin shrugs.

Mayor McDaniels

Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.

+++++


The crowd cheers.

Mayor McDaniels

Come on, hurry up.

+++++


Kenny enters the "Grab-O-Lux"

Carol McCormick

Grab a lot son.

Mayor McDaniels

Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!

+++++


Air is pumped in to raise the cans, but Kenny goes up as well and floats around. Status indicator flash on and off.

Mayor McDaniels

Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!

Stan, Kyle

Come on, Kenny!

+++++


Stuart waving his beer bottle.

Stuart McCormick

Come on, son!

Mayor McDaniels

Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family.

+++++


She switches off the Grab-o-lux with the remote control, and Kenny and the cans drop to the floor. He gets up and exits.

Mayor McDaniels

It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe.

+++++


The crowd cheers, but the sound of turkeys fills the air.

Chef

What the-?!

Stan

Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!

+++++


The turkeys charge over a hill.

Officer Barbrady

Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.

Mephesto

I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen.

+++++


Chef comes up and addresses the crown.

Chef

Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...

+++++


Chef looks down at Mephesto's companion, Kevin. The turkeys continue their attack.

Chef

What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?

Mephesto

That's not important right now.

Chef

No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.

Mayor McDaniels

Chef, the turkeys!

Chef

Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!

+++++


The turkeys continue their attack.

Chef

We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.

+++++


Ethiopian Desert. Cartman walks slowly.

Cartman

Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.

+++++


He sees a Red Cross van is in the distance. Ethiopians gather round it.

Cartman

Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!

+++++


He approaches the van.

Cartman

I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.

Red Cross dude

Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding.

+++++


The female partner is putting some things away.

Cartman

What?!

Red Cross dude

We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up.

Cartman

But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!

+++++


Now behind the van ready to leave.

Red Cross dude

Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch.

+++++


He tosses Cartman a watch and hops into the van. The van drives off.

Cartman

WEEEEEEAK!!!

+++++


In the woods near South Park. The screen is reduced to a wide screen format, so you know a movie reference is coming. The town is assembled for battle as the Mayor speaks.

Mayor McDaniels

People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys.

Townsperson 1

There's too many of them.

Mayor McDaniels

Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!

Townsperson 2

We can't stop them.

+++++


Chef rides up on a brown steed. His face is painted blue and white. He is wearing Scottish garb, wielding a sword and shield à la Braveheart.

Chef

 Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!

+++++


Now pumped for battle.

Crowd

Wooo, yeahhh, woo.

+++++


On a nearby hill the pack of turkeys is gathered together. One turkey is also painted in blue and white.

Leader turkey

Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!

+++++


The other turkeys gobble like mad, then sally forth. The town residents stand ready for battle as the turkeys descend into the valley.

Kyle

Here you go turkeys!

+++++


Kyle moons the turkey forces.

+++++


The town force descends, the mayor and an aide stay behind.

Mayor McDaniels

Does my hair look okay?

+++++


Ethiopian Desert. The vulture still circles...

Cartman

Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...

+++++


He looks up to the sky for relief.

Cartman

I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.

+++++


He falls forward to the ground. After a few seconds he lifts his head.

Cartman

Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.

+++++


He sees something. A lone building stands in the distance. Cartman approaches. A sign reads, "No Admittance".

Cartman

Huh, I wonder what's in here?

+++++


Cartman opens the door and faces towers of Cheesy Poofs, Snacky Cakes, Boogie Bars and Veal Roll-Ups. "Alleluyah" is playing. Cartman stands in awe, then is overjoyed.

Cartman

SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!

+++++


He rubs up against them lovingly. He sees a large-screen TV and a potted plant, and walks towards them. He then looks to his right and sees Sally Struthers feasting on some cake and two Ethiopians fanning her with palm fronds. She sees him and stops eating. Cartman is mad.

Cartman

Sally Struthers?!

Sally Struthers

Who the hell are you?!

Cartman

Gimme that cake!

Sally Struthers

Nooho, this is my cake!

Cartman

No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!

Sally Struthers

NOO! You can't have any!

Cartman

No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!

+++++


After some more whining he opens the door and sees some Ethiopians passing by.

Cartman

You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!

+++++


They turn to look at him.

Sally Struthers

Uh oh.

+++++


She just can't eat that cake fast enough.

+++++


South Park Forest. The battle continues. The turkeys fight valiently, but many are falling. Ike beheads a turkey. Marvin looks on and scratches his head.

Chef

Stay close children.

+++++


His shield blocks one turkey as he slays another.

Stan, Kyle, Kenny

Yeaaa!

+++++


The turkeys rush towards Kenny.

Kenny

(O-Oh.)

+++++


One turkey manages to extract Kenny's eyeball as the others kill him outright. They speed away with pieces of him.

Stan

Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!

Kyle

You bastards!

Jimbo

The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned.

+++++


Ned picks off the remaining three birds.

Stan

We did it!!

+++++


As the town celebrates, some townsfolk are still beating on the birds, one of them with a large mallet.

Mephesto

My God, what have we done?

Chef

We've saved Thanksgiving!

Mephesto

But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead.

Chef

Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.

Mephesto

As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-

Chef

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

+++++


Two secret service agents approach Chef and Barbrady, ignoring the carnage.

Agent 2

Excuse me sir, we're looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch.

Showing a picture of Marvin.

Agent 1

Have you seen anyone fitting this description.

Officer Barbrady

Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.

+++++


Marvin approaches the two agents.

Agent 1

There you are. Are you ready to go home now?

+++++


Marvin looks at Mr. Garrison, then at Chef, then at Officer Barbrady. He quickly shakes an affirmative. The agents lead him away, but he turns back to get some turkeys. Stan and Kyle look on as Kenny's corpse lies motionless behind them.

Stan

Wow, it sucks he has to leave.

Kyle

Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.

Stan

You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.

+++++


Kenny's head moves.

Stan

But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.

Kyle

Yeah.

+++++


A rat moves in and out of Kenny's empty eye socket, then scurries away.

Kyle

And that means that McGyver is a real person too.

+++++


Ethiopian Desert. Three Red Cross workers are present.

Red Cross Chick

We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.

Cartman

That's right you will, God-Damnit.

+++++


A male agent checks his watch.

Cartman

Move it POVs, I'm an American!

+++++


A plane lands. Marvin exits the plane.

Ethiopian

A baba, gluck gluck bababab ga.

Marvin

Baba gook gook ba.

+++++


The cargo door lowers in back of the plane and a bunch of dead turkeys fall out. The Ethiopians grab the turkeys and raise Marvin on their shoulders in triumph. They march away, passing by a spit on which Sally Struthers has been tied, with an apple in her mouth.

Sally Struthers

(What are you doing? Let me off of here!)

+++++


Kenny's House.

Stuart

Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us, and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.

Carol

Amen.

+++++


She takes a brief look around.

Carol

Does anybody have a can opener?

Stuart

God Damn-it.
