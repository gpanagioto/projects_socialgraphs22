I've joined a social awareness group. It's a coalition that discourages the use of ... words that have negative or offensive connotations... to grant respect to people who are victims of unfair stereotypes. We've been getting away with horrible things, Sharon. Having- laughs at less privileged people and thinking it was harmless. Our group is... trying to be a civilizing influence... where we discuss and have meetings to better define and reinforce tolerance and acceptance  of all groups of people. Uhhhh... They serve refreshments, yes. I'm sorry, I don't know what that is. You want me to shame Brett Favre?  Did I check his privilege? Yes. I had some refreshments and I checked your friend's privilege. Stan, straight white males in a capitalistic society have little- understanding of victimization compared to injustices against the underprivileged. Dicks on your face is a very first-world problem.  <poem><i>Woowoo!</i></poem> Ow, hot. Hot hot, hothohhht.  Ahhh. So I'm PC now? Oh wow. Oakleys!
