Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders!  Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!  Ungh, gay, dude. You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver. He's right. We have to take a hard stance ''right now'' and establish that ''we're'' the dominant ones in this relationship!  ...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses. Together we are strong!  Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom? Holy God, dude! Yeah!  And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at. I just didn't think it would come so soon. Huh? Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was. How? Oh yeah, time travel. Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement. So can you do it? I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls! Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him! Come on!  What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!  No?? Oh no! What have we done?! What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one! Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up! Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing? Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science! Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either. Yeah! You suck, Cartman!  Hey, Timmy's back!
