Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay? No, sorry. Now,  A Penn State administrator walks into a bar. Where's that smile? How about this one? Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station. Come on, that's a good one. Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services.  I just need to get some information from you if that's okay. Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab. And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here. We just - no, we just like to have fun here. What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny? Could be worse. Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?  Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!  Oh! Oh, and "your momma" jokes are better?! They've been around since the '50s! Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda? It's my business because Child Protective Services is accountable for these kids!  Have I given you my head shot? Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink? Excuse me!  Let's have a look around. Oh my God.  What's going on here?  It's not funny! No, no, take all these kids back to their parents! We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of! It's like a Penn State homecoming party!
