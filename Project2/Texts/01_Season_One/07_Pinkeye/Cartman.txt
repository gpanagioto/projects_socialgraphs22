What the hell is that thing? There's no such thing as UFOs. Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass. Hey, dudes. It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil. My mom made it, isn't it cool? What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody? Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off! Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage. I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny! I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung! Poor piece of crap. There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh? You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!  Wookies don't live on Endor. What?! What did you say? Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you. Eating Kenny's pudding. Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself. That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool. My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil! Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o. Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!  Could I see that again? That was cool. I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.  I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost! Boo! I'm a ghost. Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad. Hey Chef. Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh? What is that? Who? Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him. Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master. Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking. God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!! Check. Yeah, granola pisses me off. Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny. Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire. I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!! I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate. Hi Wendy. You what?! Are you insane?! How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks? Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy. You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole! Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people! Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too. One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards! Can we have some candy now please?! I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit! Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy! Aaah! It was Kyle. Remember candy, focus on the candy. Eh, shit... You guys, shit... It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now! Hey, there's a pay phone! Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it! Aaah, kew! Finish her dude, she's a zombie now! Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest? Kill her Stan! Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on! Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. Well, let's go home, start eating that candy. Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money. Lehh, eh, screw you guys!
