==Fictional character biography==
===Uno===
Uno is raised from childhood by a secret organization named the Q Society to be the champion of the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] to battle their enemy, the Aztec god [[Tezcatlipoca (DC Comics)|Tezcatlipoca]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=23}}</ref> He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities, complementing Uno's peak human mental and physical abilities.<ref name="dc-ency"/> After his training is completed, he enters the United States and assumes the identity of recently deceased physician Curt Falconer.<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #1 (August 1996)</ref>

Aztek later joins the [[Justice League]],<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)</ref> but resigns when it is revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society is [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''JLA'' #15 (February 1998)</ref> He is later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine Mageddon (apparently the Tezcatlipoca that the cult was referring to all along). Aztek ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] story arc.<ref>''JLA'' #41 (May 2000)</ref>

===Nayeli Constant===
A new version of the character appeared in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' vol. 5 #20; instead of being Uno/Curt Falconer, the new hero is Nayeli Constant. She was a [[software engineer]] in [[Austin, Texas]] who was startled by the Aztek helmet bursting into her window and telling her about the millennia-long war against the dark god Tezcatlipoca. She decided to accept the role of the new Aztek and modified the armor to suit her purposes; eventually finding her way to Vanity after The Ray left the city to join the Justice League of America. When he returned from a mission, the two encountered one another and briefly argued about who should protect the citizens of Vanity but they teamed up to stop a criminal and decided that the city could use both heroes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-aztek-rebirth/|title=Justice League of America: Aztek to Make Rebirth Debut|date=8 October 2017|website=Cbr.com|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning. He wears an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a "four-dimensional mirror"), from which he derives flight, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels. The helmet could feed information directly into his brain even after he was blinded in his first confrontation with Mageddon. The four-dimensional power source could self-destruct in a highly explosive manner.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions==
===The Rock of Ages===
Another version of Aztek, with the same abilities, known as '''Azteka''' was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during "''The Rock of Ages''" storyline in which the JLA traveled to an alternate future overrun by [[Darkseid]]. She sacrifices her life to destroy Darkseid's lunar facilities.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Aztek appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', mostly appearing in brief cameos throughout the series. After making a very brief appearance in "Question Authority" (voiced by Chris Cox), he made a more significant appearance in "I Am Legion" (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) where he helped Superman and [[Shayera Hol]] investigate where Lex Luthor had gone after escaping prison. Superman asked Aztek to scan the scene to see if he could find out where Luthor went, but had no luck after finishing his scan. [[King Faraday]] then appeared behind the trio and introduced himself to Aztek.
