== Concept and creation ==
Wen was cast as May in October 2012.<ref name="Oct2012MingNa" /> Whedon had the character, who was originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets,<ref name="Oct2012TVline" /> "rolling around in his head" for a long time.<ref name="WenHitFix" /> In preparation for the role, Wen was "given a couple of background stories" about May, but found it challenging to play a character who is respected by those around her when the audience doesn't know why, stating "It's a challenge in different ways....I use some of my own personal experience where we've been scarred or we've been greatly disappointed".<ref name="WenHitFix" /> When May's past was revealed in "[[Melinda (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Melinda]]", Wen called it "devastating", explaining "She was married, she was in love with Andrew, she had a job that she excelled at and loved and believed in—so her world was pretty perfect...To have learned what she had to do, for the good of the many...I can understand why it would traumatize her so much and cause her to retreat."<ref name="WenMelinda" /> The character is of Chinese descent, like the actress portraying her,<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 6, 2016 |title=The rise of racially diverse superheroes |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/guide/article/2016/06/02/rise-racially-diverse-superheroes |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190820114030/https://www.sbs.com.au/guide/article/2016/06/02/rise-racially-diverse-superheroes |archive-date=August 20, 2019 |access-date=August 20, 2019 |website=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]}}</ref> although she was not written that way.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lau |first=Tandy |date=August 2, 2019 |title=Meet Marvel's Asians of S.H.I.E.L.D. |url=https://charactermedia.com/meet-marvels-asians-of-s-h-i-e-l-d/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190820113424/https://charactermedia.com/meet-marvels-asians-of-s-h-i-e-l-d/ |archive-date=August 20, 2019 |access-date=August 20, 2019 |website=Character Media}}</ref> May's shirt is the same blue as many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' such as [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]], so as to have some continuity between her uniform and those established in the films. The rest of her costume is inspired by military flight suits, including a leather vest, and pants with stretch panels to aid with fighting.<ref name="FoleyTyranny" />

== Characterization ==
Following the series premiere, Wen teased the character, saying that "she's very much the observer, and whenever she wants to put in her two cents, it's something that you want to listen to and kind of pay attention to...She's slow in getting acclimated to part of the group and being in the field again."<ref name="WenZap2it" /> Talking about May's reasons for staying with S.H.I.E.L.D., Wen explained "May's friendship and...loyalty and her love for Coulson [keeps her there]. Maybe not romantic [love], it's just really—it's hard to describe—it's a bond, it's unbreakable, and she will watch over Coulson and take care of him and help him through whatever he needs to at this point in his life... She wants to be there for him, and if it serves S.H.I.E.L.D., that's just more or less a side effect, really."<ref name="WenRebuilding" /> Wen admitted that May develops a relationship with Skye over the course of the series, going from thinking of Skye as "someone that she didn't want as part of the team and didn't understand why Coulson wanted her" to wanting Skye "to be the best agent that she can be." After discovering that Skye is an Inhuman, Wen stated that "it's like when you have your child or your daughter losing control or getting involved with situations or people that you’re not sure about. You don't have the control anymore. It's very frightening. For Skye to be an unknown entity, May still holds out hope. She hopes that her training with her will help her be able to control her new powers, but you never know. Sometimes the power overtakes everything else."<ref name="WenSkyeInhuman" />

On how May deals with her ex-husband Andrew becoming the Inhuman killer Lash, Wen said, "She's come to the understanding that it was something he had no control over. The betrayal might be not sharing that information of what happened to him with her. I think she understands that, in a way, he was scared and trying to be protective of their relationship and doing it all for the wrong reasons. I think, ultimately, Agent May is kind of shut down when it comes to Lash and Andrew at this point. That's why she's re-focusing all her energy back into S.H.I.E.L.D., back being by Coulson's side. That's where she's most comfortable."<ref name="IGN10Teasers" /> Wen went on to describe May as "unconventionally maternal...she's taking care of Simmons and really believing that she needs to be able to protect herself, she's very, very concerned about the family's well being."<ref name="CBRTakingCharge" />

== Reception ==
Wen received nominations for 'Favorite Actress in a New TV Series' at the [[40th People's Choice Awards]] and 'Favorite Female TV Star&nbsp;– Family Show' at the [[2016 Kids' Choice Awards|29th Kids' Choice Awards]].<ref name="40thPeoplesChoice" /><ref name="29thKidsChoice" /> Wen was also named [[TVLine]]'s "Performer of the Week" for the week of April 12, 2015, for her performance in "Melinda", specifically her portrayal of May in the flashback sequences.<ref name="WenTVLinePerformer" />
