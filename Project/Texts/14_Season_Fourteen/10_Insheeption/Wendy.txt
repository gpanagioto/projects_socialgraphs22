Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.  Stan? We need to talk about your locker.  Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.  It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker. No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help, I don't know how much longer I could be with you! Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan. Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
