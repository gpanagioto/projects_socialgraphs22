Ye Yeah-ha. Mmmmm.  Come on, babe. How long have we known each other? And I still don't get any action. But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old. Mmmmm  Beat it, chubby! Mmmmm  Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room.   I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them.  I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar. When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff. Mmmmm.  Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice.  Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!  ''Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.'' <poem><i>Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly</i></poem> Ey, shut up, tubby! Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly? O-kay, why don't you sing it for us? Hey man, don't be shy. <poem><i>Don't you know? Isn't...</i></poem> Shut up!  You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said!  Yeah! Come on! Give it up! Give it up, babe! Come on, babih! Why the hell not?! You're not putting out for me?

Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta! What the hell is this?! Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot.  Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?  No clothes, right. Right here, Miss Hayek! What the?
