==Publication history==
Calendar Man first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #259 (September 1958) and was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last= Wallace|first = Daniel|contribution = Calendar Man|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 65|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place= New York|year= 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> He returned after twenty years to plague Batman again in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #312 (June 1979).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |last2=Kronenberg |first2=Michael |title=The Batcave Companion |date=2009 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1893905788 |page=220}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Criminal career===
Calendar Man is fascinated by dates and calendars.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=58}}</ref> His crimes always have a relationship to the date that they are committed. The theme may be related to what day of the week it is or to a holiday or to a special anniversary on that date; he will plan his crime around that day. He often wears different costumes which correspond to the significance of the date, though he does have a main costume which has various numbers (meant to represent days on a calendar) sprouting from the shoulders.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He next appears in ''[[Batman]]'' #312 (June 1979), in which his crimes are based on the days of the week, and his costumes reflect the [[Norse Mythology|Norse]] and [[Roman Mythology|Roman]] gods they were named for, e.g. [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. Calendar Man fires an ultrasonic sound weapon at Batman, nearly killing him. While Batman recuperates, Calendar Man commits crimes on Friday and Saturday. He plans to leave [[Gotham City]] on a train called the Western Sun Express on Sunday -- the traditional "day of rest" --knowing that the police would be waiting for him to attempt to steal an artifact of the Egyptian god of the Sun, [[Ra]]. Batman captures him at the train station before he boards.

This issue also marked the first appearance of his most commonly known "calendar cape" costume. His next appearance in ''[[Batman]]'' #384–385 (June–July 1985) and ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #551 (June 1985), sees the Calendar Man at the onset of the Crisis being used as a pawn of the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] in an attempt to find an assassin to eliminate Batman. In this instance, the Calendar Man's theme is holidays, and he attempts to use the young [[Jason Todd]], as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], as the Batman's Achilles' heel, with the promise of his demise on the first day of Spring. Ultimately, however, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] himself captures the villain.

His best-known modern appearance is in the miniseries ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', where he is portrayed as a [[Hannibal Lecter]]-like figure, offering insight in Batman's search for [[Holiday (comics)|Holiday]], a [[serial killer]] who uses holidays as his ''modus operandi''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/03/the-best-worst-batman-villains|title=The Best & Worst Batman Villains|work=ign.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/batman-movie-villains-list-discussion-scott-176844/8/|title=15 Batman Villains That Deserve Their Movie Due|work=[[Screen Rant]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718061433/http://screenrant.com/batman-movie-villains-list-discussion-scott-176844/8/|archive-date=2015-07-18}}</ref> Like Lecter in the novels of [[Thomas Harris]], Calendar Man knows who the killer is and keeps this information to himself, choosing instead to taunt the heroes with cryptic clues. He returns in that story's sequel, ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', in which he impersonates deceased mobster [[Carmine Falcone]] in an effort to drive his children, [[Alberto Falcone|Alberto]] and [[Mario Falcone (DC Comics)|Mario]], insane. When Calendar Man (as Carmine) tries to get Alberto to kill himself, however, the younger Falcone detects the ruse; Alberto knows that his father abhorred suicide, and thus figures out that Calendar Man is manipulating him. At the end of the story arc, Falcone's daughter [[Sofia Falcone Gigante]] beats him to a pulp as revenge for his role in her father's death. In both stories, Calendar Man is bitter that the new murderous rogues have taken the attention off him; he fears that he is being forgotten.

Calendar Man teams up with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Killer Moth]] as part of The Misfits, a group of villains trying to prove themselves in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7–9 (1992–1993).<ref name="dc-ency"/> Also, he is among the [[Arkham Asylum]] inmates freed by [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] in ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'', but he is easily recaptured by [[Power Girl]] shortly after his escape. In ''[[Team Titans]]'' #14 (Nov 1993) Calendar Man and several other villains whose crimes center on time-based motifs, including [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]], fight the title's heroes over a valued hourglass.<ref>''[[Team Titans]]'' #14 (Nov 1993)</ref> Calendar Man appears in "All the Deadly Days", a story in ''80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition'' #3 (July 2000), in which he has acquired a new high-tech costume, and moves up to more grandiose crimes.<ref>''80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition'' #3 (July 2000)</ref> He makes an appearance in the alternate reality story "Superman: Arkham" (beginning in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #160), which was also written by Jeph Loeb.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #160</ref> Calendar Man appears in the series ''[[Harley Quinn]]'', as an inside informant to the title character.{{issue|date=June 2017}}

In Week 20 of the weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a radio broadcasts a message saying that Calendar Man was left tied up for the cops in Gotham City, even though there is no Batman. It is revealed the new heroine, [[Batwoman]], was responsible for his capture.<ref>''52'' Week Twenty. DC Comics.</ref>

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the character appears as a lifestyle reporter in a series of backup stories called "Channel 52". In one, he claims to have kept up a video diary out of scavenged materials because basic human civilization has fallen.<ref>Phegley, Kiel (January 29, 2013). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=43436 "DC Spreads The Word With "Channel 52""]. [[Comic Book Resources]].</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
In [[DC Rebirth]], Calendar Man is a permanent inmate of Arkham Asylum. When Batman hid [[Psycho-Pirate]] in Arkham, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] came for him and tore through the asylum and defeated all its inmates, who Batman had freed to weaken Bane. Eventually, Bane confronted Calendar Man, but instead of fighting him, Calendar Man stated that everything was just a loop and that all of this was pointless as Bane would never win.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 3) #19</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Calendar Man is a successful inventor, capable of designing the machinery needed to deploy his various schemes. His talents aid him as he pursues his obsession with quirks of the calendar, carefully planning and theming his crimes around [[holidays]], [[weekdays]] and the [[season]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 1: Batman |date=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co |isbn=0-02-538700-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco01flei/page/154/mode/2up |access-date=29 March 2020 |page=155}}</ref> Calendar Man is also an experienced hand-to-hand combatant, although his main reason for his success is his intelligence. In his latest incarnation, as written by Scott Snyder and Tom King in the pages of the ''Batman Rebirth'' special (June 2016), the Calendar Man now ages with the seasonal weather of Gotham City.  Every spring he is reborn, with his DNA altered, but retains his memories, and then ages rapidly until winter when he dies, only to be reborn again the next spring by crawling from the husk of his own corpse.<ref>''Batman: Rebirth'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===

He then gave the exhausted Batman a list of names and told him that those people had been poisoned and had 24 hours to live. He instructed Batman to save them all and then return to him. If Batman failed to save all of the people on the list or brought any of his allies with him when he returned, Calendar Man would execute the baby.<ref>''Batman: Arkham Knight'' #30</ref> The listed citizens were saved but before Batman returned as ordered, [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] visited Julian to dissuade him of his attempt to kill Batman. Grudgingly, Calendar Man relented and gave up the baby without a fight.<ref>''Batman: Arkham Knight'' #31-32</ref>

===''Injustice 2''===
In the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Calendar Man is shown to be a member of this universe's [[Suicide Squad]].<ref>''Injustice 2'' #1</ref> When the Impostor Batman (a revived [[Jason Todd]] in disguise) takes over the Suicide Squad, he deems Calendar Man useless and tries to blow him up with other villains he found worthless, but Calendar Man was lucky for the bomb on his neck was defective.
