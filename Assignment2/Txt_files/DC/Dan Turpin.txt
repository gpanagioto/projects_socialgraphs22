==Fictional character biography==
In Turpin's first appearance he is one of the few citizens of Metropolis aware that a secretive war is taking place in the city between super-powered beings. When this war turns violent, Turpin's boss tries to take him off the case, but Turpin ignores him. Turpin leads the fight against the rampaging [[Kalibak]], using the energy of the entire city to assist Lightray and Orion in defeating him. Turpin suffers multiple injuries but survives.<ref>''The New Gods'' #8 (April 1972)</ref>

He keeps his job and becomes Lieutenant Inspector of the [[Metropolis (comics)#Metropolis Police Department|Metropolis Special Crimes Unit]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=447}}</ref> In the third  ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' series, Turpin is sent to [[Hawaii]] to investigate whether or not they needed a Special Crimes Unit of their own. While initially skeptical, a visit from the violent [[Darkseid]] faction, the [[Female Furies]] convinces Turpin that the islands need an SCU.{{efn|As seen in ''Superboy'' vol. 3 #20 (October 1995).}} In current ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' titles, Turpin is extremely loyal to [[Maggie Sawyer|Inspector Sawyer]], before her transfer to [[Gotham City]]. His romantic feelings for her fall apart when he learns she is a [[lesbian]]. Turpin has a daughter named Maisie.

He has spent a long time fighting threats in Metropolis; such as the rampaging group of mutants called the 'Underworlders'.<ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #499 (1993). DC Comics.</ref>

Turpin returns in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #1 (May 2008). He had been called back from retirement to investigate the case of several missing kids; this evolves into investigating the death of the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. Orion passes on several cryptic phrases to Turpin, telling him that "He is in you all!" before finally passing away.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

In the second issue, he follows clues given to him by [[Renee Montoya]] and [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|The Mad Hatter]], investigating [[The Dark Side Club]] and journeying to the devastated city of [[Bl√ºdhaven]]. There he meets up with [[Glorious Godfrey|Reverend Good]], and begins to realize that "there's [[Darkseid|someone in my head]]".<ref>''Final Crisis'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

In the fourth issue, Turpin, after much inner struggle, is turned into the new host body for Darkseid; Darkseid later reveals that he selected Turpin rather than Batman as a host because Batman would have resisted longer than he wished, while Turpin struggled just enough to make his victory sweeter.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #4. DC Comics.</ref>

In the sixth issue, [[Batman]] uses a gun loaded with a Radion bullet, which is poisonous to the New Gods, to shoot Darkseid in the shoulder. [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]], managing to outrun the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] - currently after Barry - so that it takes the currently-weakened Darkseid during a confrontation with Superman. After Darkseid is claimed by the Black Racer, Turpin is reverted to normal and regains control over his body, breathing "In us... in all of us..." in apparent recognition of the meaning of Orion's last words.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #6.
