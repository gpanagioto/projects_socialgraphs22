Eh. You're making me sick, dude. No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park. Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester! I'll put a dollar on Sylvester. Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass. Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay. That dog is a gay homosexual. <poem><i>Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.</i></poem> What's homecoming? There he goes again. Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual. ...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television. Ah, dammit! Eeyy! Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-? That's not fair! Stupid puppet. You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass. Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog. Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen. He still looks pretty gay to me. There he goes! No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France. Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass! Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow! Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow! We'll just see about that. No I didn't. That was just my shoes. That's right, you get back there. Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.
