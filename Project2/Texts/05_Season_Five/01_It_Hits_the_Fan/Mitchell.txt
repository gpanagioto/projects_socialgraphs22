I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped! Maybe... maybe protect them from you? And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too! That's it, I've had enough of this. I said, enough! Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop. You're right. Maybe I'll see you around. Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks.
