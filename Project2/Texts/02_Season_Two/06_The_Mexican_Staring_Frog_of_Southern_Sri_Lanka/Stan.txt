Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam. No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there. Whoa! Wow! "...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp." "Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster." "...and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride." "So was the horror of Vietnam." The end. From Vietnam veterans. No, no, we didn't-- Bu-but we're not making it up, it was-- For ''what'', dude? Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth? How? Well, what do you mean? Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses. Yeah. Ready, you guys? Okay. Action! Cut! Cartman! It's supposed to be a frog! Since when do frogs talk, Cartman? Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman? Action! Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you. Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way, then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared. It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready? Good. A-and action! They deserve it for lying to us, dude. They're here! Hurry and hide! Holy crap, dude. Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real! Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out! We shot all those videos and sent them in. Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody. Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying! Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. You big piece of crap! Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny! W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself. Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie! No, your producer did. She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs. During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie! W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
