 And it is time to go to work!  Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this. This is the ''fourth grade''! You need to grow up!  Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.  SILENCE! Principal Victoria, I would like a word!  My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across! One of them is mentally ''handicapped'', for Christ's sake! The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?!  Why?! Where did he go?! But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with  God as my witness- I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top!  I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!  Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.  I said, pass your papers to the fronteh! It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention! What are you doing?! Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do! Children! Children, come back here! I HAVE HAD IT!!! These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison!  What in God's name happened to him? And, nobody has found him? I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison ''myself''! Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up!  What? Hello-oo-ooo.  Mister? Mr. Garrison? I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help.  Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how ''you'' taught them. Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope! Choksondik. Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children! ...Done. "Children, we are now going to do math problems." "Uuh! Ah, you ''will'' do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!" "Don't use that kind of language, young man!"  No?? Oh. Pre-sent them? I'm ready. I'm not afraid. What lives inside? Oh, alrighty.  Alright, children, I hope you all did your-   Oh Good Gravy, not this again. Children, I will have order!! Children, get back into your seats! Eric, I mean it!  You said, "suck my balls." Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em. Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets ''harder'' as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand? Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade.
