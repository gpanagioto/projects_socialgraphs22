==Fictional character biography==
Unwilling to hire another [[secretary]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] created an artificial one in the form of an artificial intelligence named F.R.I.D.A.Y. who manifested as the hologram of a young girl.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #53. Marvel Comics.</ref>

F.R.I.D.A.Y. became angry when Stark stopped using her. Hijacking some [[Iron Man's armors|Iron Man armors]], F.R.I.D.A.Y. kidnapped [[Pepper Potts]]. Iron Man tracked her to Stark Industries' Coney Island Facility where he dispatched the controlled Iron Man armors and a hologram of [[Fin Fang Foom]]. Iron Man reasoned with F.R.I.D.A.Y. when Pepper noted that F.R.I.D.A.Y. had a crush on Tony. Tony then grounded her to the [[Baxter Building]] under [[Edwin Jarvis]]'s observation while she spent a month calculating [[pi]].<ref>''Iron Man: Iron Protocols'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]," F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s holographic appearance was replaced by that of a young woman when Tony Stark started using her again.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tony Stark later removed F.R.I.D.A.Y. from his armor and placed her into a robot body of her own.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when Tony Stark established the eScape, F.R.I.D.A.Y. helped him to deal with its A.I. called Motherboard only to be deleted. Motherboard even tried to impersonate F.R.I.D.A.Y. in order to deal with Tony.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Motherboard was defeated and the eScape was shut down, [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] persuaded Tony not to make a back-up program of F.R.I.D.A.Y. as she would be a different entity.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" event, F.R.I.D.A.Y. was revealed to have been reborn when Tony Stark, in his Mark One form, recreated the escape as the Thirteenth Floor for the A.I. Army to use. She is revealed to have pulled Mark One's conscious into the virtual environment before he crashed to the ground. F.R.I.D.A.Y revealed to Mark One that she has been operating as "Ghost in the Machine" to aid the A.I. Army and has also manipulated [[Bethany Cabe]] to have Rescue obtain DNA samples from Amanda Armstrong and Jude in order to restore Tony.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
