 Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go. Wuh well, sure.  Wull what is it? Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend. Not working out? Well, but ah I can get better. Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together. Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.  Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos!  Hu-uh, okay Mom.  I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me!  Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos!  Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!   It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order at Bennigan's. Yeh, you didn't?  Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?    So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?! Ms. Choksondik? Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.  Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand!  Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there. Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail. It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  Aaahhh! A note? Okay, Mom.  We haven't much time!  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos. Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  come back minions. Join me? But why? Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red. Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray. Now let us go look for my minions!  People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my final Labor of Loathing! I am going to... flood... the world! Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time. Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete. Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!  but now they have left me with no other choice! This is it, General Disarray. My final solution.  Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!
