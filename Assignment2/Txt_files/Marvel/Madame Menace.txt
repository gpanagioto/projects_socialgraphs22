==Fictional character biography==
Sunset Bain got her start by seducing fellow [[MIT]] undergraduate [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] into revealing the security codes for Stark Industries. Shortly thereafter, a force of masked men invaded and stole several prototypes. Within a year, '''Baintronics''' was founded and Sunset broke it off with Stark. While Baintronic maintained a spotless reputation, Sunset assumed the '''Madame Menace''' persona and sold high-tech weaponry to criminals via "a tremendously profitable underground seasonal "Sharper Villain" catalog of armaments."{{issue|date=March 2015}}

When Machine Man lost an arm while fighting [[Baron Brimstone]] and the Satan Squad, Madame Menace bought it, obtaining a low price by threatening the seller "with one of her flesh-eating roaches."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/bainsuns.htm|title = Sunset Bain (Madame Menace, Machine Man/Iron Man character)}}</ref> Her plans for [[reverse engineering]] the limb were interrupted when [[Machine Man]] came to claim it.

Sunset next showed up in a meeting with Tony Stark which was interrupted when a damaged Machine Man showed up with the head of [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], having lost a battle to [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]]. Stark changed into Iron Man and brought the damaged androids to Baintronics, where under the guise of assistance, Sunset created knockoff duplicates of the robots.<ref>''Iron Man'' Annual #11.

After this, Sunset as Madame Menace teamed with the [[New Enforcers]] in their plot to take over the fallen [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s crime cartel  Ostensibly, Bain did this in order to study the New Enforcers technology, including [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]], [[Dreadnought (comics)|Dreadnought]] and the [[Super-Adaptoid]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #99-100. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Having failed to decode the intricacies of Jocasta's A.I., Sunset decided to hire Tony Stark to investigate. As Stark was already employed otherwise, Sunset hired the new War Machine to destroy his current employers. After Iron Man defeated [[Fin Fang Foom]], Baintronics took the contract for transporting the beast's massive bulk. Using this as an in, Sunset asked Tony to work for her again. Growing suspicious, Stark accepted in order to learn more. Stark then freed Jocasta and persuaded the new War Machine to stop working for Sunset Bain.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #11-12 & 18-20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Sunset hired [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] to sabotage a Stark Enterprises operation. In lieu of paying him, she betrayed him to the police. In retaliation, the Taskmaster instigated a war between the [[Triad society|Triads]] and Baintronics. He even managed to shoot Sunset in the shoulder. As of the end of the mini-series, the hostilities between the two were unresolved, but aside from their enmity, the status quo was mostly restored.<ref>''Taskmaster'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She was shot several times by the [[Punisher]],<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #17 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> but has since resurfaced as an opponent of Machine Man again.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #8 (2008)</ref>

At Bain Tower, Sunset is approached by Dr. Bhang and his cat Dr. Shapiro on wanting to see Jocasta where they are denied. She takes the translation collar that is the actual Dr. Shapiro claiming that the A.I. Army would take control of it.

Army from acquiring new members much to the dismay of Machine Man.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In Sunset Bain's helicopter, Dr. Andrew Bhang informs Sunset Bain that the robots like animatronic mascots and room-bots are protesting on the streets. While stating that they are heading to Baintronics to tear it down, Sunset Bain figures out that Dr. Bhang is the A.I. Army's mole where he has been feeding information to Bethany Cabe who has been feeding it to Mark One. Dr. Bhang admits to Sunset Bain that he is just helping the A.I. Army because of the robot slavery. She has Dr. Bhang deposited on the roof where his stuff is while fire him as she vows that he will not work in this sector again.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #3.

==Powers and abilities==
Sunset is a genius-level inventor; she controls the resources of Baintronics and other smaller companies, as well as a small army of uniformed criminal hirelings. She rarely uses her inventions herself, preferring to sell them.

==Sunset Bain A.I.==
During the [[Christos Gage]] and [[Dan Slott]] "Iron Man 2020" arc, Arno Stark created an A.I. version of Sunset Bain when he had to fix a tiny scar on her face as she is shown the real Sunset Bain's body in one of the stasis pods.<ref name="Iron Man 2020 #4"/> The Sunset Bain A.I. states to Dr. Shapiro that her real counterpart became rich operating as Madame Menace as she disintegrates the real Sunset Bain stating how she dislikes competition. When she suspects that she frightened Dr. Shapiro, the Sunset Bain A.I. finds that Dr. Shapiro is the real mole and not as dumb as she thought as an Iron Legion states that their security system is down. As Rescue leads the attack on Stark Unlimited, Jocasta downloads the same protection program used on her into the Sunset Bain A.I. in order for her to get the Iron Legion to stand down.<ref name="Iron Man 2020 #5"/> In Washington DC sometime after Tony and Arno thwarted the Extinction Entity, Chairman Brickman is informed by the Sunset Bain A.I. that all the events were caused by her to make Baintronics a world power as she turns herself over to the authorities. At the Uncanny Valley Robot Bar, Machine Man and Jocasta were shown to have controlled the Sunset Bain A.I. into taking the blame.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===Earth-8410===
An older Sunset was Machine Man's adversary in his [[cyberpunk]] mini-series set in the year 2020. She was still the head of Baintronics, which had leveraged the tech from Machine Man and Jocasta in order to become the predominant [[megacorporation]] of its day. Through a robot's mistake, Machine Man was freed and fought back against Baintronics. Machine Man was able to defeat [[Iron Man 2020]] along with Sunset's other guards. Despite being 40 years past her prime, Sunset still was lively enough to attack Machine Man herself with a live power cable. Machine Man overcame even this and extracted a promise from Bain to leave him and his friends alone.
