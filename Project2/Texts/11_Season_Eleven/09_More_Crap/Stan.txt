No way! No, never.  Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready. Gee, thanks a lot, Dad. You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand.  Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please? Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap. That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one? Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for ''anything''. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most ''Sports Illustrated'' subscriptions sold.  Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off? All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2. Agh! I take it back! You're not number two! What is wrong with that guy? What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?! So Bono's newest record ''is'' a lie! So? He's the record.  Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours. Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record! Dude. That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit. Dad, are you all right?
