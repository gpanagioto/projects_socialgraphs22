Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!  Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go! I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  WHAT THE HELL?! Kenny, when did you get here? Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line. Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out! YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!  JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!!! ''(looking bored)'' Fags!  Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the ''man''? Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?  Yes! Well... well then he's NOT alive. That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar? Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube. Um, it was um, this one time... Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this! Did so! Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right. I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF. That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.  He's right in here. That's right. Respect our authoritah. I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato! You say Kenny, but I say tomato!  What?
