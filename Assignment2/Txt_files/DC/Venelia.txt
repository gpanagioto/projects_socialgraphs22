==Publication history==
===Pre-Crisis (1941–1987)===
When Wonder Woman's homeland is first introduced in 1941, it is referred to as Paradise Island, a secret and hidden island on Earth inhabited by the Amazons of myth. The Amazons were given a break from the hostilities and temptations of Man's World, and so were decreed to start a new life-improving themselves by sequestering themselves to this island away from [[ancient Greece]], after being enslaved by [[Hercules]]. With the island blessed by the [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Olympian Gods]], no man was allowed to physically set foot on it. When [[United States Army]] intelligence officer [[Steve Trevor]]'s plane crashes there during [[World War II]], he is nursed back to health just outside of the capital city by Princess Diana, daughter of the island's [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]]. Diana later competes against other Amazons to become Wonder Woman, the emissary from Paradise Island who will accompany Steve back to "Man's World" and aid in the fight against the [[Axis powers]]. It was established that all Amazons are adept at a discipline called "bullets and bracelets" in which they can deflect bullets fired at them using the chain bands on their wrists.

It was originally implied, but not yet fully confirmed, that Paradise Island was located somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Then in the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|1970s television incarnation]] (as portrayed by Lynda Carter), Paradise Island's location was set in the Bermuda Triangle. And the [[Wonder Woman (2009 film)|2009 animated movie version]] had set it in the [[Aegean Sea]].

Originally, there were three generations of Amazons living on the island, with Princess Diana being from the second.

This basic [[back-story]] remains intact throughout the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] and [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], until the 1985–1986 "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]" storyline. Upon the conclusion of this [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], most characters in the DC Comics universe underwent some revamp or [[retcon]] in their storyline history, and Wonder Woman was one of several characters whose entire continuity was [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].

===Post-Crisis (1987–present)===
The 1987 relaunch of the ''Wonder Woman'' series establishes that the Amazons are the reincarnated souls of women slain throughout pre-history by men. Shaped from clay over 3,000 years previous and given new lives by five Olympian goddesses — [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], and [[Aphrodite]] — the Amazons are granted immortality, great physical strength, highly acute senses, beauty, wisdom, and love for one another. They are tasked to teach the merits of virtue, love, and equality to the men of "Patriarch’s World".<ref name="ww1">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> They have founded the [[city-state]] of Themyscira in ancient Greece – Modern day [[Turkey]],<ref name="ww3641">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #36 and 41</ref> which is ruled by sisters Hippolyta and [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]]. [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], the God of War and a chief opponent of the Amazons, manipulates his half brother [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]] to gather forces and attack Themyscira. Heracles subdues and ravages Hippolyta, and his forces succeed in ransacking Themyscira and making the Amazons their slaves. Hippolyta pleads with the goddesses for help. Athena agrees to aid the Amazons, but only if they do not go against their purpose of creation by seeking revenge. When they agree to her terms, Athena frees the Amazons from their chains. Once freed, however, the Amazons proceed to slaughter most of their captors. Antiope leads a force of Amazons off into Greece, seeking vengeance on Heracles. As decreed by the goddesses, Hippolyta leads the remaining Amazons to a remote island where, as penance for their failures as teachers, they become guardians of Doom's Doorway, preventing the escape of the monsters beneath. Renaming the island paradise Themyscira after their fallen capital, the Amazons began their new lives, erecting buildings and monuments and perfecting their skills as artisans and warriors.

For centuries, the Amazons of Themyscira live in a perfect state of harmony with their surroundings, under a theocracy. They know no racism, although many consider Antiope's Lost Tribe of Amazons as little more than savages. They do not think in terms of male gender; the word "policeman" is alien to them until Diana's departure into the outside world. Homosexuality is completely natural to them — while some Amazons are chaste, others have loving consorts. Their city is composed entirely of Greco-Roman architecture from 1200&nbsp; BCE, and they wear Greek garb, togas, sandals, and period armor. The Amazons also all wear the Bracelets of Submission as constant reminders of their Enslavement and obedience to their patrons, although only Diana can deflect bullets with them. They are fervently religious, worshipping their gods as living deities. Artemis is their primary goddess, and they worship her with a sacrifice of a deer. The Amazons celebrate their creation each year in a Feast of Five, remembering the goddesses who brought them to life.

Occasionally, the [[Nereides]] bring to the shores of Themyscira young infants who would have otherwise drowned in accidents. To which the Amazons of Paradise Island would initiate a process called "send forth", where these infants are tutored spiritually in Amazonian ideals, and they are then sent back mystically to the place of their disappearance scant moments after being lost at sea. [[Julia Kapatelis]], Diana's first friend in Patriarch's World, is one such infant.

Themyscira is presently located in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] but possesses the magical ability to teleport to any location or time period its inhabitants desire.

==National timeline==
===Turmoil and genocide===
* Every headline writer who has written volume two of ''Wonder Woman'' has depicted Themyscirian slaughter:
** [[George Pérez]] – Included [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]]' rape and slaughter of the Amazons, as well as the destruction of the first [[Bana-Mighdall]] city.
** [[William Messner-Loebs]] – Depicted an Amazon tribal war over Themyscira's ownership.
** [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] – Had [[Darkseid]] invade Themyscira, kill half the population, and turned the remainder to stone.
** [[Phil Jimenez]] – Re-introduced the Amazon tribal war over Themyscira's ownership.
** [[Walt Simonson]] – Caused a Hydra to turn the Amazons into stone.
** [[Greg Rucka]] – Had [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]] kill over half the remaining Amazon population.
** [[Brian Azzarello]] – Had Hera transform all the Amazons into snakes and petrify Hippolyta.

===Enter Wonder Woman===
{{main|Wonder Woman}}
[[File:Hippww.PNG|thumb|[[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] uses the soil of Themyscira to create her daughter Diana. Art by [[Adam Hughes]].]]
In recent times, Hippolyta's daughter Diana, also known as Wonder Woman, has become an ambassador to the outside world. With Diana's help, the Amazons have opened the shores of Themyscira to dignitaries of "Patriarch’s World". The creatures beneath Doom's Doorway were defeated, and for a time the Amazons destroyed their battle armor as a testament to a new period of peace. The Amazons opened up their shores to dignitaries from Patriarch's world, female and male, but that exchange was almost destroyed by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], Goddess of Discord. The Amazons even conducted their own tour of the United States, where they were framed for the murders of several people by Antiope's descendants, the mercenary assassins of [[Bana-Mighdall]], and [[Circe (comics)|Circe]]. It was during the [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]] that the Amazons recrafted their armory, vowing to again become warriors. Circe would transplant many of these mercenary women of Bana-Migdhall, called the ''Lost Tribe'', to Themyscira, where, after warring with the Amazons already there, the two factions joined forces to stop Circe herself. The two sects of Amazons forged an uneasy truce, living at opposite ends of the island.

Professor [[Julia Kapatelis]], a close friend to Wonder Woman and the Amazons, was later presented with a [[Grant (money)|grant]] by the [[National Geographic Society]] to locate the original Turkish city of Themyscira.<ref name="ww3641" /> Unfortunately Julia had to leave the excavation midway through the project once one of her daughter's friends committed suicide.<ref>'' Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #46</ref> Whether the original city of Themyscira has been fully excavated or not has not been shown.

Later still, [[Darkseid]]’s forces ravaged Themyscira during a search to locate the Greek gods, killing nearly half of the Amazons there in the process. As they began rebuilding, the Amazons found themselves reverting to stone. This was as a result of the gods’ departure from the mortal plane, and the Amazons’ connection to their creator beings so diminished as to revert their bodies to their primordial state. With the gods returned to Olympus, the Amazons were again transformed into their flesh and blood state. Yet more Amazons were killed in a confrontation with the demonic entity known as [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]].

With Diana and Hippolyta adventuring in Patriarch's World as Wonder Woman for longer and longer periods of time, the Banas and the Themyscirans were manipulated into a bloody civil war at the hands of Magala, who had been possessed by the spirit of Antiope's murderer, [[Ariadne]]. Using the pre-existing disdain of the tribes against each other, Magala used allies among both Amazon cities to spark the vengeful conflict. The island was left in ruins, and the war was only stopped when Hippolyta abolished the royal family, renounced her throne.

Left at odds but on even political ground, the Bana Amazons and the Themyscirans joined forces against the alien forces of [[Imperiex]]. Themyscira, mystically moved into outer space, was destroyed, and hundreds of Amazons from both tribes died.<ref name="dc-ency" /> When Wonder Woman led each tribe of Amazons into an ecumenical prayer, funneling power into the new god Darkseid, the warrior women helped destroy Imperiex and its ally [[Brainiac 13]].

===New Themyscira===
[[File:GoddessBlessings.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian]] and [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana-Mighdallian]] goddesses each bless Themyscira as it is rejuvenated. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].]]
After the island had been destroyed by [[Imperiex]] during the "[[Our Worlds at War]]" storyline, Themyscira was rebuilt and relocated, this time to the [[Bermuda Triangle]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> Designed by the likes of [[Julia Kapatelis]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Steve Trevor]], Canadian architect Jean Claude Tibet, and Amazon master designer Kaleeza Fashed, the new Themyscira was built with the help of alien technology. Adding to the re-creation of the islands, Themyscira was restored by the combined might of the Greek and Egyptian goddesses the Amazons worship. Transformed into a mighty series of floating islands dedicated to the free exchange of information and ideas, the new Themyscira was governed by members of both tribes of Amazons. After some time Themyscira was nearly destroyed in a jealous fit of rage by the goddess [[Hera]]. She was angry that Zeus was magically spying on the bathing form of Artemis via scrying the pool and kicked the pool itself.<ref name="dc-ency" /> Because of her actions the islands ceased to float in mid-air under their own power and instead resumed being a cluster of traditional islands once more.

Recently, Themyscira was under attack by [[OMACs|OMAC]] forces, as described in DC Comics's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Due to this attack, as well as the many various other attacks the island has suffered through since Diana became Wonder Woman, it was decided that the [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian]] and [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana-Mighdallian]] goddesses would transport the island and its inhabitants (sans Diana) to an undisclosed location to live in peace.

===One Year Later===
Under the direction of the writer [[Will Pfeifer]], the Amazons attack [[Washington D.C.]] as retaliation for the attack on the island in a six-part mini-series titled ''[[Amazons Attack]]''. At the end of the series, the Amazons have their memories erased by [[Granny Goodness]] (posing as the goddess Athena) and are scattered throughout the world with false personas. Only Hippolyta and four of her original Royal Guard remain on Themyscira. The Queen is exiled to near-empty Themyscira (which had seemingly been sunk and restored during the battle) for her crimes of attacking [[Earth|Man's World]], though her actions had been influenced by the evil Circe.

Later, Zeus then revives the Amazons' memories and provides transport for them to return to Themyscira.

===DC Universe===
During the "[[Dark Nights: Death Metal]]" storyline, Themyscira was transformed into the new Hell where Wonder Woman became its warden who guarded the prisoners there. Gemworld became part of the transformed Themyscira.<ref>''Dark Nights: Death Metal Guidebook'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

==Flora and fauna==
===Pre-Crisis===
When the Wonder Woman comic book was first introduced, Paradise Island possessed [[horses]], and creatures called Kangas – reminiscent of the island country Australia's [[kangaroos]] – that the Amazons both rode like [[riding animal|mounts]]; the Kangas were probably a [[Kangaroo industry|breed of kangaroos]] which were introduced into the island from Australia via [[coastal migration]], which the Amazons bred them and where they originated from. Diana's Kanga was named Jumpa. There were also smaller [[rabbit|rabbit-like]] creatures wandering Paradise Island.

===Post-Crisis===
When the ''Wonder Woman'' comic book was revamped and started anew in the mid-1980s this was scrapped and the island only had common game animals such as [[antelopes]], [[deer]], [[wild boar]], [[bears]], [[lions]], and [[fish]], pets such as [[birds]], [[cats]], [[Domesticated silver fox|foxes]], [[dogs]], and [[monkeys]], and livestock animals such as [[horses]], [[donkeys]], [[camels]], [[cattle]], [[water buffalo]], [[sheep]] such as the [[European mouflon]], [[goats]] such as the [[Kri-kri]], and [[pigs]] ([[wild ancestor#List of wild ancestors and their domesticated counterparts|domesticated descendants of wild boar]]). Diana also had a pet pig named PB (actually a character from the CGI-animated film ''[[DC League of Super-Pets]]''). The only exotic/mythological creatures on the island were more sinister in nature and existed in Doom's Doorway to the underworld, which the Amazons swore to keep trapped and never to escape. In the waters surrounding Themyscira also lived [[Naiads]] and in the forests [[Dryads]] who played most of their days away, occasionally with the Amazons.

In 1999 when writer [[Eric Luke]] took over the Wonder Woman comic book, he had several lost mythical creatures from around the globe take asylum on Themyscira. These creatures consisted of: [[Chiron]] the [[centaur]], a white [[pegasus]], [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]] the [[dragon]], a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]], and a [[sphinx]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #142</ref>

Then when writer [[Phil Jimenez]] wrote the title in the early 2000s, he had several [[dinosaurs]] from the land of [[Skartaris]] also take refuge on Themyscira in addition to the reappearance of Kangas on the island. To date, no Kangas has been seen as riding animals.

Writer [[Greg Rucka]] reintroduced a second [[Pegasus]] to serve as Wonder Woman's riding companion, this one black with red eyes. It is assumed he still lives on Themyscira.

In 2003, a flashback story by [[Matt Wagner]] called ''[[Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity]]'' has the island defended by sapient giant birds. They perish in the defense of the Amazons.

The 2007 storyline "[[Amazons Attack!]]" depicted the Amazons as having creatures such as giant Stygen [[wasps]] and some domesticated [[winged horses]], large amounts of saddled [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimeras]], and three [[titans|titan-sized]] [[ogres]].

Then in 2007/2008, the "[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]" storyline introduced the then-new revelation that the island is protected by a school of [[megalodon|megalodons]].

When writer [[Gail Simone]] took over the title, she showed that Hippolyta cared for [[griffins]] in the royal stables. She also introduced the island of Thalarion, the home of [[Gargareans]] during the "[[Rise of the Olympian]]" storyline. The Gargareans possessed herds of winged horses similar to Themyscira but also possessed flocks of [[winged lion|winged lions]] as well. Their leader [[Olympian (comics)#Achilles Warkiller|Achilles]] also has a domesticated [[war elephant]] named Mysia who has two trunks, two mouths, three glowing eyes, an impenetrable hide, and the ability to walk on air. As the Gargareans incorporated themselves among the Amazons of Themyscira, it is safe to assume these creatures also reside there.
