Randy. What happened? Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do. No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night. But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little- Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car. Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there.  Get out of the way, Peterson!  How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?! We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet! It could be nationwide. No Internet... anywhere... Randy, where will you go? You don't know if there's any Internet in California.  What is it, Kyle?
