Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts. I have no idea. Yes? What?  So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own.  And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?  Yeah, sure, what about it? Why? Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s. Who is that? Did Kyle know about this? Did Kyle know about this?!  Get out of here! You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.  I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle! ...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity. You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again. Get out of here! I'm done with you!  We're done with betrayals! It's time to put an end to this! I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Then you fucking fight!  Yay. Yes, it is. Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
