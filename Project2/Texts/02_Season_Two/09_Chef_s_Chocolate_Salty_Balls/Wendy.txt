Wow! Cool! No they're not! Independent films are produced ''outside'' the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Once again, you have ''no'' idea what you're talking about, fatass! (Gasp)! Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me? Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them. Sshh! Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!  Eeewww!  Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films. Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
