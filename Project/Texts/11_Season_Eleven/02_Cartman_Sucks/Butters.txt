 Yeah.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too? Yeah Kyle? Uh what do you mean? Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle. So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while? But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.   Whoa, hey Eric.  A surprise? What is it?  Oh boy! Y-yeah!  How come uh, I can't see? Oh uh, ho yeah.  Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya? Well okay! Whoa! Hey Dad!  I'm getting a surprise!   Hey. Where'd Eric go? Like what? What's... bi-curious? Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious.  ...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright. Really? Whoa boy! Camp! Because I'm bi-curious? I'm bi-curious. He's bi-curious too? Well sure, I guess. Well yeah, sure. Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear? Yes, it's all very confusing! ...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato! Awww, that's okay, Bradley. Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home! Wuh-what's the matter? Well I like you too, Bradley. Well yeah! Sure, I like like you a lot lot.   No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy! I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast. Oh no, my Dad? Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.  Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look? You're perfectly normal, Bradley.  You know what I think? I think maybe ''you'' are the ones who are confused! I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself!  No. I like bein' bi-curious. Wait. Now I ''am'' confused.
