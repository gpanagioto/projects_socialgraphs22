Hey Sergeant, take a look at this. Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money. Take a look. Says here...  He's black. Sir? Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.  Wha- wha- what? It says right here on the final sheet he is! It said on the final sheet! Sir, it's possible that he ''is'' black, even though he doesn't look it.
