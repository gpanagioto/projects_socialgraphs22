We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea! Guinea pigs?  Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government. None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?! Dude, what is this place?  Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice! Let's see what's in there. It might be a way out, Craig! You guys, look at this.  I know, a-and look.  And then the guinea pigs killing people.  Dude, Craig, what's goin' on? Let's head over this way, guys. Wow.  All right, let's go.  Wait, whattaya mean no? Dude, we we have to go check this out. 'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is. Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe! Craig, dude, wait up.  Hey look, there's something here. No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening be''cause'' you guys got ''rid'' of all the flute bands. Jesus Christ!
