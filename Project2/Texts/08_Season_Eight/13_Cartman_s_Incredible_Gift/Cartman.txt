This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.  ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here. I'm gonna! Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to- Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations. And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight!  Eugh...  Wheh? Where am I? Coma... How long? Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap! Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours! Probably in your front pocket, dumbass! Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch. I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?! How come the outline is missing its hand? Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs! Guess again. Wow! Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks!  Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes? Do not doubt my powers, Kyle! Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought! Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at!  What? I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go! No. Nothing. Wait a minute.  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken! It ''is'' fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae. More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring. Proper channels? I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.  Ten percent, my balls, get lost! Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds! In court? Cool.  Who are you? ... 'Kay. Sweet. Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?! I don't even know you dude! Oh, Jesus. No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!  Heheh. Yes yes, I see!  AAAAAAAH! Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me!  (Hey! Come over here!)  No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested. Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability. You can't hurt me.
