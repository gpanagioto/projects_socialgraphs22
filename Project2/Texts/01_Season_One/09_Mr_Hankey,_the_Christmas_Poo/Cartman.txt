Oohhhh! Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas! I'm not fat, I'm festively plump. What the hell is Christmas Poo? Hey! What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow! Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents. Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that. Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now. You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!  Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy. How do ''you'' know? Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what ''I'm'' getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000. I don't know, but it sounds pretty ''sweet''. Let me see! Is this some kind of Jewish tradition? Thanks to Kyle's ''mother''. How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor. Gross, Kyle! YOU SICK BASTARD! Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah! Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it. 'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went. Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home! Talking poo is where I draw the line! Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you! Yeah, something feels...unfinished.
