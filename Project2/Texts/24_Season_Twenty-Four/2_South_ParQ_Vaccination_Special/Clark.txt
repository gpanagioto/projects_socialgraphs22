For the last time, Ellen, I don't want our son going to that public school! Mr. Garrison is a terrible teacher, he has no grip on the classroom and he's the worst president we've ever had! So we can get him a private tutor! It's that son of a bitch Mr.Garrison. He's gonna completely screw up our kids. Alright, Scott. Your new tutor is here.  You better pay attention and listen to everything he has to teach you!
