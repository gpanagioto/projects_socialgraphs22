'''Doctor Octopus''' ('''Dr. Otto Gunther Octavius'''), also known as '''Doc Ock''' for short, is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #3 (July 1963). He is a highly intelligent, [[Near-sightedness|myopic]], and somewhat stocky [[mad scientist]] who sports four strong and durable appendages resembling an [[octopus]]'s tentacles, which extend from the back of his body and can be used for various purposes. After his mechanical harness became permanently fused to his body during a lab accident, he turned to a life of crime, and came into conflict with the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. He has endured as one of Spider-Man's most prominent villains, and is regarded as one of his three [[Archenemy|archenemies]], alongside the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. He is the founder and leader of the [[Sinister Six]], the first [[supervillain]] team to oppose Spider-Man.

While usually portrayed as a [[supervillain]], Doctor Octopus has also been occasionally depicted as a conflicted [[antihero]] and ally of Spider-Man. Following Spider-Man's death in the 2012 storyline "[[Dying Wish]]", which saw a dying Octavius swapping bodies with the hero and letting him die in his original body, Octavius was motivated to prove he could be a better Spider-Man. As such, he adopted the '''Superior Spider-Man''' alias, introduced in ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #15.1 following a cameo in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 3 #21 (both December 2012). The Superior Spider-Man possesses all of the original Spider-Man's abilities, memories, and equipment, along with additional gadgets created by Octavius, though he often struggles to live up to his predecessor's legacy and turn his life around after being a villain for years. In 2013, Marvel launched a 45-issue ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' comic book series focusing on the character's redemption and superhero career. The original Spider-Man has since been resurrected after the death of Otto Octavius. Following ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', a copy of his consciousness became a villain, though a second volume of ''The Superior Spider-Man'' launched in 2018 saw the duplicate taking on the mantle before returning to the Doctor Octopus mantle as an [[antihero]].

Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: "Created by [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], Doc Ock, as he became known, has become one of the web-slinger's most persistent, enduring, and dangerous foes."<ref>[[Mike Conroy (writer)|Conroy, Mike]]. 500 Comicbook Villains, p.44-45, Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref> A fan favorite character and well-known figure in [[popular culture]], Doctor Octopus has been featured in various media adaptations of Spider-Man over the years, including feature films, television series, and video games. [[Alfred Molina]] portrayed [[Otto Octavius (film character)|the character]] in the films ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004) and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), while [[Kathryn Hahn]] voiced a female version of Doctor Octopus named Olivia Octavius in the animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018). [[William Salyers]] voices the character in the ''[[Spider-Man (Insomniac Games series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'' video game series and ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order]]'' (2019).

In 2009, ''[[IGN]]'' ranked Doctor Octopus 28th in the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time,<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time|url=https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-comic-book-villains|website=[[IGN]]}}</ref> and in 2014 rated him Spider-Man's greatest enemy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|website=IGN|date=April 16, 2014 }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father Torbert Octavius, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother Mary Lavinia Octavius. The young Octavius's shyness and good work in school got him labeled as a "teacher's pet" and targeted as a subject for bullying. Torbert did not appreciate having a bullied son, and roared at him to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would always defend her son from Torbert's [[tirade]]s, saying he was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. Due to his mother's insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in common manual labor, Octavius was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Octavius's devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a [[university]] [[scholarship]]. During Octavius's freshman year of college, he was undecided in his studies until they were briefly interrupted by his father's funeral; a construction accident having ended Torbert's life. When Mary remarked that "an early death is a manual laborer's" and she expected better from her son, this seemed to spur an obsession in Octavius about the hard sciences, and he declared his major to be physical science. His obsession, however, did not manifest immediately, and he was regarded by his school friends as a devoted student who was genuinely interested in the studies. He graduated near the top of his class, and was considered a catch to many scientific firms. Octavius was soon hired by an engineering firm.

Octavius became a brilliant and respected [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], atomic research consultant, [[inventor]] and [[lecturer]]. He designed a set of highly advanced [[Remote manipulator|mechanical arms]] controlled via a [[brainâ€“computer interface]] to assist him with his research into [[atomic physics]]. The tentacle-like arms were resistant to radiation and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/> Later in his criminal career, he claimed the inspiration for the device came from the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the famous pencil sketch by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], one of his idols.<ref>''Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Though his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, he was social enough to give a demonstration of his harness to a small group. He showed how the metal tentacles allowed him to work safely with chemicals that would normally be too dangerous for a human being to touch or be in close vicinity to. One such person impressed by this was a scientist named Mary Alice Anders, and the two soon dated. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice. However, when Otto joyously announced his future marriage to his mother, her feelings were not reciprocated. Believing that no woman was good enough for her son, she made him feel guilty that she was going to be pushed aside for his bride-to-be. Shocked that he hurt his mother, and to please her, Otto broke off the engagement with Mary Alice. Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her, causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument. With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius' disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> His co-workers often called him "Doctor Octopus" behind his back, a pun on his actual name inspired by the four-armed apparatus; he was aware of this insult, but he barely cared.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/>

===Criminal career begins===
During an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius's body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from great distances. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was, in fact, his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs<ref name="untoldtales">{{Cite book|last = DeCandido|first = Keith R.A.|author-link = Keith R.A. DeCandido|editor = Stan Lee and Kurt Busiek|title = Untold Tales of Spider-Man|year=1997|publisher = Berkley Trade; Boulevard edition|chapter = Arms and the Man|isbn = 978-1-57297-294-0|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/untoldtalesofspi00stan}}</ref>), and the scientist turned to a life of crime, first taking the hospital hostage and calling himself "Doctor Octopus" from the derogatory name that his co-workers had given him.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/> Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is [[Near-sightedness|near-sighted]], with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man. The accident also made his eyes very [[Photophobia|sensitive to light]], requiring him to wear glasses with shaded lenses.<ref>''Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In their first encounter, Doctor Octopus defeated Spider-Man, tossing him out of a window. Following this defeat, Spider-Man considered giving up his heroic career but was inspired to continue by the [[Human Torch]], and ultimately defeated Doctor Octopus.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/>

Over the years, Doctor Octopus has become one of the most identifiable members of [[List of Spider-Man enemies|Spider-Man's rogues gallery]]. Doctor Octopus formed the original [[Sinister Six]] to fight Spider-Man after taking [[Betty Brant]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]] hostage.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He has led subsequent Sinister Six groups and usually takes offense when someone else leads the team. Disguised as the '''Master Planner''', he organized theft of atomic equipment. After he stole a formula that Spider-Man needed to cure his Aunt May, Spider-Man tracked Doctor Octopus' gang to their base. In the ensuing fight, Spider-Man became trapped underneath a collapsed building. Seemingly doomed, Spider-Man was ultimately able to draw upon the sheer force of his will to summon the strength to escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31-32. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed he used a scuba tank to escape.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Doctor Octopus later attempts to steal the Defense Department's Nullifier device, and sets a trap for Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref> He became [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s tenant,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #54. Marvel Comics.</ref> then got close enough to use the Nullifier on Spider-Man; although he had hoped that it would merely nullify Spider-Man's web-shooters, the radiation in Spider-Man's blood resulted in the Nullifier's interaction with Spider-Man's unique biology rendering him amnesiac,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #55. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus subsequently tricking Spider-Man into helping him before Spider-Man's own better nature resulted in him turning against his 'partner' despite his memory loss long enough for [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] to use the Nullifier to shut down his tentacles.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus later exhibited the ability to activate his mechanical arms remotely, and used them to free himself from prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #88. Marvel Comics.</ref> His resulting battle with Spider-Man resulted in Captain [[George Stacy]]'s death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #89-90. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus later waged a gang war with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #112-115. Marvel Comics.</ref> He attempted to wed May Parker in order to acquire an island with an atomic plant which she had recently (and unknowingly) inherited.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130-131. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus escaped death when the island was destroyed in a thermonuclear explosion and began a life as a homeless person.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #152, 154 and 156. Marvel Comics.</ref> He next battled the "ghost" of Hammerhead, unwittingly returned him to his corporeal form using a particle accelerator and defeated him after forming a temporary alliance with Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #157-159. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus later attempted to hijack an atomic submarine.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also attempted to poison New York City with printers' ink, and battled the [[Punisher]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> He next battled the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and his gang.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Volume 1 (1976-98)|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #73 and 75-76. Marvel Comics.</ref> He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor in a laboratory before meltdown.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #124. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later displayed symptoms which [[Mister Fantastic]] diagnosed as multiple personality disorder.<ref name="Fantastic Four #267">''Fantastic Four'' #267. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Wars]]" storyline, Doctor Octopus was taken to the [[Beyonder]]'s [[Battleworld]], where he fought a horde of heroes and plotted against [[Doctor Doom]] for the leadership of the group of villains. He was able to defeat the [[X-Men]], until [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] came to the mutants' aid.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Arachnophobia===
His crowning achievement of evil was the near-fatal beating of the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] (Spider-Man's then-partner) which led to Spider-Man beating Doctor Octopus to within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Otto Octavius afraid of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years, and he needed to be treated for his acute [[arachnophobia]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow Octavius to break free of his fears and recruit him to save [[New York City]] from an exploding nuclear reactor; Octavius had been planning to detonate the reactor to kill Spider-Man indirectly, but after his out-of-control arms beat Spider-Man seemingly senseless, Spider-Man convinced him to shut down the reactor to ensure that there were witnesses to his 'great triumph'. Octavius decided to let Spider-Man live on the grounds that he would now have to cope with the same humiliation he had endured.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #297. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Death" and resurrection===
During the "[[Clone Saga]]", Doctor Octopus saved Spider-Man from certain death from a poison injected by the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], although this was only because ''he'' desired to be the one to kill Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #220. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the healing process, he discovered Spider-Man's identity and then allowed himself to be taken in by police, expecting to be saved by his accomplice/lover Stunner. However, Stunner was knocked out and Doctor Octopus was murdered by the insane Spider-Man clone [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #221. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Lady Octopus|Carolyn Trainer]] took over as "Doctor Octopus" until her teacher was resurrected by a branch of the mystical [[ninja]] cult known as the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #427. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon his resurrection, it was revealed that he now had no knowledge of Spider-Man's identity, as the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer, and the memory of Spider-Man's identity had not been recorded at the time of his death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #428. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Subsequent schemes===
In later years, Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed "[[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Spider-Woman]]". He has also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of arrogant young businessman and con artist [[Luke Carlyle]], who pretended to employ Octavius at his company.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #43. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tiring of his life of crime and wishing to return to an engineering career, Octavius accepted the offer. This proved to be a ruse, and Carlyle subdued Doctor Octopus and stole his technology, using it to create his own version of Octavius' harness and tentacles.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #44. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a prolonged battle with Octavius and Spider-Man, Carlyle was defeated when Doctor Octopus ripped open his suit, allowing Spider-Man to fill Carlyle's suit with webbing, although Doctor Octopus informed his enemy that he only did this to hurt Carlyle rather than to help Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Then, Doctor Octopus took the ambassador of the newly formed Free Palestinian State hostage, demanding that in exchange for the ambassador's freedom, Spider-Man would meet him in Times Square and unmask himself in front of the world. When Spider-Man went to Times Square, he pulled off his mask to reveal another mask, angering Octavius enough to distract him from the release of the ambassador by agents of the Israeli Secret Service.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus was taken to Ryker's Island and was drugged and brainwashed to kill the [[Green Goblin]]. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memory of the event and missing two months of his life.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While hiding in a plant that was owned by the villain Fusion, Octavius was apparently forced to work for Fusion in helping him recover the 'John Hancock' satellite, once used to find nuclear weapons but now capable of finding potentially radioactive superhumans such as the Hulk or Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Fusion had apparently forced Octavius into submission, Octavius eventually revealed that he had merely been faking his submission so that Fusion could do all the hard work of finding the satellite for Octavius to sell off,<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #40. Marvel Comics.</ref> subsequently beating Fusion half to death and attempting to sell the satellite himself before he was caught and defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #41. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Civil War''===
Octavius unsuccessfully tried to form and lead another version of the [[Sinister Six]], because [[Captain America]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Secret Avengers]] managed to defeat the villainous group, although Doctor Octopus himself eluded authorities. In ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #28, Doctor Octopus is seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker in their second encounter (at the time, Octavius assumed he was an impostor).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #11-12. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Doctor Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter's students distract Octavius.{{issue|date=December 2010}} He is then sent to [[Baron Zemo]]'s supervillain detention facility (as seen in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #104 and ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' (vol. 4) #14). [[Spider-Man: One More Day|Later]], Spider-Man contacts Octavius to see if he can help with Aunt May's condition.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dying===
When Doctor Octopus learns that he is dying due to the years of punishment his body took in his villainous career, facing superhuman foes when he is fundamentally human once getting past the tentacles, he becomes increasingly despondent and brazen in his final plans. Intending to leave a lasting legacy, he attempts to exert control over New York City by using his newly minted Octobots, but while he consciously intends to help, his subconscious drives him to turn the city's resources against Spider-Man, and he also targets May Parker aggressively (deeming her guilty of being due to marry J. Jonah Jameson's father J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.), subtly disrupting the planned marriage. Spider-Man is eventually able to take control of Octavius's planned network, forcing Octavius to flee while vowing revenge.<ref name="ASM600">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In his desperate attempts to prolong his life, Octavius reforms the Sinister Six, wishing to acquire [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s unborn son, hoping to synthesize a pure strain of the Goblin Serum,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref> only to be thwarted again by the efforts of Spider-Man and the guilty conscience of the Lizard,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646. Marvel Comics.</ref> reigniting his bitterness towards his foe, but gaining a grudging acknowledgment of his abilities.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #648">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref> Octavius and Spider-Man keep crossing their ways during the following months, with the Avengers fighting a new iteration of the Sinister Six,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #648"/> Doctor Octopus sending a remote Octobot in John Jameson's shuttle,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #653. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Octavius contacting [[Iron Man]] to force him to find a cure for his degenerative condition.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #501. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when Iron Man genuinely offers to have the brightest minds in the Marvel Universe find a viable cure,<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #502.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

His attempts to prolong his life, however, do not hinder a more vast and sinister plan, in which he has the Sinister Six fighting the [[Avengers Academy]] for a piece of [[Hank Pym]]'s technology,<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> the [[Future Foundation]] for a piece of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richard]]'s technology,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #660.

Doctor Octopus at first claims to have a benevolent intent, wishing to halt the [[greenhouse effect]] in exchange for gratitude and recognition,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682. Marvel Comics.</ref> but he is soon exposed by Spider-Man (having enhanced himself with new Horizon Labs-built tech),<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #683">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683.

==="Death" and rebirth===
Even captivity and incarceration were unable to stop Octavius. Since Spider-Man was forced to access the Octobots' hive mind several times in previous months,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #683"/><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man #672''. Marvel Comics.</ref> he unwittingly gave Octavius a full, unrestricted access to his mind and as such he becomes able to program a lone Octobot to swap their mind pattern. Octavius is now in Peter Parker's body and able to access his foe's memories, but with none of his restraints content of living his civilian life and planning for his future, while his foe is now trapped in Octavius' failing body.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #698">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #698. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Peter is able to recruit the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], [[Hydro-Man]] and the [[Trapster]] with the task of keeping him alive and capturing "Spider-Man" in an attempt to reverse the mind swap. However, the Trapster's portable life support can give Peter only 700 minutes to live.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699. Marvel Comics.</ref> As such, Peter openly antagonizes "Spider-Man". While Peter's attempt to reclaim his body fails, he is able to imbue his nemesis with his very memories and values before apparently dying in Octavius' crippled body. Distraught, Octavius (in a sudden surge of empathy for his sworn nemesis) vows to steer himself away from villainy and accepts Peter's dying wish of having a Spider-Man protect New York. Octavius claims that, since he now holds the physical might and the good values embodied by Spider-Man but also the boundless ambition and the scientific mindframe of Doctor Octopus, he will surpass the "Amazing Spider-Man", becoming a "[[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]]".<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700.

===''The Superior Spider-Man''===
Within Spider-Man's body, Octavius starts his new career as a hero by redesigning his gear and putting his past as a villain behind himself.<ref name="Avenging Spider-Man 15.1">''Avenging Spider-Man'' #15.1.

Marvel Comics.</ref> all of them trying to take over the place left by the seemingly-dead Doctor Octopus and his Sinister Six. While they are still no match for the new, more ruthless Spider-Man, his violence and new mannerisms start to tip off several of his close friends and allies, such as the whole staff of Horizon Labs, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]],<ref name="Daredevil 22"/> [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (explicitly forbidden to have Spider-Man's mind telepathically scanned under the threat of legal action in court),<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Mary Jane Watson]],<ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #1"/> and [[Carlie Cooper]].<ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #2">''The Superior Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Despite his accomplishments, Octavius is revealed to be still haunted by Peter Parker's lingering spirit, unable to reassert control over Spider-Man's shared body, but actively hampering his efforts to stray from Peter's values, and trying to reclaim his body.<ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #2"/> Despite Peter's lingering influence, Octavius's refusal of Peter's values and perceived screw-ups prompts him to "rectify" some mistakes: "Peter" enrolls back to college, pursuing actively the PhD Peter denied himself in the past,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> and breaks the self-imposed "no-kill rule" by taking a proactive stance against evildoers and criminals, shooting the villain [[Massacre (Marvel Comics)|Massacre]] even after Massacre appeared to show signs of recovering from the brain damage that motivated his crimes,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> and violently assaulting the Jester and Screwball for a relatively minor insult.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> These actions prompted the Avengers to confront "Spider-Man" about his recent activities, recognizing that their friend would never act in such a manner.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> When their subsequent analysis confirms that he is still biologically Peter Parker, Octavius explains that he is merely dealing with stress over recent events.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Attempting a mind-wipe of all of Peter's memories to destroy the living consciousness completely, Octavius manages to delete the ''Daily Bugle'' memory. Realizing Peter would not surrender, Octavius directly engages his foe in Spider-Man's mind. After beating Peter to a pulp by breaking his spirit with the knowledge Peter was willing let a girl named Amy come close to death when Octavius was performing surgery on her with a scanner that would have detected him, Octavius declares his final victory while calling Peter unworthy to be called Spider-Man and believes that he deleted all of Spider-Man's memories. Returning to the real world, Octavius rejoices from his belief that he is free and has achieved victory over Spider-Man.<ref name="SSM9">''The Superior Spider-Man'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> But this erasure has also deprived him of Spider-Man's memories, leaving it more difficult for him to pose as Spider-Man, with some of Peter's friends (such as Carlie, Mary Jane, and J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.) questioning Spider-Man's more brutal approach.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Octavius has developed more detailed resources than Peter possessed as Spider-Man, such as creating a small army of Spider-bots and Spiderling allies to assist him, as well as helping [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] trap the body-hopping mutant [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]] in a specially-designed containment unit,<ref>''A + X'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> he continues to resort to more questionable methods, such as killing [[Alistair Smythe]],<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> and blackmailing Jameson into giving him free rein in New York by threatening to expose the fact that Jameson asked him to do this. During a series of confrontations with his former allies in the Sinister Six, he also attempted to brainwash them into becoming his new 'team', resulting in him being forced to join forces with new hero [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]] when the Six snapped out of his control and tried to kill him.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Octavius's focus on the larger scale also resulted in him missing the Green Goblin's efforts to establish a new criminal empire, with the Green Goblin rescuing criminals who have escaped Spider-Man and recruiting them into his new gang, as Octavius simply focused on the leaders whereas Peter would have tried to capture the whole gang. His fixation in proving himself Spider-Man's superior reached a particular climax when [[Spider-Man 2099]] came to the past to deal with a temporal anomaly,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> with Octavius becoming so fixated with solving the problem and keeping his identity secret that he actually attacked the future Spider-Man rather than ask for his help,<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> his actions resulting in the destruction of Horizon Labs because he could not solve the [[vibranium]]-related equations that Peter was able to resolve. Unknown to Octavius, Peter's memories managed to survive the deletion. When Octavius attempts to access Spider-Man's memories (because Octavius can only view memories that were looked at before the delete), Peter is shown lifting the 'rocks' off himself from the mental battle.<ref name="ReferenceA">''The Superior Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Carlie had found evidence that Doctor Octopus' mind is in Spider-Man's body, she mourns Peter in Doctor Octopus' grave. The grave then collapses and Carlie falls in where she discovers that Doctor Octopus' body is not there. After Carlie has been captured by Menace, the Goblin King receives Carlie's journal from Menace, where the Goblin King discovers evidence in it that states that Doctor Octopus' mind is in Spider-Man's body.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following him being possessed by the Venom symbiote, Octavius receives unexpected help from Peter Parker's consciousness, though Octavius is still unaware that Peter survived their mental duel. Peter decides to maintain a low profile until Octavius does something that will cause him to spring into action.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> Peter finds that Octavius's delete has left him with very few memories of his own, but after realizing those he still has are the ones that define him, vows not to give up, and that he will regain control of his body.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Superior Spider-Man finds himself facing the full force of the Goblin Underground since the possession of the Venom symbiote 31 days ago. When the Superior Spider-Man finally confronts the Goblin King, he mentions that he knows about Doctor Octopus' mind-swap with Spider-Man. The Goblin King then makes his next move by having missiles targeted at Spider-Island II.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Octavius survived the bombardment and escaped with the Living Brain. He then tries to find the Goblin King; however, before he can do so, Menace takes supporting character [[Anna Maria Marconi]] hostage.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> Meanwhile, the Goblin destroys all the buildings that mean something to Octavius, to punish him for robbing the Goblin of his dream: Killing Spider-Man. Octavius is lured to Empire State University, where he finds Don Lamaze. During the ensuing fight, Lamaze takes a blade meant for Octavius and dies in the Superior Spider-Man's arms. Heading to Alchemax, he is confronted by Spider-Man 2099, who takes control of the Spider-Slayers and demands answers. However, before he gets them, the Goblin King reactivates the Slayers to kill the Spiders, stating Norman Osborn now rules New York.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although he manages to escape, Octavius is forced to realize that he has failed in his goal to be a 'Superior' Spider-Man when the restored Peter Parker takes over to save a child from a runaway train where Octavius hesitated, reflecting that he is aware of his fundamental inferiority, as he overcompensates while Peter holds himself back, but acts when he has to. Octavius then willingly deletes his own consciousness so that Peter can regain control of his body. As Octavius's last memories fade, it is shown he had really fallen in love with Anna Maria, much to Peter's surprise. Octavius tells Peter he is willing to give up his love to keep her safe - something only Peter can do as the ''true'' Superior Spider-Man - and urges the hero to save New York in his place.<ref name="The Superior Spider-Man #30">''The Superior Spider-Man'' #30.

===''Spider-Verse''===
In the run-up to ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', Octavius was sent to the year 2099 by accident while dealing with the temporal anomalies caused by Horizon's time portal.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Trapped in the future, he attempted to return home by creating a dimensional portal, but found himself travelling to various alternate universes â€“ including one where Spider-Man joined the [[Fantastic Four]] and a variation of the [[House of M]] â€“ where all the Spider-Men were dead. Realizing that something was hunting Spider-Men across other dimensions, Octavius began to gather some of the more ruthless Spider-Men into a team that could oppose whatever was killing them, including Spider-Man Noir, a multi-armed Spider-Man, Pavitr Prabhakar, and a Peter Parker working in black ops with Wolverine.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the crisis unfolds, Octavius takes command of a group of alternate Spider-Men, considering himself particularly qualified to lead them due to his unique nature and willingness to kill,{{issue|date=December 2014}} but when his team is confronted by another group led by the Peter Parker of Earth-616 â€“ who Octavius presumes is a past Peter as he cannot contemplate the possibility that he will fail- he is forced to concede to Peter's leadership when Peter defeats him in a fight, Peter stating that killing Morlun and the Inheritors is not the answer, as they will just come back, and they need a new plan.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although he realizes that Peter comes from his future when Peter recognizes Anna Maria's name, Otto is forced to acknowledge his own failures when he learns that another Earth where [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]] was the Spider-Totem was reduced to a nuclear wasteland due to the actions of his own local counterpart.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man' 2015">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

To stop the Inheritors from traveling around the multiverse, hunting all animal totems as fast as possible, Octavius identified the [[Karn (comics)|Master Weaver]] as the source of their abilities to traverse the multiverse, and killed him. However, Morlun feared the consequences of this action,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> resulting in Karn, the surviving defected Inheritor, taking the Weaver's place (although it was noted that the Weaver was actually Karn's future self, creating a complex temporal paradox). Having learned that he was 'destined' to be replaced by Peter Parker, Octavius attempted to attack the multiversal web to 'save' himself from his destiny, claiming that he was giving the spiders the 'gift' of free will, but the Earth-616 spiders were able to defeat him as their surviving allies returned to their home dimensions. Before he departed, Octavius issued a time-delayed message to the Anna Maria program, intended to activate 100 days after he returned to his home time, but upon his return to his time, his memory of his time with the Spider-Army is erased, allowing history to unfold as it should.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #15.

===''All-New, All-Different Marvel''===
As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Otto Octavius is still dead but a copy of his consciousness is shown to be inside the Living Brain where he is still in love with Anna Maria Marconi.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the events of ''Spider-Verse'', Otto Octavius had backed up his consciousness in one of his gauntlets (the Superior Spider-Man's web-shooters) that slept for 100 days using the technology he acquired from 2099.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #18" /><ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32-33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The gauntlet housed a copy of Octavius's consciousness up to the point of ''Spider-Verse'' (without the memories of learning about power and responsibility for his act of self-sacrifice in ''Goblin Nation'', as this copy would remain asleep during this time). After transforming the gauntlet into a version of an Octobot, he backed himself up in the Living Brain while waiting for the next opportunity to take over Parker's body again, planning to act at a time when Parker's spider-sense would be taxed so that he would miss the relevant signals.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #18">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #18.

At the time when the Living Brain was at Parker Industries' London branch, Doctor Octopus' consciousness expresses anger over being forced to act like their lackey.

===="Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy"====
During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, Peter decides to have Parker Industries get familiar with New U Enterprises' "New U" system, which is a program where replacement organs are cloned for those suffering from serious injuries. Upon hearing about it from within the Living Brain, Doctor Octopus' consciousness expresses an interest in the procedure.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Peter Parker scanned the Living Brain to find out why it was acting unusually, Doctor Octopus' consciousness asked why it was erased. Realizing the truth, Peter Parker shut down the Living Brain, only for Doctor Octopus' consciousness to reactivate it and cause it to self-destruct while escaping in the Octobot. Arriving at New U Enterprises, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot plans to get his biological body back, convinced that the consciousness in Parker's body was "infected" by its time in Spider-Man to believe that Peter was superior rather than himself.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #18"/> Upon heading to Potter's Field, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot finds that Doctor Octopus' body was grave-robbed, alongside those of Alistair Alphonso Smythe and other villains. It traces the grave robbery to New U Technologies. Finding Doctor Octopus' body, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot allowed it to be cloned and perfected. After eliminating the copy of Peter Parker's consciousness, Doctor Octopus gains control of the clone body and emerges from the vat where he resembles his earlier appearance. The [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] was present where he presents him with his tentacle pack. Now an ally of the Jackal, Doctor Octopus receives the special New U Pills to prevent his body from suffering clone degeneration.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #20.

When he discovers what appears to be Gwen Stacy, he is distracted long enough to be caught off-guard by the reborn Octavius, once again in his own body with new tentacles.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Spider-Man trapped in his tentacles, Doctor Octopus tells him that he is not a clone or a hologram, but the real Otto Octavius.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20"/>

Marvel Comics.</ref>

While studying the clones of [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and Electro in order to perfect the Proto-Clone, Anna Maria was brought to Otto and she becomes uncomfortable when Doctor Octopus starts appealing towards his love interest. When the Jackal enters the laboratory, Anna Maria reveals she knows how to stop the decaying process on the clones and the Jackal offers her the "Proto-Clone" body in exchange for the formula. Octavius takes offense to the Jackal's comments on Maria's dwarfism and attacks his boss. Then he pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus fights the Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency, Spider-Man correctly anticipating that Octavius would act to protect Anna regardless of their own history. The frequency has a huge effect on Doctor Octopus and the Jackal. Upon checking New U Technologies' Haven following the broadcast, Spider-Man and Anna Maria find that Ben Reilly, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy have been seemingly reduced to dust.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later revealed that Doctor Octopus rendered Ben Reilly unconscious and escaped by transmitting his mind into the Proto-Clone (a perfect clone of Peter Parker) before Ben Reilly could.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #24.

In the "[[Sinister War]]" storyline, Doctor Octopus coerces Dr. Curt Connors into using the Isotope Particle Accelerator on himself which separates Lizard from Dr. Connors. While in the Osborn Graveyard, Doctor Octopus demands that Kindred gives him the answers he seeks. Kindred states to Doctor Octopus that he'll get the answers soon as he adds Mysterio to the latest incarnation to the Sinister Six.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #70. Marvel Comics.</ref> In truth, Doctor Octopus secretly prepares a sonic transducer to destroy Kindred's centipedes, at cost of knocking the rest of Spider-Man's past foes, while saving them as well from hunting Spider-Man before the centipedes devoured their brains. To do so, Otto took a centipede from an undead Sin-Eater's brain and used it on his transducer to both knock out and save Spider-Man's past foes, barring Spider-Man and himself, while Boomerang was killed by Morlun when trying to save Spider-Man. Before splitting up, Otto urges Peter to make himself scarce and continue to fight Kindred safely before the surviving factions could recover, as most of them would still want to kill him.<ref>''Sinister War'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Beyond===
During the "Beyond" arc, Aunt May enlists Doctor Octopus to help bring Peter Parker out of a coma that he was placed into during a fight with the [[U-Foes]]. They did so by obtaining the samples of X-Ray and Vapor. When Aunt May returned to Peter's hospital room, she found that the hospital received some technology from Doctor Octopus which came in handy in bringing Peter Parker out of a coma. Doctor Octopus later attacks the satellite location of Beyond Corporation's [[shell corporation]] Infinite Solutions and finds that they were taking assets from the defunct Parker Industries, their use of Ben Reilly's incarnation of Spider-Man, and the copying of Doctor Octopus' Spider-Man technology. This causes Doctor Octopus to declare vengeance on the Beyond Corporation.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #80.BEY. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Devil's Reign===
During the "[[Devil's Reign]]" storyline, Doctor Octopus becomes part of Mayor Wilson Fisk's Thunderbolts unit. He accompanied the NYPD and [[Homeland security|Homeland Security]] to the Baxter Building to do a full investigation on the weapons of mass destruction that might be located there. Before Reed and Susan can retaliate, Doctor Octopus appears and places power dampener collars on them. He and Mayor Fisk persuaded the government that Reed worked for the work to look the other way and states that they now must come with them as a Thunderbolts unit shows up. Susan manages to get a Code X7 out to Human Torch, Ben Grimm, Franklin Richards, and Valeria Richards causing them to evacuate and get to [[Alicia Masters]] and the kids with her. Doctor Octopus later contacts Mayor Fisk about the inventions that he found in Reed Richards' lab.<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the sub-basement of City Hall, Mayor Fisk meets with Doctor Octopus as they reference the time when [[Doctor Doom]] used Purple Man to control the world as it shows Purple Man's body in a diamond-shaped container. Doctor Octopus' invention would help coerce the people of New York. Mayor Fisk states that he'll handle the rest. With the special Neuro Blockers to keep him safe from the Purple Man's influence, Doctor Octopus states that his part of the job is done. Doctor Octopus later makes use of Reed Richards' inter-dimensional gate where he brings over version of himself like [[Hulk]] from Earth-8816 who has two sets of arms growing from his back, a version of [[Ghost Rider]] from Earth-1666 with chain-tentacles coming out of his back, and a version of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] from Earth-9712 with immensely sharp blades on the tentacles coming out of his back. Doctor Octopus then considers his plans "Superior".<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus is contacted by Mayor Fisk about the Purple Children as Doctor Octopus states that he is occupied at Reed Richards' laboratory, but can work on modifying Purple Man's confinement when they have been found. After the call, Doctor Octopus tells Hulk of Earth-8816, Ghost Rider of Earth-1666, and Wolverine of Earth-9712 that they will see some action soon. Later that night, the superheroes arrive at City Hall where they are attacked by Doctor Octopus' Superior Four as Mayor Fisk watches from the window. Captain America discovers that Iron Man is actually Chameleon in disguise who Doctor Octopus was going to use to take part in the mayoral election on his behalf.<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Two weeks later, Doctor Octopus has released thousands of his Octobots in order to enforce Mayor Wilson Fisk's zero-tolerance policy, effectively wiping out all crime in the city. He and Wolverine of Earth-9712 visit Mayor Fisk as Doctor Octopus informs him that Butch Pharris has been arrested for his criminal activities.<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus and his Superior Four make plans to obtain the intellect of Doctor Octopus' counterparts throughout the Multiverse using a synthetic blood-parasite from Earth-5069 like they did on Spider-Ock of Earth-2902. When it comes to Earth-7214, the Superior Four attack its Atlantis and are confronted by Supreme Octopus.<ref>''Devil's Reign: Superior Four'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus is then teleported to the Savage Land on Earth-8969 where he is ensnared by Supreme Octopus who considers himself superior to Doctor Octopus where he mentioned that he liquefied Shuma-Gorath, made Dormammu grovel, and burned Knull to ashes. The rest of the Superior Four are brought to Earth-8969 where neither of them want to follow Supreme Octopus. Despite what the Superior do, they are unable to beat Supreme Octopus. Hulk of Earth-8816, Ghost Rider of Earth-1666, and Wolverine of Earth-9712 turn against Doctor Octopus and help Supreme Octopus to rip off Doctor Octopus' tentacles. Doctor Octopus is then locked up with a skeleton and carnivorous plants in Supreme Octopus' mobile base called the Supreme Sanctorum.<ref>''Devil's Reign: Superior Four'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Otto Octavius is a genius in the field of [[atomic physics]], and he holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy#United States|Ph. D.]] in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader. His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] to offer his expertise when the [[Invisible Woman]] suffered from complications during her [[Valeria Richards|second pregnancy]] as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers.<ref name="Fantastic Four #267"/>

Due to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has acquired the mental ability of psychokinetic control over the four electrically powered, telescoping, [[Prehensility|prehensile]], [[titanium]]-steel artificial tentacle "arms" (a degree of psychokinetic control over them that he can also exercise over vast distances even when they are not connected to him) that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. Each of these four arms is capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages are enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like [[Spider-Man]], or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine. Due to his weight and age, his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security, only to find he is a formidable combatant. He has managed to force opponents as formidable as Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Captain America]] to take up a defensive position in a fight.<ref>[http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg Spectacular Spider-Man #221] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221140910/http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg|date=February 21, 2012}}</ref>

Doctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

Doctor Octopus has begun wearing a full-body armor suit due to an illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years, made even worse by the fact that his ability to ''take'' damage is still at a human norm, even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment; he relies completely on his arms to prevent opponents with superhuman strength getting in close enough to damage his relatively unfit physical form even before his illness. To compensate, he has covered his entire body with his new suit, his normal arms are bound to his chest, and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness. He has also developed psychokinetic-telepathic control over an army of "Octobots" (small [[octopus]]-like drones).<ref name="ASM600"/>

===Harnesses===
Doctor Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original [[titanium]] harness, a more powerful [[adamantium]] harness, and a [[carbonadium]] harness with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The titanium and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in ''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4.

His current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense, but lightweight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death.<ref>''Daredevil'' #165. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the [[Hulk]] into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The adamantium in his tentacles made besting [[Iron Man]] in combat possible, tearing the hero's armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to allow his persistent problem with alcohol abuse to flare up.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack, allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily. Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets.

===Powers as the Superior Spider-Man===
With his mind having taken over Spider-Man's body,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #698"/> Octavius gains possession of all of Spider-Man's memories, powers, abilities, and equipment,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700"/> although he loses access to Spider-Man's memories after apparently removing his foe from their shared mind.<ref name="SSM9"/> As a way to reaffirm his perceived superior mind, he tinkered with the original Spider-Man costume, adding some carbonadium plating over his neck and skull,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700"/> talons on his hands and feet, split-toed footwear fashioned as [[Tabi|jika-tabi]] shoes, a slightly different, more imposing spider-motif on his back and enhanced lenses in his costume, with HUD and tracking abilities.<ref name="Avenging Spider-Man 15.1"/>

He also retains access to some of his former hideouts from when he was Doctor Octopus, coupling Horizon Tech-derived inventions with his own peculiar brand of technology.<ref name="Avenging Spider-Man 15.1"/>

===Octobots===
The '''[[Octobot (robot)|Octobot]]s''' are octopus-themed robots that are created by Doctor Octopus. There are two different kinds of Octobots:

* The first model of the Octobot seen are little metal balls with eight legs, which are mentally controlled by Doctor Octopus via a remote control. These Octobots can also be used to attack, to perform different tasks, and attach themselves to anyone so that Doctor Octopus can mentally control them.
* The second model of the Octobot seen is a giant metallic robot, which Doctor Octopus uses to attack huge constructions.

The Octobots have at least two known variations:

* The '''[[Spider-Slayer]]s''' â€“ These Spider-Slayers that appeared in ''[[Spider-Island]]'' are actually first generation Octobots that Spider-Man had laden with a special serum, which was used to cure the Spider-Virus that slowly turned everyone into Man-Spiders.
* The '''Spider-Bots''' â€“ The Spider-Bots are small red and blue spiders. While his mind was inside Spider-Man's body, he controlled them remotely and was able to enact constant surveillance over all of New York city, perform different tasks and control technology.

===Powers as the Superior Octopus===
In his [[Superior Octopus]] body, Octavius retains access to Peter Parker's powers, while also having a new set of his original tentacles designed to work with this body.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #25"/>

He is later revealed to in fact be working with the Nazis and their American proxies, the "[[Friends of New Germany]]", with the plot of making all minorities into mindless slaves. However, his experiments are uncovered by Spider-Man, and although he is allowed to leave the country due to his past service to America, he is subsequently rejected by the Nazis, as they believe his crippled body reflects a crippled mind that could produce nothing of value for them.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Mask'' #1-4.

===''Spider-Man: Life Story''===
''Spider-Man: Life Story'' features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962 as in the original timeline. In the 1970s, Octavius gave up being Doctor Octopus after suffering a heart attack, making him afraid of his own mortality. He eventually married May Parker and was offered a job at Future Foundations by Reed Richards. However, May later divorced him due to his anger management issues, leading him to a life of crime once more. In 1995, Norman Osborn tells him Spider-Man's secret identity and reveals he has a clone named Ben Reilly in Chicago. An elderly Octavius kidnaps Peter and Ben and takes them to Oscorp (after threatening Harry for the equipment) so he could learn how to clone himself a new body. While studying them, he discovers that Peter was supposedly the clone while Ben was the original, leading Ben to lash out at him. He attempts to kill both Peter and Ben, but ends up accidentally killing Harry and runs away in shock. Peter later discovers that Norman rigged the machines Octavius was using to make it appear that he was the clone. In 2019, the dying Octavius switches bodies with the newer, younger Spider-Man, Miles Morales, in order to preserve his life and become a "superior" hero. He aids the older Peter Parker in activating the "Doomsday Pulse" in space to shut down Doctor Doom's technology across the planet. After they encounter a Venom-possessed Kraven the Hunter, Peter deduces that Octavius is in Miles' body from his interactions with Kraven and his technical knowledge. Octavius attempts to destroy Peter's mind, but Peter uses a memory of Aunt May to convince him to accept his life's limitations. Peter sends Octavius back to Earth with the space station's only escape pod and sacrifices himself to activate the Doomsday Pulse. After his return, Octavius willingly puts himself and Miles back in their original bodies.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #2-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

DC/Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Doctor Octopus is younger, more muscular, and wears sunglasses to disguise scars from the accident that fused him to his metal arms. His arms are made of nanobots, and thus can transform into different tools. He initially claims to have a psychic link with his metal arms, demonstrated by controlling them remotely.<ref>''Ultimate Six'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later revealed to have Ferrokinesis.<ref name="UltimateSpiderMan">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He seeks revenge against Hammer, but is defeated by [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]], although Hammer died of a heart attack caused by Octavius' attack.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Osborn, form the [[Sinister Six|Ultimate Six]], consisting of [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel]], [[Kraven the Hunter#Ultimate Marvel|Kraven the Hunter]], and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Sandman]].

Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them.<ref>''Ultimate Six'' #1-7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage. He manages to capture Parker and brings him aboard an airplane, torturing and unmasking him. Peter escaped and defeats Octavius. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] melts Octavius' mechanical arms in front of him and instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterwards to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the ''[[Hobgoblin (comics)|Ultimate Hobgoblin]]'' story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Osborn.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Vol 1 #75</ref>

* In the early script for the aborted Spider-Man film from [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon]], which was written by Ted Newsom and [[John Brancato]], the variation on the origin story had Otto Octavius as a teacher and mentor to a college-aged Peter Parker. The cyclotron accident which "creates" Spider-Man also deforms the scientist into Doctor Octopus and results in his mad pursuit of proof of the Fifth Force. "Doc Ock" reconstructs his cyclotron and causes electromagnetic abnormalities, anti-gravity effects, and bilocation which threatens to engulf New York City and the world.

* The ''Spider-Man'' films' director [[Sam Raimi]] has stated that Doctor Octopus was intended to appear in the [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|first film]] and team up with the Green Goblin, but was not included because Raimi thought it "wouldn't do the movie justice to have a third origin in there".<ref>{{cite video|title = Making The Amazing|format = DVD|publisher = Sony|date = 2004}}</ref>

Initially a well-meaning scientist working with [[Oscorp]] to develop a form of self-sustainable energy that would benefit mankind, Octavius turns to villainy after his experiment goes wrong, resulting in Rosie's death and Octavius losing control of his tentacle harness' [[artificial intelligence]], which begins to influence his mind and actions and brings him into conflict with [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Spider-Man]].

Founding his own company, Octavius Industries, he worked to perfect prosthetic limb technology, motivated by a neurological disorder he was developing. Octavius later employed [[Peter Parker (Insomniac Games character)|Peter Parker]] as his lab assistant and eventually became aware of his activities as Spider-Man, but chose to hide this from him.
