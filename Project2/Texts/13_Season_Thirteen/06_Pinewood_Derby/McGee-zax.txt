Who wants it next, huh?!  I'm on the lam. Got the entire Federation of Planets after me. But they ain't gonna catch me, ya got that?! They might have busted my warp drive, but you obviously know how to make 'em!  I can kill any mug on this two-bit planet I want!  You build me a new warp drive or you're all gonna get it, see?! What's takin' so long?! You're stallin'! Alright, that does it!  Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police. You'd better get rid of 'em or your whole planet is gonna get it, see?!  I don't need it painted, I just need it functional, all right?!  I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for! What are you two whispering about, riiight? My real name is Kevern Zaksor. I am the ambassador to new planet testing.
