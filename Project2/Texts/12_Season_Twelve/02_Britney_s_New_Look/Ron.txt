 This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight. The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado , who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars. Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates. A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise!  Oooooh, ouch!  Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news. Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.
