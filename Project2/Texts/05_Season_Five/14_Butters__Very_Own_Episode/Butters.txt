Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya. It's a-  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty. Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!  That's me.  That's me. .  Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.  We won't know until we're at Bennigan's. Dad's a good shopper all right. You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'? Sure I do!   Uh, that's me!  Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.  "White Swallow Bath House"  Uh, that's me! I'm back, Ma! I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out. Well first, he went to see a movie. I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  "Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8. Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him. To the gym. Yeah. The White Swallow Spa. Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight! Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?  Uh, that's me! Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.  Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom? Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him.   That's me! One please. Uh thanks!   Dad, you in here? Hello? Eh-anybody in here? Uh, Mr. Garrison?  Dad? Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Hi Dad!  I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad? Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home.   That's me!  Uh, hey Dad.  Well, sure thing, Dad. Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so. Little white lies? ...Uh, who's Jack? Oh no, that won't happen, Dad. Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine. A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?  Oh boy, a drive! Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along. Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too. Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself. Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here. Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.   That's me! Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?  That's me!  That's me! And so then my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister. Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this? Uh, is this the Stotch residence? ...No.  ...No.  That's me! Sir? Hello? Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar. I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow. Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road?   and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em. Oh jeez.   That's me! Happy Anniversary! Oh.  Alright, then. I- Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was- I ain't grounded, am I? Lie? Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary. Uh stop it, Mom and Dad. Now gosh darn it, you!  Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I? ...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?  Yeah! Yeah!   wait, what? Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ! Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now. I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay. Naw, I'm lyin' Wuh comin', Dad!   That's me!
