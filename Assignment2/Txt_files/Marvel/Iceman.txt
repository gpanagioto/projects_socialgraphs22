'''Iceman''' ('''Robert Louis''' "'''Bobby'''" '''Drake''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] and is a founding member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #1 (Sept. 1963). Iceman is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with superhuman abilities. He has the ability to manipulate ice and cold by freezing [[water vapor]] around him. This allows him to freeze objects, as well as cover  his body with  [[ice]].

Iceman has a relatively high profile among ''X-Men'' characters due to being frequently adapted into X-Men and [[Spider-Man]]-related media, including video games, animated series, and films. From 2000 to 2014, [[Shawn Ashmore]] portrayed Iceman in the [[20th Century Fox]] [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]] and voiced the character in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]''. The character later received widespread media attention when a storyline revealed that the character was a [[closeted]] [[gay]] man in ''[[All-New X-Men]]'' #40 (April 2015), leading to his [[coming out]]. Today Iceman is notable for being one of the most prominent [[LGBT themes in comics|gay characters in comic books]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963 in comics#September|September 1963]]). Lee later admitted that Iceman was created essentially as a copy of the [[Human Torch]], only using the opposite element for his power.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = Patrick Daniel | last2 = Lee | first2 = Stan | author-link2 = Stan Lee | date = August 1993 | title = X Marks the Spot | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | pages = 8–9 | quote = Then I wanted a character sort of like the Torch. What's opposite of fire? Ice. Water might have been the opposite, but I couldn't think of anything to do visually with water. I felt a little guilty because Iceman was such a copy of the Human Torch in an opposite way.}}</ref>

Iceman was featured in two self-titled limited comic book miniseries, one in 1984–85 written by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and another in the 2000s by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett, with art by [[Karl Kerschl]]. DeMatteis said of the first series, "It was my idea, so there was no one to blame but myself. I'll just say that it was a mistake and if the series made any sense whatsoever it was due to [editor] [[Bob Budiansky]]. That was a case where the editor's input was really needed—and Bob was a big help."<ref>{{cite news | first1 = Jim | last1 = Salicrup | first2 = Mike | last2 = Higgins | author-link1 = Jim Salicrup | date = October 1986 | title = J. Marc DeMatteis (part 2) | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = #39 | pages = 7–19 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>

A mainstay in most X-Men titles, Iceman has been a main character in both ''Uncanny X-Men'' and the second volume of ''X-Men'' and was also featured in ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' from 1975 to 1978<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen |title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17–23|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> and ''[[Defenders (comics)|The New Defenders]]'' from 1983 to 1986 as a member. He was a main character in the first volume of ''X-Factor'', and a star in flashback stories when he was a teenager in ''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' and ''X-Men: First Class''.

In April 2015, in issue 40 of ''All-New X-Men'', a time-displaced version of the teenaged Iceman was revealed as [[gay]] by his teammate, [[Jean Grey]], who discerned this with her telepathic ability.<ref>Hanks, Henry.

Retrieved 12 June 2015.</ref> This raised questions, because the character's adult, present-day counterpart had previously been portrayed dating women. In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #600, which was published in November that year, the young Iceman confronts his older self, who confirms that he is gay as well but repressed his true self, not wanting to be both gay and a mutant.<ref>Wong, Curtis M.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Robert Louis "Bobby" Drake was born in [[Floral Park, New York|Floral Park]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to William Robert Drake and Madeline Beatrice Bass-Drake. His father is [[Irish-American]] [[Catholic]], and his mother is [[Jewish-American|Jewish]].<ref>''Iceman'' #1 (Dec. 1984)</ref> Bobby's powers first manifested when he was on a date with Judy Harmon, and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tried to take Judy away for himself. Knowing Judy could not put up a good fight, Bobby pointed his hand at Beasely and encased him in a block of ice. Later, the local townspeople, having heard of the incident, came looking for him in the form of an angry mob. The local sheriff had no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own "protection". While Bobby sat in his cell at the sheriff station, the outer wall was blown open, and a young man named [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] walked in and offered to take Bobby with him. After Bobby turned him down, the two mutants got into a short battle, which was soon ended by the arrival of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #44–46</ref>

After Xavier spoke with Bobby and his parents, Bobby's parents suggested that he go with Professor Xavier to his "school for gifted youngsters". Bobby took the suggestion and left with Professor Xavier and Cyclops to become the second member of the [[X-Men]]. He is later joined by [[Beast (comics)|Henry "Hank" McCoy]], [[Jean Grey]], and [[Warren Worthington III]] as the founding members of the X-Men. Drake remains self-conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group. Appearing in his original snow covered form, he first battles [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] along with the rest of the team,<ref>''The X-Men'' #1</ref> and later the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #4</ref> Bobby Drake's first girlfriend is Zelda.<ref>''The X-Men'' #7</ref> Not long after, he takes on a new ice-covered form.<ref name="X8">''The X-Men'' #8 (November 1964)</ref> He then teams up with the [[Human Torch]] for the first time.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #120</ref> The two would become close friends as time went on. With the X-Men, he visits the [[Savage Land]] and meets [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] for the first time.<ref>''The X-Men'' #10</ref> He then battles the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]],<ref>''The X-Men'' #13</ref> and is badly injured in his first battle against the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #14–17</ref> He next battles Magneto by himself.<ref>''The X-Men'' #18</ref> Later, he visits [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]] for the first time.<ref>''The X-Men'' #34</ref> Then, he and Beast battle the [[Maha Yogi]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #47</ref> During his original stint with the X-Men, Drake pursues a relationship with [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Lorna Dane]], although the relationship does not last. Iceman is among the original X-Men captured by [[Krakoa]], leading to a new incarnation of X-Men of which he is not a member. With most of the original team, he quits the X-Men.<ref>''The X-Men'' #94</ref>

===Champions and Defenders===
Iceman moves to the American west coast to attend [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and becomes a founding member of [[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]] of Los Angeles.<ref>''The Champions'' #1 (Oct. 1975)</ref> However, the Champions soon dissolve.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #17</ref>

Iceman is then abducted by [[Master Mold]], and alongside Angel, he encounters the [[Hulk]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #7</ref> Iceman next aids the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in battling the [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #76</ref> Drake retires from life as a superhero to earn a college degree in accounting – but apparently at a college on the east coast, not UCLA.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #145, p. 10, panel 1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While in college, he briefly rejoins the X-Men to rescue the captives of [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s henchman, Miss Locke.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #145–146</ref>

Iceman is reunited with Beast, encounters Cloud, and then returns as a full-time superhero in an incarnation of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] alongside his former teammates, Angel and Beast.<ref>''The Defenders'' #122–123, 125</ref> He also battles [[Professor Power]]'s [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] while with the Defenders.<ref>''The Defenders'' #127–129</ref> After the Defenders disband, Drake embarks on his career as an accountant.

Some time later, Iceman encounters Mirage, the "daughter" of Oblivion. Iceman journeys back in time and meets his parents before he was born, and battles Oblivion and Mirage. He then reconciles with his parents.<ref>''Iceman'' #1–4</ref>

===X-Factor===
The original X-Men, including Iceman, reunite to form the superhero team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #1 (February 1986)</ref> With this new team, he encounters [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Factor'' #6</ref>

During his time with the team, [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] captures Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Loki enhances Bobby's powers and then extracts them to restore the size of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Iceman is rescued by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' #377–378</ref> Loki's tampering increases Bobby's powers to such an extent that he begins to lose control of his abilities. During a later battle with the [[The Right (comics)|Right]], he is fitted with a power-dampening belt which actually helps him control his abilities. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby finds he can encase the entirety of the [[Empire State Building]]. With time, Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers and is able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he has achieved his full potential, Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further.

With X-Factor, Bobby then defeats [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Apocalypse's Horsemen]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #19</ref> Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes, something he once was. Most notably, he and Beast help [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] gain a more normal life. For a brief while, he also helps supervise the [[New Mutants]] and their sister team, the [[X-Terminators]]. They, in turn, save him from the deadly kiss of [[Infectia]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #29–31</ref>

Bobby also develops a romantic relationship with [[Opal Tanaka]]. After a session of ice sledding, she discovers threatening mail in her mailbox, a precursor to harassment by her cybernetically enhanced relatives of the Tatsu Clan of the Yakuza, which Bobby helps her out with.<ref>''X-Factor'' #63–64</ref>

After the "[[Muir Island Saga]]", Iceman rejoins the X-Men along with the rest of X-Factor.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281; ''X-Men'' #1</ref>

===Back with the X-Men===
When he rejoined the X-Men it seemed that he learned to control his powers and no longer needed the inhibitor belt, this made him believe he reached the limit of his powers.<ref>''X-Factor'' #70</ref> The X-Men were separated into two groups, Iceman was placed in the gold team, led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], along with fellow original X-Men Jean Grey (now without a code name) and Archangel.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281</ref>

One day he took Opal to eat with his parents, however his dad began humiliating her because of her Japanese heritage. The four are attacked by the Cyber-Samurai, which added to William Drake's prejudices about the girl.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #289</ref> When Bobby came across [[Mikhail Rasputin]] he used his mutant abilities on him. Bobby discovered that his potential was still far from being reached as he converted his body into ice, not just covered by it.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #292</ref> By turning his entire body to ice, instead of just wearing an icy exterior, Bobby now was capable of using his power in new, aggressive ways, adding spikes and padding to his ice structure.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #300</ref>

Too busy with the many threats that the X-Men faced every day, Bobby let his relationship with Opal deteriorate and, when they finally saw each other again after weeks, it was only to save her from an attack by mutant haters. Annoyed that she could only gain his attention by nearly getting killed, Opal broke off their relationship.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #305</ref>

Later, as he was checking on [[Emma Frost]] who was in a comatose state after the mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting Sentinels on Emma Frost and her students known as the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], the mansion was hit by an electricity breakdown.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #311</ref> Emma woke up disoriented, possessed Bobby's mind, and used his powers in ways Bobby never had; she froze an entire river and traveled through water. She was looking for her pupils but after finding out they were dead, she left Bobby's body.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #314</ref>

Bobby invites Rogue to tag along on a visit to his parents. Wrongly assuming a romantic relation, his father disapproves of Rogue, verbally attacking them with the same prejudices he expressed with Opal. This time, Bobby had enough and left after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal. He was upset that Emma exhibited greater control of his powers than he had. Since Rogue was having problems with Gambit, the two of them go on a road trip to ease their minds.<ref name="Uncanny319"/>

During the Legion Quest, Iceman was one of the X-Men who went back in time to stop [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from killing Magneto. They succeed, but only partially. Legion does not kill Magneto, but instead accidentally murdered Xavier, his own father, years before Legion had been conceived much less born. This paradox caused the events of the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. At the last moment before the original reality ended, Iceman's fellow X-Men, Rogue and Gambit shared a kiss. When reality resumed, Rogue's mind-absorbing touch renders Gambit comatose. Having absorbed some secret haunting memories, she needs to get away from the X-Men and Iceman volunteers to join her on a road trip, though at the same time he was starting to see visions of Emma Frost. When Gambit awoke from his coma, he tracked them down and confronted Rogue about what she saw in his mind. She broke off their relationship, Iceman and Gambit returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #45</ref>

When the entity known as [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] first appeared, Iceman was chosen as one of his test subjects, along with Storm, Cyclops and Wolverine. They were pitted against a servant of Onslaught named [[Post (comics)|Post]], in a specific battle area of harsh environment to test the extent of their abilities. They won and were returned to the mansion. However, Iceman's chest had been shattered in his ice form during battle, making it impossible to change back to human form.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> He confronted Emma Frost and demanded to know what she did to his powers in his body and how to save himself. She refused to help since she knew that Bobby would have to do it himself. When he captured her with his ice powers, she telepathically showed him his insecurities. By confronting Opal and his father in her simulation, Iceman realized that Emma was right and managed to transform back to his human body with his chest fully intact.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #331">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #331</ref>

When Graydon Creed was running for President (with a heavy anti mutant campaign), Bobby was chosen to infiltrate in the campaign. His father stood out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants, which came as a surprise to Bobby. His father's connection with Bobby was discovered, so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him to death. Bobby decided to stay away from the X-Men for a while to be with his dad.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #340</ref>

Zero Tolerance came across and Bobby found and helped Cecilia Reyes who was trying to keep a secret that she was a mutant. They also joined with Charlotte Jones and the Morlock Marrow. After Bastion was defeated, he took Cecilia and Marrow to the mansion, and soon left the X-Men again for a while to be with his parents.<ref>''X-Men'' #69</ref>

Much later, the X-Men found evidence in one of Destiny's journals of a group known as the Twelve, including Xavier, Magneto, Cyclops, Phoenix, Iceman, Polaris, Storm, Cable, Bishop, Sunfire, Mikhail Rasputin and the [[Living Monolith]]. They also learned that the Apocalypse's Horsemen had been kidnapping these mutants from around the globe. Iceman was captured in the woods near his home by Deathbird, who had become the Horseman War.<ref>''X-Men'' #96</ref> Gathering the remaining Twelve, the X-Men traveled to Egypt and confronted Apocalypse and the Skrulls. Apocalypse and his forces captured all of the Twelve during the battle, using them in a ritual to give the Chaos-Bringer a new body and incredible power. Magneto and Polaris created opposite magnetic polarities, Iceman, Storm, and Sunfire provided elemental extremes, Cyclops, Phoenix, and Cable gave the sheer power of family, Xavier represented the power of mind and Bishop and Mikhail stood for time and space, while the Monolith linked all their energies together. Nate Grey was to be Apocalypse's new host, a powerhouse to store his massive lifeforce. The Twelve managed to free themselves and Cyclops sacrificed his own body and life force to keep Apocalypse from getting Nate. Though the new Apocalypse was defeated, Cyclops seemed lost forever.<ref>''X-Men'' #97</ref>

After that incident, Iceman helped the Beast to secretly enter Genosha, as he wanted to study the legacy-infected mutates. When the High Evolutionary released his anti-mutation wave, they were trapped in the war-ravaged country. With the aid of Magneto, they escaped and joined forces with the rest of the scattered X-Men. They raided the Evolutionary's satellite, disabled the mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #379</ref><ref>''X-Men'' #99</ref><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #380</ref>

Iceman was recruited by the living ship [[Prosh (Marvel Comics)|Prosh]], along with other mutants, like Jean Grey, Mystique, Toad and Juggernaut, to preserve evolution and save it. In this journey Iceman developed his powers even further, which led him to no longer be afraid of the natural course of his powers and he returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #1–5</ref> He joined a new team of X-Men, consisting of Angel, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Wolverine and Chamber. He was using his abilities in a whole new way now, just channelling the power and not turning his body into ice.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #395</ref>

===Second mutation===
{{MOS|date=March 2015}}
During a heated battle with a recently evolved [[Black Tom Cassidy]], he received a chest wound. After returning to normal his chest did not fully recover and some parts of it remained icy, and he was unable to return them to normal. At first he became afraid of it but in time it made him gain a new attitude in life, even rude at some times.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #413</ref>

Nobody seemed to realize it at the time, but evidently this was an early sign of Iceman undergoing a secondary mutation of his own. When he repeatedly tried to evade his regular medical check-ups, school nurse [[Annie Ghazikhanian]] recognized that something odd was going on with him and pressured him to show her the wound. Bobby made her promise not to tell anyone and showed her that parts of his chest are now made of ice and he is unable to change them back to flesh and blood. Iceman wonders if he will entirely turn into ice on a permanent basis.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #415">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #415</ref>

He developed an attitude that, to some of the newer addition to the X-Men, like [[Stacy X]], [[Juggernaut (Marvel Comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], he comes across as rather arrogant, denouncing their status as team members, as they have not been around as long as he. Iceman even went as far as offending [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] by claiming that only the original five, and no one else, has the right to call themselves an X-Man.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #420</ref>

Bobby was further frustrated when Havok and Polaris announced their imminent wedding, him having carried a torch for Lorna for quite some time. In his frustration he turned to Annie, who had problems with the wedding too, as she was secretly in love with Havok. The nurse surprised him with the accusation of him being a racist – feeling comfortable as a mutant who could pass like a human when needed, opposed to being a fully obvious mutant or a "mere" human. With his secondary mutation manifesting, though, Iceman was in danger of losing this status. Shocked by the truth of her words, Bobby fully opened up about his fears, that as a man fully made of ice he could never feel the warmth of a physical relationship again. Touched, Annie allowed him to kiss her, but when Havok called off the wedding, wanting to be with Annie instead, she quickly dumped Bobby.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #426">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #426</ref>

Upon encountering [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] and his followers, Iceman's body is shattered from the neck down. Afterward, he regains his entire ice form, but cannot change back to his human appearance. As a result, Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #429">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #429</ref>

===Rogue's Team===
Iceman joins [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s team after she tells him that she wants him as a member.{{issue|date=March 2018}} Their first mission as a team is to fight a new threat, a powerful group known as the [[Children of the Vault]].<ref>''X-Men'' #188 (July 2006)</ref> The team is successful and during this time, Bobby learns that he can be completely destroyed but then pull himself back together again. It was shown several times during the arc.

The next mission for the team was to locate a man called Pandemic and defeat him. The team was again successful, but Rogue was infected with a virus called Strain 88. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] took the team, including Bobby, to his island so Rogue could get treatment.<ref>''X-Men'' #194–197</ref>

While on Cable's island, the team and Iceman began working to defeat the [[Shi'ar]] weapon known as the Hecatomb. During the chaos, he shared a passionate kiss with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<ref name="X-Men vol. 2 #190">''X-Men'' #190</ref> Even as he did so, he saved many lives by containing the explosion of the Conquistador, and, later, the Hecatomb itself.<ref>''X-Men'' #199</ref>

===Blinded by the Light===
As the team recovers from Hecatomb attack in Rogue's childhood home, it appears that Mystique and Iceman begin a romantic relationship.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #200</ref> This was a front, as Mystique was using Iceman and the X-Men as a [[Marauders (comics)|Marauder]] spy for [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>''X-Men'' #201</ref> Marauders soon infiltrated the house; they attempt to gain access to [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Destiny's Diaries]] on the order of Mr. Sinister (who has been gathering information about the future from anybody and anything that could foretell the future). Bobby and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] escape from the Marauders in the [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]], with help from [[Emma Frost]]. They are pursued by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner, but not before he manages to cripple the jet. While Sunfire is unconscious, Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders' plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny's Diaries before the Marauders can. During this time, Bobby displayed sub-atomic control of energy transfers when he prevented Sunfire from using his fire-based powers.<ref>''X-Men'' #202</ref>

Cannonball and Bobby, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempt to recover the diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. Mr. Sinister uses the reverse-engineered version of Xavier's [[Cerebro]] to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attack Cannonball and Iceman and overtake them. Bobby, while in his ice form, suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique, which severs one of his arms above the elbow. Mister Sinister, who takes Cannonball prisoner, attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X-Men will find him as an empty shell. Iceman attacks Sinister, distracting him, which allows both of the X-Men to escape.<ref>''X-Men'' #203</ref>

===Messiah Complex===
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
The [[New X-Men (2004 series)|New X-Men]] team decided to raid the headquarters of the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] in Washington, D.C., but were forced to retreat. [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] teleported them back to the mansion in a rush, but the entire team was scattered between D.C. and Westchester. Iceman, after recovering from his injuries, volunteered to go look for them and was given telepathic directions by [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #45</ref>

Iceman was successful in finding the New X-Men, most of them injured. On the way back, they found that the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E* Sentinels]] guarding the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]] had become infected by nano-Sentinels and attacked the school. Iceman and New X-Man [[X-23]] helped out in the battle with the O*N*E* Sentinels. With the help of [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] and X-23, the X-Men were able to survive this battle but the nano-Sentinel infected human escaped.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #493</ref>

Soon, Iceman participated in the final battle against the Marauders, the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], and [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]]. He was one of the X-Men who came running in to fight Predator X after it swallowed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] whole. However, he also witnesses his mentor, Professor Xavier, "killed" by Bishop's bullet, which was not meant for him.<ref>''X-Men'' #207</ref>

===Divided We Stand===

===Fantastic Four Returns===
Iceman is among the heroes summoned by [[Mr. Fantastic]] - a group consisting of former substitute members of the [[Fantastic Four]] - to help the [[Future Foundation]] against the cosmic entity known as the Griever. However, the [[Human Torch]] objects to Iceman's presence during the battle, emphatically asserting that Iceman was ''never'' a member of the FF. Iceman states that he ''was'' made a member during an adventure involving Namor. The Torch simply counters with "''That didn't COUNT!''"<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 6 #2–4</ref>

As recounted in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 6 #24, Iceman's induction into the FF did not feature Namor, but occurred during the early days of the FF and the original X-Men. One morning years ago, the youthful Torch 'quit' the FF in an immature fit of pique. That same day, the sensitive teen-aged Iceman left the X-Men after being laughed at by his peers for his poor showing in a [[Danger Room]] exercise. Iceman encountered the remaining FF members and assisted them with a day-long series of crises, being casually admitted to the team as a result. When the Torch discovered that he had been replaced, he attacked Iceman during the FF's current battle and forcefully declared that Iceman was ''not'' an FF member. The [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]] forced the pair to work together to help defeat the FF's final opponent of the day. Iceman was then telepathically summoned back to the X-Men by Professor X, who praised his student's performance. Mr. Fantastic told the departing Iceman that he could return to the FF whenever he wanted. The Torch was also 'readmitted', with a penance of a week's laundry detail.<ref name="Fantastic Four vol. 6 #24">''Fantastic Four'' vol. 6 #24</ref>

In the present time, Iceman returns the teen-aged [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin Richards]] to the FF's [[Yancy Street]] home/headquarters from [[Krakoa]] and is recognized by the building's security system as an FF member. This angers the Torch once again, and he declares that Iceman had ''never'' been a member of the team. The two men bicker over the issue until Iceman realizes that the Torch was never upset about Iceman replacing him on the ''team'', but believes that he was trying to take his place in the FF ''family''. The Torch finally admits that what bothered him most was that other substitute members—who were also considered family by the FF—were always brought in due to major events, and that if Iceman was the actual first substitute member, that meant the Torch had given up his place "over nothing." The Torch ultimately drops the matter of Iceman's legitimacy and says that he was an official substitute FF member, and is also a part of the FF 'family'.<ref name="Fantastic Four vol. 6 #24"/>

===Solo series===
After being outed as gay by the time-displaced [[Jean Grey]], the younger time-displaced Iceman confronts his older self, asking him why he has been presenting as straight for most of his adult life. The older Bobby breaks down and admits that he has known he was gay for a long time but forcibly repressed that part of himself, fearful of how others would react. He further acknowledges that he was scared to reveal his true self to the world due to already facing prejudice for being a mutant and not wanting to receive hatred for another part of himself.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #600"/> Following all of this, Bobby decides to take a break from the limelight and focus on himself, declining to join the [[X-Men Gold|new X-team]] formed by [[Kitty Pryde]], instead acting as a reserve member and teaching classes at the Xavier School. After a training session with his younger self, Bobby sees the time-displaced Iceman head out for a date with his boyfriend Romeo while he tries to set up an online dating profile to meet guys. He receives a text from his mother stating that his father has had a heart attack so Bobby rushes to the hospital only to be chastises by his father for missing family events due to his commitments as a superhero. Following a brief battle in the hospital, Bobby's parents ask him to leave, angry that their mutant son is bringing yet more trouble into their lives.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #1</ref> On a mission with Kitty to rescue a new mutant, she confronts Bobby about being gay, asking why he could not tell her himself, meaning she had to find out from a secondary source. She reassures him that she only wants to help him and lets him know she is there if he ever wants to talk but suggests he should come out to his parents. Bobby arranges dinner with his family but he is constantly subjected anti-mutant rhetoric from his parents. The dinner is interrupted by a gang of [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] but, although Iceman takes them down quickly and the lives of his parents, they are angry that their house has been destroyed because of him and send him away (although his mother promises to try and convince his father to visit him at the X-Mansion).<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #2–3</ref> When the mutant that he and Kitty rescues goes missing, Iceman tracks him to a nearby nightclub where he discovers that [[Daken]] is responsible for luring him away. Daken tries to flirt with Bobby to distract him but Iceman freezes him and attempts to convince the mutant to return to the Xavier School, though he refuses. Daken mocks Bobby, saying that he can smell his fear and insecurity. Upon returning, Kitty surprises Bobby by revealing that his parents have arrived for a visit. He tells them he is gay and they both react negatively, angry that their son is both a mutant and a gay man. They chastise him for letting everyone else find out before them and try to convince him that he is straight, due to having been with women in the past. The family argument is interrupted by [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who attacks the school looking for the [[X-Men Blue|young X-Men]]. Iceman defeats him by pushing his powers and returns to the mansion to find his father is still there. He had obtained Bobby's draft of a coming out letter from Kitty and the two men begin to reconcile.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #4–5</ref>

Bobby reconnects with his former [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]] teammates, [[Angel (comics)|Angel]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], so they reminisce about their time with [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Bobby runs into a guy, Judah, while out shopping and he agrees to meet him that night at a local gay bar, with the rest of the Champions acting as his wingmen. The date appears to be going well but is interrupted by an attack by some [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #6</ref> Bobby's relationship with Judah continues to develop and he decides to move to L.A. to be closer to him. While fighting [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] with his younger self, Bobby explains that his mother has finally made contact with him for the first time since he came out and that she wants to invite both of them to dinner. Time-displaced Iceman agrees on the condition that Bobby tries to talk sense into Romeo, who hasn't called him in weeks. Meanwhile, Daken begins training his new mutant protégée for a secret mission. When both the younger Bobby and the older Bobby arrive at the restaurant, their parents see the younger Bobby as a chance to raise a new son in a way that suits them but the time-displaced Iceman refuses, saying that he is still gay and wants to live life on his own terms before they both storm out.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #8</ref> During Bobby's moving away party at the X-Mansion, Daken uses the Purifiers to distract the other X-Men while he and his apprentice infiltrate the school and ambush Bobby. The young mutant uses his levelled-up powers to increase Daken's strength by turning him into [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] horseman Death and he mortally wounds Judah with his claws before engaging Iceman in combat. Bobby manages to defeat Daken with a kiss which freezes Death's powers but Daken escapes and Judah breaks up with Bobby because his life is too much for him to deal with.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #10</ref>

After teaming with [[Bishop (X-Men)|Bishop]] to help the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] who came under threat by [[Mister Sinister]], Bobby finds himself approached by [[Emma Frost]] who asks him for his help. Ignoring Kitty's protests, he agrees and Emma explains that her Father, who subjected her brother [[Christian Frost|Christian]] to conversion therapy before having him institutionalized, has recently let him out and reinstalled him as the new heir to the Frost business empire. When they arrive, they discover that Christian has murdered their Father and is exhibiting his own powers. Bobby and Emma help to free Christian from his mental breakdown and Emma decides to stay with him.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 4 #1–2</ref> Joining with his friends [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], Bobby discovers that Sinister was behind the attack on the Morlocks and confronts him in his safehouse.

Ice Wizard warns Bobby that he must quit the X-Men and stop using his powers to avoid a world-destroying series of events happening. He explains that Daken seduces him and manipulates him into sacrificing the other X-Men before betraying him and gaining [[Thanos]]-level powers. Bobby is adamant that this won't happen and the two engage in battle. [[Jean Grey]] arrives and Bobby finally confronts her for the actions of her younger self when she outed him. Bobby explains to Ice Wizard that he is going to live life on his terms and that nobody, not even his future self, is going to decide for him. Bobby returns to his birthday celebration where Christian arrives and hands him a large sum of money which Bobby gives to the Morlocks. A content Bobby messages Judah, asking if he would like to meet up as friends.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men: Winter's End''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Iceman possesses the power to instantly decrease the temperature of ambient [[water vapor]] in his immediate environment to below zero degrees Celsius, thereby freezing it into ice. He is able to make ice that will not break unless he wills it to. In this manner he is able to quickly form a great variety of ice structures, including projectiles, shields, ladders, baseball bats, etc. Iceman often makes ice slides which form rapidly beneath and behind his feet, moving him along the slick surface at high speeds.  He is also able to form exceedingly complicated structures within relative short time, such as miniature cities.<ref name="Uncanny319">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #319</ref> Originally, Iceman's own body temperature would lower dramatically when his powers were active, reaching {{convert|-105|°F|°C|abbr=on}} within a few tenths of a second (now his body usually converts to organic ice; see below). Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures; he is also able to perceive the [[thermal energy]] level of objects around him. Because [[cold]] is the absence of heat, Iceman does not actually 'emanate' cold; rather, he decreases thermal energy. As mentioned by writer [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]], Iceman is "an [[Omega-level mutant]]&nbsp;... [and] has powers that can influence the ecosystem of the entire world."<ref name="Carey"/> Iceman has yet to tap into his full mutant potential, but over the years he has taken more interest in developing his abilities.{{issue|date=May 2015}}

In his early appearances, Iceman generally covered his body in a thick layer of what appeared to be snow; hence he looked more like a traditional snowman than an ice-man. Upon further training in the use of his powers, he was able to fashion an armor of solid ice around his body when using his powers, which afforded him some degree of protection against concussive force and projectiles. Later on, he manifested the ability to convert the tissue of his body into organic ice. He sometimes augments his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists. Iceman has also been able to move rapidly to another distant location while in his organic ice form, being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes (by temporarily merging his molecules with those of the river). On one occasion, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury while in his ice form and was able to heal himself by converting back into his normal human form.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

Iceman is also able to reconstitute his organic ice form if any part of it is damaged, or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself. He can temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own, increasing his mass, size, and strength. He can survive not only as ice, but as liquid water and water vapor. He can also transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid, although it is physically and mentally taxing.<ref name="X-Men vol. 2 #190"/><ref>''X-Men'' #193</ref> Iceman can also freeze sea water, as seen during the "[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]" [[story arc]]. While he usually does not use his powers in lethal ways, his powers are so vast that they extend to the molecular level, to the point that he can freeze all of the molecules of an object/being with a thought; he once froze every single molecule of water within the body of [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]].<ref>''X-Men'' #41</ref> Iceman is also able to dissolve his own icy constructs.<ref name="Uncanny319"/>

Iceman's powers were pushed to their limit while possessed by Emma Frost, who used Iceman to discover the fate of her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]]. During this time Iceman was able to control all forms of moisture, freeze fluids inside people's bodies, travel as a liquid, solid or gas. Not even the combined might of the X-Men Gold team was able to stop Emma Frost in Iceman's body.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #313–314</ref> Following this, Bobby confronted Emma about how she was able to use his powers so effectively. While together they made some initial progress, she refused to train him further.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #331"/> Instead he turned to Storm because they share similar elemental powers and she agreed to tutor him.<ref>''X-Men'' #48</ref>

When Iceman was injected with Mister Sinister's neuro-inhibiter by Mystique, he was able to save himself by drawing in all of the ambient moisture around him, rapidly replacing his poisoned cells with healthy material before the injection could kill him.<ref name="X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3">''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3</ref>

During the 2013–2014 "[[Battle of the Atom]]" storyline, Iceman's future self revealed that he has the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own,<ref name="WolX37">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #37</ref> although one of these structures—demonstrating a Hulk-like physique and intellect—has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood.<ref name="WolX38">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #38</ref>

Aside from his superhuman powers, Iceman is also a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received combat training at Xavier's School as well as coaching from the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] while serving with the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions of Los Angeles]]. Iceman has taken as much combat training as Cyclops or Beast.<ref name="Carey">Richards, Dave (28 August 2008).

==Characterization==

===Personality===
According to writer Mike Carey "one of Iceman's best personality traits is that emotionally Bobby Drake is like the ice he manipulates—not cold but transparent. 'He's devastatingly honest. He is very up-front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time.'"<ref name="Carey"/> "Also, he's obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external, physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes."<ref name="Carey"/>

===Friendships and relationships===
Iceman had a brief relationship with a Japanese-American New Yorker named Opal Tanaka. He subsequently exhibited strong feelings for his fellow X-Man [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], but she did not return those feelings, due to her feelings towards Havok. [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] developed an unrequited crush for Iceman during their time on the same team, though Iceman never did find out about this.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #415"/> Iceman later had a brief relationship with the Xavier School's nurse, Annie, but she eventually left him for Havok, who had just left Polaris at the altar.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #426"/> When Iceman attempted to rekindle his relationship with Polaris, that too ended abruptly, and Polaris returned to Havok.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #429"/> Iceman then had a relationship with the X-Men's enemy Mystique, who later betrayed him, despite her continued fixation on him, in as much as she stated that she would either kill him or cure him of his personal uncertainty.<ref name="X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3"/>

Iceman has long-lasting friendships with [[Spider-Man]], [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and the [[Human Torch]].

===Sexuality===
In ''All-New X-Men'' #40, the time-displaced Iceman is revealed to be gay, which eventually forces the youth to confront the adult version of himself about the matter. As both speak, the adult Iceman confirms the fact and that he had put all his energy into just being an X-Man as he couldn't cope with being a mutant and gay simultaneously. With the help of his younger self and Jean Grey, however, he finally comes to terms with his own sexuality,<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #600"/> and comes out to fellow gay X-Man [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] in ''Extraordinary X-Men'' #6. The end of the Extermination X-Men event saw the redirecting of the time displaced version of Bobby back into the "closet" when he returned to his original timeline alongside the other X-Men, due to a mind lock by Jean Grey. In the present day, the current version retains both sets of memories and remains an out gay man.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/extermination-x-men-breakdown/|title=Extermination: Every Major Change Made to the X-Men|date=28 December 2018|website=CBR}}</ref>

Following the [[Avengers Vs. X-Men|war with the Phoenix Five]], as Cyclops begins to lash out against government oppression of mutants, a chance comment by Bobby about how the old Cyclops wouldn't tolerate what he is currently doing inspires Beast to travel back in time and recruit [[Uncanny X-Men#1963–1970: Original run|the original five X-Men]] to stop Cyclops.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #1</ref> The team decides to stay in the present instead of returning into the past.{{issue|date=June 2016}} They are now called the [[All-New X-Men]] and led by [[Kitty Pryde]].{{issue|date=June 2016}} The past and present Bobby are particularly shocked when they see each other.

Later, the younger, time-displaced Bobby is forced to confront being gay by his teammate, Jean, who privately asks him why he calls women "hot", when she knows via her psychic abilities that he is gay. This causes the younger Bobby to speculate as to the complicated identity issues faced by his older self and the decisions his older self may have made in the time between them.<ref name="All-New X-Men #40">''All-New X-Men'' #40</ref> Together with the young Jean, the young Bobby confronts his older self, who admits to being gay, having 'concealed' that part of himself so that he could have avoid being prejudiced against for another part of himself.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #600">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #600</ref>

Bobby joins the time-displaced Cyclops, Angel and Beast, as well as [[Kid Apocalypse]], [[All-New Wolverine]] and [[Oya (comics)|Oya]] as they road-trip around America trying to make their own mark on the world. Bobby is initially reluctant to talk about his sexuality with his teammates until Oya and Kid Apocalypse take him to a gay club in an attempt to make him more comfortable. He embarrasses himself and runs into Romeo, an Inhuman with the ability to manipulate and feel others' emotions. Romeo makes Bobby more comfortable and the two begin a relationship.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' vol. 2 #13</ref> The two are later caught in the middle when [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|the X-Men declare war on the Inhumans]].{{issue|date=May 2019}} Bobby joins the X-Men when they attack New Attilan but quickly breaks off from the battle to find Romeo, with the two escaping together.{{issue|date=May 2019}}

====X-Men Blue====
{{Main|X-Men Blue}}
After the [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|X-Men's war against the Inhumans for the Terrigen]] ends, Iceman joins the rest of the young X-Men on an attempted return to their original timeline but they quickly realize that theirs isn't part of the [[Earth 616]] timeline, leaving them stuck in that present time with no knowledge where they were originally from.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' vol. 3 #19</ref> Upon learning this, Iceman joins the rest of the young X-Men and leaves the rest of the X-Men to find their place in the world.<ref>''X-Men: Prime'' #1</ref> Iceman then joins Magneto in [[Madripoor]] along with the rest of the time-displaced X-Men; however, due to a lack of trust in their new leader, the X-Men make plans and train in case Magneto returns to his former villainous ways to kill them. Instead of training with his teammates, Iceman spends most of his time trying to reach out Romeo unsuccessfully, placing him into a stupor.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #2</ref>

The time-displaced X-Men continue fighting crime in the present day although following a battle with the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] from an alternate timeline, they are disheartened to realize that they must eventually return to their original time. This particularly upsets Bobby who is sad that all of their growth as people will be undone once they go back. While the team are in space working alongside [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] to defeat the Poisons, a race of mind-controlling [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]], Magneto attacks several [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] parties searching for [[Emma Frost]]. The X-Men find her first and offer to protect her from Magneto although they quickly discover that he had taken mutant growth hormones to enhance his powers and, rather than kill the team he has mentored, Magneto leaves. Young Jean senses that they must return to their own time period soon and the X-Men have heart-to-hearts with their adult selves. During a game of pool with older Iceman, Bobby breaks down, knowing that his memory of the present must be erased and he will be forced back into the closet and, despite Iceman's best efforts to convince his younger self that he will grow up to be someone awesome, Bobby admits that he likes the person he has already become but that remaining that person is no longer an option. As the team prepare to leave, a news report announces that Magneto has formed a new brotherhood, leading the X-Men to decide to stay in the present for a little while longer.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #29-36</ref>

====Extermination====
{{Main|Extermination (comics)}}

While en route to help young Cyclops, Bobby is attacked by a mysterious assailant but is rescued by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who urges him to flee. Iceman refuses but is incapacitated and captured while Cable is killed. Young Jean attempts to use [[Cerebro]] to locate Bobby but states that she is unable to find him. In a secret lab, the man who attacked Bobby is revealed to be a [[Cable (comics)#Nathan Summers (time-displaced version)|time-displaced version of Cable]] who has him locked up in a tube.<ref>''Extermination'' #1</ref> Kitty gathers all of the X-Men, who split into four teams tasked with protecting one of the remaining time-displaced X-Men. Young Jean uses her telepathy to guide her team to young Cable's base, where he admits to murdering his older self because he had failed in his mission to maintain the timeline by allowing the young X-Men to stay in the present for so long. They discover that Cable has been genetically modifying young Iceman so that he looks the way he looked when he left his original time period. He releases Bobby and teleports them all to [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], where [[Ahab (comics)|Ahab]] is attempting to kill young Cyclops so that the timeline can never be restored. The X-Men find themselves overwhelmed by Ahab's forces and Cable convinces the young X-Men that they must return home immediately in order to save the others. Young Iceman breaks down to his older self, admitting he doesn't want to be forced back into the closet but the present day Bobby tells him that his younger self finally allowed him to accept that he was gay and promises that he will be finally be able to truly be himself when he grows up. Cable then sends the X-Men back to their original time, informing them that everything will return to normal once they officially close the time loop. In 1964, the young X-Men change into their original clothes and young Jean performs a mind wipe so that they won't remember their time in the present day although she informs them that she is able to lock their memories away so that, once the loop is closed, their older selves will regain those memories. Back in modern day, the founding X-Men inherit the memories of their younger selves allowing them to defeat Ahab. Returned to their original time, the young X-Men forget about their adventures in the present and are greeted by Professor Xavier.<ref>''Extermination'' #2-5</ref>

Iceman is Roberto Trefusis in the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', a member of the group of "witchbreeds" founded by [[Carlos Javier (comics)|Carlos Javier]] and led by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scotius Summerisle]]. He is the nephew of naval commander [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. As in the Marvel Universe, he generates ice and can assume a physical ice form.

==="Age of Apocalypse"===
{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, Bobby, along with the rest of the X-Men, is trained by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]].<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1</ref> Because Magneto is harder on his students than [[Professor X]], Bobby lacks his 616-counterpart's sense of humor. Instead, Bobby becomes very cold and inhuman, making his teammates feel uncomfortable. In addition to his normal abilities, Bobby is capable of breaking down his body and merging it with another body of water to travel great distances in a matter of seconds. He can bring others along through a process that he calls "moisture [[Molecule|molecular]] inversion", though it is a painful process for the passengers. Bobby is also able to reconstitute his body from broken pieces. Just before Apocalypse's defeat, Colossus stormed right through Iceman, causing him to fall into pieces in an attempt to reach his sister.{{issue|date=May 2012}} A couple of months later, Iceman, [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] were sent on a secret mission by Magneto; for a time, only Wild Child's fate was revealed.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

Iceman returned in the ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' arc "The Dark Angel Saga", when the title team was forced to travel to the AoA reality.<ref name="auto"/> He abandoned the X-Men during a battle with the minions of Weapon X, who had by this time been transformed into that world's new Apocalypse, a defection later revealed to be the result of Iceman's having lost faith in his X-Men's ability to save their world. He was soon brought to Earth-616 by the Dark Beast, where he joined forces with Archangel on his quest to eradicate all life on Earth so he could create a new evolution process.{{issue|date=December 2011}} Tired of seeing the people he cared about being killed fighting what he thought to be an unwinnable war, Drake agreed to help Archangel – despite the latter's now being the mainstream Marvel Universe's version of Drake's X-Men's arch-enemy, Apocalypse – in exchange for transport to the relative paradise that was Earth-616.{{issue|date=October 2012}}

After X-Force defeated Archangel, Bobby managed to escape with McCoy and most of Archangel's other minions, but eventually broke away from them and went into hiding, living a life of hedonistic bliss in [[Madripoor]]. The "Age of Apocalypse" version of Nightcrawler – who, after being brought to Earth-616 along with the rest of his world's X-Men to help take down Archangel, decided to stay behind there in order to track down and kill the various villains who also came to the mainstream Marvel Universe – eventually tracked Bobby down to execute him for his treason. Nightcrawler is quickly overwhelmed by Drake's avatars, but eventually forces Iceman into a factory boiler room, where there's not enough moisture in the air for him to effectively use his powers. Nightcrawler quickly disables his former friend, and shoves him into an incinerator, killing the once noble hero.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

===''Earth X''===
During the miniseries ''[[Earth X]]'', Bobby had become trapped in his ice form, making him vulnerable to melting.  He moves to the [[Arctic]] regions of Earth, and made an ice city for himself and the [[Inuit]]. Due to a series of events where Earth's orbital path moves, Bobby is able to return to the [[United States]] to aid in the battle against the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].

==="House of M"===
In the alternate timeline of the "[[House of M]]" storyline, Iceman was seen in Magneto's army during his rise to power.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #1</ref> Bobby later appears as one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse#House of M|Horsemen]] of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] because Apocalypse rescued Bobby from a mutant internment camp that his parents had sent him to. Magneto sends Apocalypse to dispose of his rival [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]; when Apocalypse is attacked en route by Black Panther's allies, Iceman aids him by freezing [[Namor]] solid and attempting to attack Storm, but he is severely injured by Sunfire.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #7</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
A zombified Iceman appears in ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' alongside zombies Wolverine and Cyclops.{{issue|date=November 2012}} Ultimately, he is seen attacking Magneto. But Iceman perished at the hands of the Master Of Magnetism himself when Iceman is cut apart.{{issue|date=November 2012}}

===''Mutant X''===
In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] amplified Bobby's powers to a dangerous level, leaving him unable to touch any living thing without killing it. Despite this, he retains a jovial and optimistic personality. When Havok has a disagreement with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and decides to leave the X-Men, Ice-Man is one of those who follow him, becoming a founding member of the Six, who eventually come to be considered the world's premiere mutant team.<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref>

===''New Exiles''===
After the New Exiles land on the world of warring empires, they encounter Dame Emma Frost, head of Britain's Department X and founder of Force-X. This team includes Roberta "Bobby" Drake, a female version of Bobby who is code named Aurion and displays ice-based abilities.<ref>''New Exiles'' #9</ref>

==="Battle of the Atom"===
In the alternate future witnessed in the "[[Battle of the Atom]]" storyline, Iceman's had truly evolved to become Sir Robert, the wizard-like Icemaster. As one of the most respected X-Men, he had incredible control over his powers and could even grow a beard! Though never outright mentioned, he may had a relationship with Kitty Pryde and even fathered a son with her, denoting the existence of Carmen Drake, a boy with the powers of both Iceman and Shadowcat.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #29</ref> He has also developed the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own, although one of these structures, possessing a Hulk-like physique and intellect, has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood, resulting in the Brotherhood using the duplicate to reinforce the illusion of themselves as the future X-Men. The duplicate Iceman was defeated by the O5 Iceman, the present Iceman, and the future Iceman during the battle in the past (Prompting the youngest Iceman to note that they only needed one more Iceman for a five-a-side basketball team).<ref name="WolX37"/>

Icemaster later returned to the mainstream marvel universe and confronts Iceman about trusts and decisions. He does it in order to prevent him from doing the same mistakes Icemaster did in the future. Knowing he had little time left, Icemaster eventually revealed to Iceman that after beginning a relationship with Daken, they both led the X-Men to space in order to prevent the Shi'ar from overwhelm the Earth and lay waste to it. However Icemaster would discover that Daken's plan was actually to obtain the M'Kraan Crystal in the first place, killing in the process the other X-Men and later Deathbird herself. Icemaster attempts to stop Daken, but he is seconds too late as having the Nexus of all Realities made Daken a Thanos-level player in the cosmos, and he acted as such. Icemaster eventually became convinced, after seeing Bobby's character growth, that his present self had matured beyond what he remembered, leaving the future open for new decisions to be made. With his mission apparently completed, Icemaster turns into thin air soon afterwards.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men: Winter's End'' #1</ref>

===Ronin===
In the alternate reality of ''X-Men: Ronin'' Iceman is a murderous ninja in the employ of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].  He works with [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] as part of the 'Shadowcat Clan' and battles the X-Men.

===Spider-Verse===
In ''Edge of Spider-verse: Web of Fear'', a Spider-Man who is a member of the Captain Britain Corps witnesses Morlun about to kill Spider-Man. Later, a larger picture is shown of Firestar and Iceman lying dead, with Ms. Lion being left out, mourning her comrades.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #8</ref>

===Marvel Noir===
Iceman appears in ''[[X-Men Noir]]'' as one of the X Men, a crew of talented criminals. He is depicted as being very short-tempered and paranoid.

While Bobby was away from the X-Men on a vacation, he had a girlfriend, but [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Professor Xavier]] erased all memories of her from Bobby's mind when he told her too much about the X-Men (he presumably also erased the girl's memories).{{issue|date=July 2012}} Upon her acceptance into the X-Men, Bobby begins to date [[Rogue (comics)#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]].{{issue|date=July 2012}} The pair date for a considerable amount of time, but eventually break up due to Bobby's growing feelings for [[Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Shadowcat]] and Rogue's feelings for [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Ultimate Gambit|Gambit]].{{issue|date=July 2012}} Eventually Rogue leaves, and Bobby starts to date Kitty.{{issue|date=July 2012}} After this, the two rekindle their relationship,{{issue|date=July 2012}} but problems erupted.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

The Ultimatum Wave hits the X-Men next killing several of the X-Men (Beast, Dazzler, and Nightcrawler).{{issue|date=July 2012}} Magneto and the Brotherhood attack the world and Iceman helps the world's heroes fight them off.{{issue|date=July 2012}} Most of the X-Men die, but Iceman (alongside Rogue, Storm, Colossus, and Jean Grey) is able to survive Magneto's attack.{{issue|date=July 2012}} He is last seen demolishing the X-Mansion alongside Rogue and Jean Grey and burying the deceased X-Men in its place.{{issue|date=July 2012}} He finds it hard to destroy their home, but he feels it to be the right thing to do now that Professor Xavier is dead.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men: Requiem''</ref>

Without knowing where to go after [[List of Ultimate Spider-Man story arcs#Ultimate Spider-Man (original numbering)|Peter's death]], Bobby Drake asked Kitty Pride if Johnny could come with them searching for a place where to live and hide from authorities.{{issue|date=January 2014}} They found the Morlock Tunnels where they live now and help mutants in danger.
