 Hey, where you been, Eric? Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around!  Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing.  Yeah, but what are we gonna do? Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric? We've got to do something to get rid of her! I knew Eric would come up with a plan!  Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group. Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you? How uh, how is runnin' the country going? Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said? Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build? N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads? Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all. Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches. Okay! Where? Holy moly!
