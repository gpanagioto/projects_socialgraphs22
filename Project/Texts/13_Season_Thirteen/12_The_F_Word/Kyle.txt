This... is exactly what I needed. Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass. Oh, what the hell?!  Yes. Sounds good. Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now. W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of our town. We aren't talking about gay people. Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.  Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag. I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again. We're sorry, Mayor. We gotta run!  Yeah. You definitely made your point. I don't either. Yeah! We did it, you guys!
