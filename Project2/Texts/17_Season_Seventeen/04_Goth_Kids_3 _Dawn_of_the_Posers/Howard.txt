Shhhhh.  Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat. Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody understands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species. Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain. Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King.   You just don't understand. You'll understand them soon. It's quicker if you don't fight it.  You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication. Yes Emo King, right away.  Don't fight it. It's quicker that way.  Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it. Lowe's Home and Garden? No they- they talk to me! But-  What do you mean? YES!!!  Oh my God, are you serious?  No, they really had me convinced! I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot.
