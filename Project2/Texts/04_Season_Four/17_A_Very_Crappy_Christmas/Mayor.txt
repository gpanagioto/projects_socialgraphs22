 Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit! Meugh. Send them in. You do?  An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever! But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.  This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're ''all'' gonna be out of jobs next year. It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.  Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful. Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children.  We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys? Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties. Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back! Fine. Then we'll sue you.  They're starting to understand, Johnson.  Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?
