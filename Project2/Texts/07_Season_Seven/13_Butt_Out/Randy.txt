I don't have a son! Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!  What? Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies.  Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
