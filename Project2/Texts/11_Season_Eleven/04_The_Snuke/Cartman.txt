Uh oh!  Duhude, dude, ''[throws out his arms, palms out] not cool!'' Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo. What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs? No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.  Kyle, are you on your computer? Get online. I need you to check something for me. Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger! Get online now! Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.  Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?  Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?  That's funny. He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.  The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.  I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now! If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this? Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.  Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?! Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow! Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce! Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!  What? Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park! He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away! I said I will only talk to the President! LALALALALALALALA! LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA! President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line? Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now! Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid! Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address? Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready? It's my balls!   Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.  Yes, Mr. Thompson? Why? Did you find something?  A snuke?  I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you? Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you.  Big surprise! Let me have time with him. We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!  Where is the detonator?!  I can do this aaall day. You can make it stop! Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!  Where is your son?! Answer it!  Butters. We got him! I know where he is! No no, he's my lead.  You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is!  Uuugh!   Where is the detonator! You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One! Stop, terrorist, or I ''will'' shoot you!  Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore. Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy! That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading. Uhh yes, of course? The Russians? The Germans? The Germans again? You can't possible mean...? Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology. Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool. But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right? Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America. Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?! Yes or no, Kyle?! But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right?  Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
