I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know. I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat. I really don't care who you are. Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman? I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect.   There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again. This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will- I don't have time for this.   Hello Kyle. Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm. Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.  I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating. Because I think you are the smartest kid in class.  Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos! What next time? Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice ''but'' to unmask myself. No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face.
