You have fun, Stanley. Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol. Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment.  Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut. Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear. Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.   Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet. Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment! Whoopee!
