Who? Who are the Harrisons? Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?! We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.  All right, that does it! I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Harrison is, is a white guy, right?  God-damned religious kooks! Tell ''my'' son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass!  Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison? Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a- Uh, look, I just want to tell you that Well, thanks. Uh... Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son. You know. About... God, and stuff. Well, I... Well, no, no, I just... Y-you can call me... Randy. Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honest, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't}} even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem? Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night. Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America? Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion. All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon! One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening. We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening! And?  Your turn, Sharon. Yes. Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion. Ooo, what's that? Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion. Yeah!
