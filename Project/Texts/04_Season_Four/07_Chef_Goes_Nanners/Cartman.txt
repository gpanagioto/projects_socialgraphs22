Thaaat's ri-ight. Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys! Yes, I do! Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home!   It's okay, I'm here.  Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever. The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.  Mmmm. You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again? Interesting. Aaand, what side are ''we'' on? Whoa! Calm down, ho.  I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone!  O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!  I'll kick ''you'' in the nuts! You won't let me help.  The Bog Monster speaketh.  Uh huh. Why don't we just talk about the swastika? I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,â€¦ obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it. Yeah. Cool. Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs." No way! Me neither.  Huh. Whoa.  Go ahead. Ahh!  Okay, It will be like this forever. Me, too!  Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh. Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.
