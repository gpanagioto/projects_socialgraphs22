You know what? I'll bet it was ''you''! This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself! Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal. It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all. It was him. It ''had'' to have been him! What's this about, Cartman?  That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, ''The Thing''! You saw it in ''The Thing'' and you're wasting everyone's time! Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air! All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test. It doesn't prove anything! No way. Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.  It was me. I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
