Hello there, misterr... Principal, is it? Hm what's bringing you in today?  O-kay, can you describe the ringing? You're hearing a song?  So maybe you're having some feelings for her. Well, I looked, and Hootie & The Blowfish aren't in your ears. I believe you're hearing them in your mind and your heart.
