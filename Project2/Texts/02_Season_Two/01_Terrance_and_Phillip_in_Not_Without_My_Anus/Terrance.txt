Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense.  Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip? That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys. Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument. Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner. Head cancer? Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip.  But we're not gay, Phillip. Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner. Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week. God only knows. It sure is. Let's look for treasure. Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob. Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob. No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? Yes. If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are. Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you. You know I never turn down Kraft Dinner, Phillip. I'm going to put on a pirate costume.  Oh my God! No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran. My daughter. Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty? Oh. Well. It all began fifteen years ago. Yes, indeed.  And I will have to go and find her. You're such a good friend, Phillip. Avast there, mateys. Hello, Celine Dion. You're looking well. Celine, where is our daughter, Sally? Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner. Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return. We just grew apart, Celine Dion.  How's the paper bag working out? Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please. In-deed, Phillip. Same here, Phillip! I Got Ya. Ow, that's rancid. Hahahahaha. Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin. Oh, good. I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance. I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors. Well, enough of Iran, let's get home. Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again. No, you're gaining a pop vocalist. It seems to have changed. What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone? I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say. Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that-- Why?! You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion? What the hell are ''you'' doing here?! Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob! Look at him, Celine Dion. What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!! Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada. Oh, hello, Scott. Hey, Scott. Guess what? Ooh, stop that! Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows. It's so stupid! They look like groundhogs. Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town? Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kroff Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! It sure did, Phillip. Oh, wait. That ''is'' the phone. Hello? Oh.  Hey, it's Scott. Phillip says hello, Scott. You are such a dick, Scott. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick. ''You're'' a dick. I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute? How do you like that, Scott?! Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on? Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.' Oh, wait a second, Scott. Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up. Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure. We're looking for treasure! Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly. That plan's scary! For Canada, Phillip. Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada. That's funny! Why is that? Yes. Apparently, he does. Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea. Well, I guess it's time, old friend. Now, Phlllip? We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks! Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea. Hey, Scott, you like apples?  Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
