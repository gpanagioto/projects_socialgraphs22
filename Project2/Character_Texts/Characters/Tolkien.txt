Yeah, they left. 
What the-? Damn, baby.  
That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster! Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are ''sure'' to win! Oh!  No. Yeah. Yeah.  If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.  And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.  
 What are we gonna do?! 
 Hey, what are you guys doin'? 
Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks. Yeah, that turkey sucks. But what are we gonna do? 
Six! 
How do they eat? 
Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.   Alright!  My family isn't rich. But I... Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park?  I know. But why? All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich. I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart! I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please.  I'm sure.  That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting. Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think? It doesn't matter, Mom. They're ''poor'' people pants.  I sure did. Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart. Here you go.  It's a DVD of the Lion King I only have this. What's a VHS?  Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood! I'm Tolkien. Aah, he's a lawyer. I think. All right!  ...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.  You do? God, that's great! I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  middle-income. Well, they never really had any money. Well I... think that.. they... ...That's ...great. Hi. Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding. Oh. Alright then.  Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms?   This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight? I don't fit in anywhere. Hello, my name is Tolkien. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  Uuuh, yeah. RRrrr!!  Roar!  You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion! Who's Aslan? Are... you... Aslan?  Well, I'm Tolkien Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else. Well, I don't know. What? ...I like jokes a lot. So can I stay? Huuuunh  Aslan. ...I thnk I'm gonna go home now. They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.  ...No thanks. No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.   Jesus, lions suck! Hey guys. You mean, you ''want'' me around? Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich. That's right, huh? You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich. You're not?  
All right!   Well, what am I supposed to do? Aaaah. Oh, I know.  
I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with. I'm gonna start saying that now. Here comes a sedan.   "If I was Bebe, I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."  Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much. Yeah. What the hell happened to us? 
 I'm not playing anymore.    Five midgets, spanking a man... covered with Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love? 
How do ''you'' know? None of ''us'' had ever had any drugs before. 
When was the last time you had a manicure, straight man?  
What?! We don't ''have'' a bass guitar.  Hey, there ''was'' a bass guitar in my basement. So, what are we doing?  I don't know how to play bass.  I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes! God-damnit!  Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?  This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!   Why the hell would I be looking way over there?? Cartman, what the hell is all this? But you spent all the money we made! Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band. Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience! 
What?! How did that happen? 
 Whoa! Where'd you get those?! And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling! Butters! Butters! 
 Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys? Wow, those animals are pretty cute. Action News! Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive. Huh?  Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute!  That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay. We did that! Cough medicine?  Yeah. It was great. The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Dexa Cough, children's formula. 
Those wings don't look very strong. There has to be another way! 
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not? 
Nothin' Yeah. I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.  ...Yeah? We were at why I should give you ten percent.  ''You'll never find...''As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do... ''Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby''But I'm the one who loves you and there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else. ''... (you're gonna miss my lovin')''I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove. Here you go.  Thanks. Are you serious? Oh my God! Okay! Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me. Send a cress in your plates, folks?   What, what are you doin' here? Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home. 
No! 
Ignoring him? How come? Oh yeah. 
Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you.  Ginger kids eat in the hallway! What are you doing? 
...What do we do? 
Hey Eric, where's Kyle? 
Hey yeah!  Okay.  That's it, I'm dead! 
Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning on the news. Uh, well, actually it ''is'' kind of a big deal, Stan. It may be a mistake, but ''you'' don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal. That's easy for you to say, Stan. That doesn't mean I can just be fine. If you ''really'' think it's not a big deal, then you ''really'' are ignorant. That's all. I'm not ''fighting'' anybody.  Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.  You just don't get it, Stan!  Sooo black people are midgets?  I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it! No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either! Nothing! No! Now you get it, Stan.  Thanks, dude. 
Yeah. Me neither. What the hell?!  
 ... I don't want the code name Blackie. Whoa. 
Go Stan! Yeah, Stan! 
Who do they say is the ugliest? I'm number two? Wow. 
She is pissed off. 
Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so.  Yes. 
You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw! I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you! Oh! Sure, that works. I can't believe it's him. 
Base! Why? 
He's gone! 
Why are you involving me in this?  Will you stop changing channels and just pick something? This is my room! I'll take the remote from you! You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge! That's the alarm; someone's in the backyard. I don't know. A motion detector.  
Nuh-uh! 
 Why?! Why are you happy for me?! Nothing!   No!  No!  AAA! Where is everybody? What's goin' on?? Hey! In here!  Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on.  Oh... Good. It sure was. Yeah. Now that it's over, I... I guess it was kind of fun.  I'd like that.  Hey Nichole. Sure!  What's up? Oh. Okay... I think... you're really great. Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around.  Yeah. Yeah, I guess.  Yeah. Yeah, we're through.  Hi. I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black.  There are still people who will look at us funny. And think we're supposed to be together. I don't care, either.  YAY!  
Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness. Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.  At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything. Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air. He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I.   Come in. I helped you make a documentary, Kyle. Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I? But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  Not by us, or anyone else.  It actually aired last night. Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo. Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't- That's good, Fatty, get pissed! Yeah, Fatty! What the hell is going on? 
Nothing. Yeah. I uhhh, have band practice. Fuck you, Brad Pitt! I'm good. Okay, really? ...What jury?  I don't know what to say. This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme. Can I go back to class now?  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?! He's just out looking for trouble. You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero! So what?! Fuck you! Oh!  An apology?! He shot me!  Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law! And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?! 
If you know of a way, wizard, then speak. 
Wow, she's hot. 
Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags. Come on guys, let's go! 
There's just so many of them. Whattaya mean? Can you really blame them? A what? 
You assholes destroyed the best place in town because they wouldn't kiss your asses! 
We will defend our ninja honor!  Hey guys, did you come to see our ninja fortress? Yeah, with Clyde and David too.  It is a great honor to see that you all want to be ninjas. Joining our club is very serious. You must promise to uphold the warrior's code.  Together we must strive to make our fortress super bad-ass and keep all intruders out! To that end, let us proceed to our training. Wait, he said this was gay? You guys! You guys! Actual Ninjas. Wanna talk to us. Kenny and I both just got the same email from people overseas. All those in favor of Cartman being kicked out of our ninja club? 
He pushed everyone too far. Yeah, I'm really excited. Let's just get it over with! 
You know for what! You know what we did to Cartman!  
That's true! 
Uh, aren't you running for President? 
I'm here, what's this about Kyle? Okay, okay sure.<poem><i>I feel alright, mamma...</i></poem> What!? Beyonce ain't nothin' but a Taylor Swift ripoff. 
Dude, what happened? So what do you want from us? 
But you said she was mentally abusive. 
Fastpass, what makes you feel... qualified to be part of our cinematic universe?  Now, Zuckerberg! Let me see you block my shtoile! 
What are we gonna do, guys? Stan's right. This might fall on us.  
Heidi's getting fat?  What do you want? So? What?! Why?! You still have a house! Get outta here!  Nothing, Mom. ...NO!! I told you not to let him in. 
"...How are my approval ratings?" [walks up with his bike] I saw him too. I saw Stranger Things AND It. 
They're the denominators, so they stay a four. I actually never saw Black Panther. No, I didn't see it.  I didn't make him fail, no! Get out of my house! Come on, get out!  Nnnope. You did all that instead of actually studying for the test? I didn't see Black Panther. Ii didn't see Black Panther in the theater! I sear on my mother's life, I don't care what you said about Black Panther! Goodbye!   Well, we're probably both gonna fail now because fourth period already started.  
Shh! Butters, don't tell them our secret! Oh God, Butters!  
What is your goddamn problem?!  Fuck this!  Can we go now? 
A conscientious objector? 
Here he comes.  
Well, you're kinda havin' fun now, aren't you? 
Ow!  
Yup. 
Oh, hey Stan.  Fine. It's kinda far, isn't it? What are you talking about? My name is "Tolkien".  Stan? You out here? Oh, okay, sorry.  Guys? Can I come in now? W-what are you guys talking about?  Oh, hey, Stan. Stan... Are you ok? You've just been acting kind of strange the last few days. Okay. Wow. Wow... Why would my parents name me something that means the only black person? Well, it's not like I really have a choice. That's why I'm here. My parents just bought the farm across the street. Yeah. Out of the blue my dad was just like, "We're going into the farming business!" And we all just picked up and moved.
