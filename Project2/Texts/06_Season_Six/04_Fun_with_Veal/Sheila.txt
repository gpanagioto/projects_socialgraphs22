Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise ''your'' kids, but ''my'' son does not play negotiator with ''me''! HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  This is ''your'' mother! You will open this door right now!  Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!  AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!  Mmmrragh!! Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours! Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can. Oh dear God, you've ruined everything. You're giving them a missile?? All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.
