Dude, I wonder where Kyle is. Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.  What's Casa Bonita? Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us. Yeah, it's kinda weird. Yeah. Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there.  Really? Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do. I knew he'd turn up. Cartman, stop it!
