If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave! Well your side has the grocery store. Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs!  Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?! Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny! NOW! Eh-ah, I guess we owe ''you'' one. <i>We can be a nation that believes in war.</i>
