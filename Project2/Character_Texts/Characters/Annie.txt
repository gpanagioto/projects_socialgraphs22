Bye, Kenny. 
You don't know? She's super-rich!  Oh yeah, let's get lots of that! Wow, you really sound like a dumb brat, Bebe. Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff! Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is? See? You ''are'' too smart. Oh, yeah. Here comes Kyle.  Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way.  Be at Bebe's house, tonight, at seven!  Ew, party foul! Wow, what a bitch.  
I don't even know what a queef is. Oh. 
So wait, you're keeping all the money now? 
Annie! Oh God. Annie! Annie! Yeah! 
This is an attack on all of us! It's time to make the boys suffer! This has gone on too long and it's time to do something! Don't forget what you said Wendy: "For too long girls here have taken the backseat! Things have to change!". Now they'll have to listen. 
Kick his ass, Nelly! Get out of here, Cartman; nobody's buying it.  You assholes overcooked them!  
We're at Mimi Thompson's party. Peppa Pig just collapsed on stage.  
Why not? Eric Cartman's a horrible person. Yeah, no kidding. We seriously thought you might marry that piece of shit!
