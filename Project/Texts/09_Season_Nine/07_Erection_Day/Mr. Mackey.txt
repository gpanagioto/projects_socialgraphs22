M'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss those questions in class, m'kay? I got a lot o' responses, so let's read some aloud.  then we'll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?! M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics? Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Well why the hell not?! It's what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M'kay, m'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.  N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don't you come up here? Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now.  Huh?  Oh oh oh, right.
