Amazing. What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens? 
 Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.  There ''is'' no escape.  All beddy-byes for the night, are they? We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it! They'll do it!!  Please, Mr. Sanders.  Horace's parents want to take him home. Please, sir, if you give us one more week,... We're in trouble, Rick. Good-bye, Alice. Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore. 
Oh my God! 
Well, there's a lot of smart people saying ManBearPig is real. It is real! No, it's right there! It's right there behind you!   What?! We have to do something!
