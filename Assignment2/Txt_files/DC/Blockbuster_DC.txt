The first Blockbuster was '''Mark Desmond''', a [[chemist]] who desired to increase his physical strength. Experimenting on himself, he succeeded in making himself stronger and taller, but as a side-effect of the process he also became almost mindlessly aggressive.<ref>{{cite book | last =Rovin | first =Jeff | title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File | date =1987 | location =New York | isbn = 0-8160-1356-X | page=34}}</ref> The mentally debilitated Desmond was cared for by his brother Roland, a local criminal, who kept their mother from discovering what Mark had done to himself.<ref name="dc-ency1">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | contribution=Blockbuster I | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=56 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[London]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>

Roland manipulated his brother into committing crimes on his behalf until they came into conflict with [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. Bruce Wayne had once rescued a young Desmond from drowning, and he discovered that he could calm the enraged adult Desmond by removing his cowl and showing his face.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |last2=Kronenberg |first2=Michael |title=The Batcave Companion |date=2009 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1893905788 |page=220}}</ref> Desmond later found himself clashing with Batman on various occasions. He joined the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] briefly for a battle with the [[Justice League]].<ref> ''The Secret Society of Super Villains'' #1-15 (May-June 1976). DC Comics.</ref>

[[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]] enlisted Blockbuster, Penguin, [[Queen Clea]] of Earth-Two, and [[Ibac]] of Earth-S to wreck Atlantis and use a cloud to sink islands. They are thwarted by Superman, [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman of Earth-Two]], Green Arrow, and [[Spy Smasher]] of Earth-S.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #135 (October 1976). DC Comics.</ref>

Later, [[Amanda Waller]] recruited Desmond for her revived [[Suicide Squad]]. He was killed fighting [[Darkseid]]'s creation, [[Brimstone (DC Comics)|Brimstone]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[John Ostrander|Ostrander, John]] | Penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Inker = [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]] | Story = Send For... the Suicide Squad! | Title = [[Legends (comics)|Legends]] | Volume = | Issue = #3 | Date = January 1987 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 14 | Panel = | ID =}}</ref>

In Pre-Crisis, Blockbuster absorbed energies from the Alfred Memorial which gave him some powers and was once substituted for the super-strong [[undead]] villain [[Solomon Grundy (character)|Solomon Grundy]] from Earth-2 due to a machine that was substituting people from both Earths. Green Lantern caused him to fight Solomon Grundy, leading to them both briefly getting the fight knocked out of each other.

In 2011, "[[The New 52]]" rebooted the DC universe. Mark Desmond is a patient of Dr. Phayne's. He lives on the estate and at night he undergoes procedures to enhance his intelligence. He is exposed to small amounts of a green compound intravenously. An accident is caused by a new patient believing he is in pain and the cascade of green liquid overdoses Desmond and creates an explosion. The overdose exposes a super-strong man calling himself Blockbuster. He rampages from the building in pain and knocks an attacking Hawkman unconscious.<ref>''The Savage Hawkman'' #18. DC Comics.</ref> Blockbuster was later mind-controlled by Necromancer to help her steal an artifact from a Washington D.C. museum, which brought the attention of [[Hawk and Dove]]. They teamed up with Batman and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] to stop Blockbuster and Necromancer.<ref>''Hawk and Dove'' (vol. 5) #6. DC Comics.</ref> Mark Desmond later appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains upon having been recruited by [[Outsider (comics)|Outsider]]. When [[Catwoman]] breaks out of Arkham Asylum, Mark Desmond and [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] confronted Catwoman on a rooftop, which ended with Catwoman being knocked out.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 3) #3.

'''Roland Desmond''' became the second Blockbuster after a severe illness forced him to be treated with experimental steroids. Like his brother Mark, Roland became a child-minded super-strong monster. He ran wild in the Southwest, but [[Batman]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] (Will Payton) brought his rampage to an end.<ref>''Starman'' #10 (May 1989). DC Comics.</ref><ref name="dc-ency2">{{Cite book| last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Blockbuster II | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=55 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>

Desmond became obsessed with elevating himself greatly above his debilitated brain. A pact with the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] granted him a full [[intellectual]] mind and Desmond embarked once more on a career of crime and destruction. He began his revived criminal career by causing chaos in the town of Manchester, although his schemes were foiled by the speedster, [[Bart Allen|Impulse]].

Desmond then moved to his mother's hometown of [[Blüdhaven]]. He forced the crime lord Angel Marin out of power and took over the city's criminal rackets. Roland's plan was to build a criminal empire in Blüdhaven that would eventually enable him to extend his dominion over [[Gotham City|Gotham]], [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and [[New York City|New York]]'s underworlds. For that purpose, he bought the corrupt elements of the city's police department, most notably Police Chief Redhorn and Inspector [[Torque (DC Comics)|Dudley "Deadly" Soames]].

Despite his swift and vicious consolidation of power, Blockbuster's hold on Blüdhaven's organized crime was nevertheless weakened by the intervention of the city's new protector, [[Nightwing]] ([[Dick Grayson]], the former [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]), who, with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s help, foiled Desmond's plans at every turn. Oracle often removes money from Blockbuster's accounts and he has a man working to stop and find Oracle, named Vogel.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #44 (June 2000). DC Comics.</ref>

Desmond's primary goal became the elimination of the young vigilante.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=258}}</ref> He placed a contract on Nightwing's life, employing the services of several assassins, including [[Lady Vic]], Stallion, Brutale, the [[Trigger Twins]], and [[Shrike (comics)#Boone|Shrike]].

As a further result of his initial transformation, Desmond later developed [[albinism]] and a heart defect. He was restored to (comparative) health by a heart transplant from one of the talking apes of [[Gorilla City]], and was consolidating his control over Blüdhaven and contemplating a takeover of [[Gotham City]], when he was killed by the new [[Tarantula (DC Comics)#Catalina Flores|Tarantula]], Catalina Flores.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #93 (July 2004). DC Comics.</ref>

As part of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Roland's corpse is reanimated by a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] and recruited to the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1 (October 2009). DC Comics.</ref>

In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called "[[DC Rebirth]]", which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to "The New 52". Blockbuster appears asking Nightwing to help with a job.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 4) #22. DC Comics.</ref>

===Blockbuster III===
[[Lex Luthor]] created a new Blockbuster in the pages of the miniseries event, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', to serve as an opponent of his manufactured hero team, [[Infinity, Inc.]] Little is revealed about this Blockbuster, save for the fact that Luthor possesses some measure of control over his actions and level of strength. Luthor also comments that he is stronger than either of the previous two Blockbusters. This brute's cognitive abilities and appearance are very similar to the original. Blockbuster, with controlled interference from Lex Luthor, kills the superhero [[Trajectory (comics)|Trajectory]].<ref>''52'' #21. DC Comics.</ref>

===Martian Manhunter's disguise===
A Blockbuster appears among the villains exiled to an alien world in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. In issue #3, it is revealed to be a disguised [[Martian Manhunter]].

===Female Blockbuster===
A newer, female Blockbuster appears in the swamps of Louisiana and fights [[Mon-El]].<ref>''Superman'' #689 (August 2009). DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
All Blockbusters have immense strength, stamina, and a high resistance to physical and energy attacks. Once [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]], most of them loses their intellect. In a straight battle, typically the greatest weakness is their comparatively slower speed, making it relatively easy to evade opposing fights, although this is of limited use if confronting Blockbuster inside [[buildings]].<ref>''Detective Comics'' #349 (March 1966)</ref>

After selling his [[soul]] to Neron, Roland Desmond gained supergenius intelligence.<ref>''Underworld Unleashed'' #1 (November 1995)</ref>

==Alternative versions==
===''Batman/Aliens''===
The Roland Desmond version of Blockbuster is mentioned as using a construction company as a [[Trojan horse]]. The owner and multiple workers are killed by an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] they unearth from a bioweapons lab at a construction site.

===DC Animated Universe comics===
The Roland Desmond version of Blockbuster appears in ''[[Adventures in the DC Universe]]'' #1 and ''DC Comics Presents: Wonder Woman Adventures'' #1.

===''Batman: Arkham''===
In ''Batman: Arkham Knight-Genesis'', a prequel comic to ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', the Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster and [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] brutally beat [[Jason Todd]], the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], while dressed in Batman costumes as part of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s brainwashing of Todd. Todd fought back, but was reluctant to kill them. [[Harley Quinn]] encouraged him, shooting Blockbuster in the chest to prove her point.

===''Just Imagine...''===
In [[Stan Lee]]'s ''[[Just Imagine...]]'' series, Blockbuster is reimagined as '''Brock Smith''', a death row inmate notorious for a series of mass murders committed with his bare hands, who is rescued by the series' mysterious villain Dominic Darrk and re-empowered with extra super-strength (and a purple carapace) as part of a villainous [[Doom Patrol]]. He is defeated and de-powered by Batman and Wonder Woman (who crack his purple facade with Wonder Woman's staff), and dies after running over a live electrical cable.<ref>''Just Imagine...'' JLA #1, DC Comics.</ref>
