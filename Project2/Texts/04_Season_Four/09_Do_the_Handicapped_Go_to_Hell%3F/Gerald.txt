Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day. Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you ''don't'' believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?
