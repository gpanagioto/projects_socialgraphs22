He's gonna be here any minute, Ike. Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does. Happy Chanukah, Mom.  Go away!  Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes! Okay, good. You're all here. It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet. It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come. If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!  Dude, you sneezed on my back! Hey, look.  Hello? ...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that- But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit. A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer. Sure we'll help!  Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around! Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!  How hard can it be? Look at it.  Mayor! We have the solution to your problem. We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.  You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!  Ah, Mr. Hankey?  We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card. Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days.  Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got. They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they ''kinda'' look like us. God job, Butters. See ya!  No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later.  What's a hard p? Oh, yeah. <poem><i>We wish-</i></poem>  What? Well, yes, I think so.  Don't you oppress me, fat boy. Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass! Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame. Yeah. So what's the first syllable? Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame. That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot!  Now, the next mouth. Okay, where are the E-mouths? Okay. "Woo" mouths again? So how much done is that?  Jesus Christ! Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames.  Cartman!  Fine! We'll do it with out you! We'll dub his voice over. <poem><i>You love-</i></poem> <poem><i>-And I'll labor. </i></poem> <poem><i>You sit- </i></poem> <poem><i>-And I'll stand. </i></poem> You can do Cartman's voice, can't you? Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter. ''Cool!'' Now let's try the script! Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy. <poem><i>You wish-</i></poem> <poem><i>-And I'll whittle.</i></poem> <poem><i>You sit- </i></poem> <poem><i>-And I'll stand. </i></poem> <poem><i></i></poem> Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit! Okay, Mr. Hankey! What? Yeah, I think so.  What? <poem><i>Dreidel dreidel dreidel-</i></poem> All that hard work. But we spent it! All that work! Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey. What the-- They did it! They got it working!  ...We actually spokeâ€”to '''''the''''' Brian Boitano. Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted. What?  Ah. Yeah. You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!  Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
