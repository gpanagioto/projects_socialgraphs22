Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude.  There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!  What the hell are they doing? Dude, girls are such fags.  This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys.  Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends. Ehhhhhhh.  I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on. ...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore.  You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class. Fuck you, Kyle!  Oh God, shut up! Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup! Oh that's good, that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice. No way dude. Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes." "Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."  "That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes." I told you guys. He's been watching ''High School Musical'' over and over again. You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson. That's a low blow, Stan.  <poem><i>But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.</i></poem> <poem><i>Don't stress about it or you just might faint.</i></poem>
