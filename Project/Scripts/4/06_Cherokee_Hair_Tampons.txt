South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's classroom. But this day, a substitute teacher enters with a bag of stuff and makes an announcement.

Mr. Wyland

Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland. [writes it on the chalkboard. A shot of the class reveals Kyle missing]

Cartman

[in a low voice] Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.

Mr. Wyland

Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers. [Cartman points at Craig] But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm. [runs his finger down the list] Eric Cartman?

Stan

[raises his hand] Here! [he, Kenny, and Cartman laugh heartily]

Mr. Wyland

Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?

Kenny

[raises his hand] (Here.) [he, Stan, and Cartman laugh heartily]

Wendy

It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus.

Mr. Wyland

Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick?

Cartman

[raises his hand] Here. [he, Stan, and Kenny laugh heartily. A few seconds later his nose bleeds a white liquid all over his desk] Oh, hoho. Ow.

Stan

Dude, what the hell was that?

Cartman

Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!

Stan

 ...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.

Cartman

Huh?

Stan

You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.

Cartman

Not with me, man.

Mr. Wyland

Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today. [reaches into the bag and pulls out some glue and glitter] I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski?

Stan

[drawn out] He's fakin'!

Mr. Wyland

Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it.

The Class

Awww. [the kids leave their seats and head for the front of the class. Cartman remains in his seat]

Cartman

[drawn out] He's fakin'! [the other kids get busy decorating the card]

Mr. Wyland

Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.

Cartman

But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.

Mr. Wyland

I don't care! Get down here and do it!

Butters

Hey, watch it! [Mr. Wyland looks down at the group] Hey, what are you doin'? [the kids back away to reveal Butters decorated, not the poster board. A sign hangs on him saying "Get Well Kyle"]

Stan

Now, that's a get-well card! [the others laugh. Cartman soon joins them, but his nose begins to leak that white liquid again. He covers his nostrils and continues laughing]

Denver, day. The Denver School Administration building is shown. Inside, the South Park School Board is meeting. Principal Victoria is present among the three people seated around a horseshoe-shaped table.

Chairman

Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.

Mr. Garrison

What??

Board Member

Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting. [a look of disbelief comes across Mr. Garrison's face]

Chairman

Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?

Mr. Garrison

Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!

Chairman

...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about. [reviews a sheet of paper] It's your somewhat substantial police record.

Mr. Garrison

[stomps his foot down] Oh, whatever!

Principal Victoria

Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-

Mr. Garrison

That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! [points to his puppet]

Board Member

All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little [does quotes with two fingers on each hand] "child molestation" thing dies down a bit.

Mr. Garrison

[rises from his chair] Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.

Chairman

We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice.

Mr. Garrison

[crestfallen] Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore. [approaches the chairman] I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... [pulls them out and sets them on the table]

Chairman

Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!

Mr. Garrison

Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then? [grabs back his revolver]

Kyle's house, day, Kyle's room. He's in bed delirious and mumbling. His door opens and in walks Sheila with Sharon and Stan.

Sheila

Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.

Sharon

Hello, sweetie. [Stan walks over to Kyle's bed]

Stan

Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. [Kyle mumbles once more] Kyle?

Sheila

They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.

Sharon

Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. [Butters walks into the room still decorated from head to toe in glitter and glue, and he carries the sign in his right hand]

Stan

Go on, Butters!

Butters

Ho, I don't wanna!

Stan

Butters, go on!

Butters

Oh, uhuh alright, then. [starts to sing]

We're so sorry you're not feeling well
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
[brings out a cane and dances]
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
[pulls a rip cord and a bunch of balloons inflate automatically around him. Kyle babbles some more]



Stan

Dude, you really are sick, huh?

Kyle

I don't know, I...

Sheila

I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.

Sharon

Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.

Sheila

Really? In People?

Sharon

There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."

Sheila

Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.

Sharon

Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.

Sheila

Okay. I'll get our coats. [turns and walks out the door. Kyle babbles some more]

Butters

Can I go now?

-----


South Park Elementary, Mr. Mackey's office. Craig waits outside on a bench.

Mr. Garrison

[lying down on a couch] I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.

Mr. Mackey

[in a armchair] Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do.

Mr. Garrison

I've always wanted to write a novel.

Mr. Mackey

Well, there you go, m'kay?

Mr. Garrison

But I never know what to write about.

Mr. Mackey

Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?

Mr. Garrison

Besides teaching?

Mr. Mackey

Yes.

Mr. Garrison

...Poontang.

Mr. Mackey

M, m'kay

Mr. Garrison

I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.

Mr. Mackey

Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.

Mr. Garrison

Yes, that's it. [sits up brightly] I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!

Miss Information's New Age Shop. The sign is framed by two antlers and its entrance is a curtain of beads. In the picture window you see a pyramid with an eye on one side, a crystal ball and stand, a little elephant, and some charms. Outside, under the window, is a bed of flowers. Inside, Miss Information talks to Stan, Kyle, and their moms. Kyle looks fatigued

Miss Information

You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.

Sheila

Toxins?

Miss Information

All the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.

Sharon

Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!

Sheila

You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. [Kyle coughs]

Stan

Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?

Miss Information

What?

Stan

Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?

Sharon

Don't be a smartass, Stanley.

Miss Information

Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.

Sharon

Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. [Kyle begins to babble]

Mr. Garrison's house, night. A second-story window casts a shadow of Mr. Garrison at his laptop computer. He types and we hear the words as he says them in his mind...

Mr. Garrison


Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good [sips some wine]
Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard.
[taps his chin with his left index finger. The computer screen is shown as the words are typed]
His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his
[pauses]
penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples
[music cuts off. He thinks] Uh, let's see... [taps his chin with his right index finger] Diana's nipples...[The words on the screen are shown halted at 'nipples'] [aloud] Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck. [turns his body to one side] Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.


-----


Kyle's house, morning. At Kyle's bedside, Sharon, Sheila, and Liane talk to each other while Stan keeps vigil. Three other mothers are there

Mrs. Tweak

Oh my, he looks terrible.

Blonde Mother

Yes, poor little dear.

Miss Information

[arrives] Good morning, everyone.

Blonde Mother

[walks up to her and brings her in] Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse. [Miss Information walks to Kyle's bed as Stan watches. She raises her arms and waves them over Kyle's body]

Miss Information

Huuuuuuuuuh [lowers her arms] Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better.

Sheila

Really?

Stan

What?

Miss Information

Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter.

Sharon

Oh, that's great news! [Kyle barfs and Stan steps out of the way]

Sheila

Oh no!

Miss Information

Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system.

Sharon

Ooooo.

Stan

Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.

Sharon

Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!

Stan

Don't be a smartass?

Miss Information

Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!

Sheila

Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.

Other mothers

[ad lib] I agree. Yeah. That's right. [Stan looks defeated]

-----


Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Doctor is in his office filling out a form

Nurse

[over an intercom] Mr. Marsh is here to see you.

Dr. Doctor

Alright, send him in. [from his desk, golf balls, a cup, and a set of golf clubs can be seen. Stan enters] Oh, Stanley.

Stan

Hi, doctor. [takes a seat]

Dr. Doctor

How can I help you?

Stan

Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.

Dr. Doctor

He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.

Stan

But I don't think it's working.

Dr. Doctor

Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.

Stan

[overwhelmed] Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.

Dr. Doctor

I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn.

Stan

...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.

Dr. Doctor

That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact, [looks at a sheet of paper] there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle.

Stan

Who? [Dr. Doctor turns the sheet around, and Cartman's picture is on it. A close-up reveals that Cartman has AB-negative blood] Oh, shit.

-----


Cartman's house, day. Cartman and Kenny are playing at dogfights in the air, and Kenny makes sound effects while maneuvering a yellow ship

Kenny

(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.) [crashes the ship into a soldier]

Cartman

"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew [grabs for the yellow ship] Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.

Kenny

(No, no.)

Cartman

Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser [pulls the cruiser his way] so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.

Kenny

[gets up as Cartman speaks] (Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!) [pulls the cruiser back] (There! It's mine!) [the doorbell rings and the two boys tug at the ship in opposite directions]

Cartman

No, mine. M'yah! [the ship breaks in two, with Kenny getting the short end] Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha [his nose spurts out white fluid again] bluh oh, ha-ow! [blocks his nostrils]

Liane

[walks up] Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?

Cartman

Yeah.

Liane

Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. [Stan enters with a sick Kyle in his arms]

Cartman

Okay, mom.

Liane

[genuflects and speaks softly to Cartman] And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. [Stan leaves Kyle and walks up to Cartman]

Cartman

What's goin' on, guys?

Stan

Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.

Cartman

Oh-kay.

Stan

Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.

Cartman

Uh huh.

Stan

What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.

Cartman

Oh, I think I see where this is going. [Kyle moans]

Stan

His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but it's obviously not working.

Cartman

Stan, why don't you just ask the question?

Stan

Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?

Cartman


[sings and dances]
No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!



Stan

But you only need one, fat boy!

Cartman


'No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!



Stan

Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!

Kenny

[miffed] (It's not that's fucking serious.) [Kyle coughs twice]

Cartman

Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.

Stan

Oh my God!

Kyle

How much?

Cartman

I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?

Stan

Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!

Cartman

Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.

Kenny

(Ten million dollars??)

Stan

What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!

Cartman

What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

Stan

Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. [they walk away]

Cartman

Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. [they return to the floor to continue play] "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!

-----


Miss Information's shop, next day. A line of folks wait to enter the shop while a few shoppers exit with their purchases. Inside, the shop is busy.

Man 1

Oooh, free-range aspirin!

Man 2

All-natural cell phones! [Two stoners, who appear to be Richard 'Cheech' Marin and Tommy Chong, appear at the door with boxes of stuff]

Miss Information

Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez. [shoppers gather around the men]

Man 3

[amid the chatter] Ooo.

Man 4

I'd like to buy some more stuff.

Man 5

Come in. Come here, guys.

Man 6

Do you have any new holistic items for sale?

Carlos Ramirez

Oohh, oh yeah. Aah... [holds up a decorated clothes hanger] Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher.

Woman 1

Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one. [other women start ordering them]

Chief Running Pinto

[holds up an item] Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people.

Sharon

Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural.

Miss Information

Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.

Chief Running Pinto

Oh yeah. We love the earth, man.

Carlos Ramirez

Oh yeah, the earth is great.

Miss Information

[walks up to Sheila] Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.

Chief Running Pinto

Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'.

Carlos Ramirez

[laughs] uh'hm, ho ho hm.

Sheila

Wonderful!

Miss Information

[takes Sheila along] Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit. [the other shoppers crowd the two men]

Man 7

D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff.

Man 8

Yes. Much, much more stuff.

Chief Running Pinto

Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk. [Ramirez starts to laugh] Come on. [turns to leave]

Miss Information

Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you.

Carlos Ramirez

Oh yah. You too and junk. [they head out the door and away]

Chief Running Pinto

[off-screen] That's funny, man. [Stan walks in]

Sharon

Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.

Stan

You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?

Sharon

That's right.

Stan

Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.

Miss Information

Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE. [to Sheila] Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars. [Sheila pays, and Miss Information rings it up]

Sheila

Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.

Stan

Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?

Sharon

You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!

Stan

And that has something to do with their medicines because...?

Sharon

Enough, Stanley!

-----


Miss Information's shop, curbside. Kenny is sitting there. Stan exits the store, walks over to him, and sits down next to him. Somber music plays

Stan

Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.

Kenny

(I know.)

Stan

I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.

Kenny

(Uh huh.)

Stan

I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do. [Kenny gets mad, Stan gets resolute] Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! [walks away]

Kenny

(Rrrh!)

Mr. Garrison's house, night. He's back at his laptop. He's typing with only his left hand now, while Mr. Hat sits on his right hand

Mr. Garrison

[We hear Mr Garrison's thoughts]
Chapter 18.
Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about.
[out loud]Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!
And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused. [Words on the computer screen are seen typed] "Go on", Rebecca said softly, "Touch me." Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises.
[unconsciously, his right hand (Mr Hat hand) lowers down towards his crotch and is soon out of view, but the arm moves around some...]
They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with...
[catches himself masturbating] Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?! [looks around to see that no one is watching, then happily] Oh, Mr. Hat!


-----


Bus stop, night. Stan waits with a book under his arm.

Stan

[checks his watch] Come on, where are they? [looks around. Three boys approach from his left: Kenny, Butters, and Timmy]

Stan

This is it??

Kenny

(Uh huh)

Timmy

Timmiiihh!

Stan

This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??

Butters

Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.

Stan

[quite disappointed] Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!

Butters

Huh, where are we goin'?

Stan

We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. [the others look are shocked]

Switch to live action. Daytime in a middle class American backyard. A dyed sandy haired, middle-aged, white woman speaks with her sandy haired daughter while seated on the patio lounge.

Mother

[Smiling, empty-headed into the distance]

Daughter

[hesitantly] Mom... Do you ever have those heavy flow days?

Mother

[Places her hand comfortingly on her daughter's thigh] Oh absolutely sweetheart, everybody does.

Daughter

[Camera zooms in on her face] Mom, remember the movie The Shining where the elevator doors are opening up..

Mother

[Camera switches to close-up on mother's face] Oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon. [grabs her daughter's hand and shakes hands in emphasis]

Daughter

[Camera zooms back out] Like what?

Mother

Well, what's the most absorbent thing in the world?

Daughter

[Looks down, plays with her hair and mulls it over] Well... Cherokee hair I guess. [Camera zooms back on her face] But what does that have to do with me?

Mother

[Camera zooms out and mother grabs a box]
Because now there is all new, natural 
[Camera zooms in on mother who fakes a broad smile and holds a purple box of 'All Natural Cherokee Hair Tampons' with a Native woman that looks like the Land O' Lakes butter symbol]
Cherokee hair tampons. 
[Broadens her fake smile].


-----


Live action continues. Petri dish, on a table, with tampon is shown in front of tampon box while a light brown hand pours dyed blue water over the tampon. The tampon swells quickly.

Female announcer

[Speaking like an authority]
A cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid. 
[Scene slides over to another petri dish with tampon in front of box where the hand pours blue liquid on that tampon that swells more slowly] 
Other tampons also come up short. 
[Scene slides right again to a Cherokee woman laying on the table with her hair spread flat along the table]
But Cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful 
[The hand pours dyed blue water along the Cherokee woman's splayed hair, which doesn't absorb any of it, while the woman looks up at her hair]
Each tampon is hand woven 
[A white woman's manicured hand holds up a hair 'tampon' bundle up with cross-hatched orange yarn, bead wrapped center and a white pull string for extraction] 
from over 200 strands of Cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads.


-----


Live action continues. Front yard of suburban home. Daughter runs up to mother who is trimming the roses.

Daughter

You were right mom! All natural Cherokee hair tampons really did the trick. [Mother smiles back fakely and continues working]

Mother

And when you're done using them [She holds up Cherokee tampon] they make a great toy for Jessie. [Mother and daughter smile broad, fake smiles] Go get it boy! [Mother tosses Cherokee tampon off camera]

Jessie

[Tampon flies into the grass where Jessie, the white terrier grabs it and shakes it] Grrr... grrrr

Chief Running Pinto (Tommy Chong in his stoner voice)

[Camera shows mother and daughter smiling huge, fake smiles with their arms about each other peering into each other's face with the text 'Cherokee Hair Tampons' on the screen below. Mother mouths 'I love you'] Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons.

Cartman's house, night. Cartman is asleep in his bed... tossing and turning

Cartman

No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!

-----


Cartman's house, outside. Stan and the others approach, and Stan looks in the lower window. Stan now has a hand saw on his right hand

Stan

[softly] Okay, it's clear. [slowly opens the front door] Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.

Timmy

Timmiihh!

Stan

Sshhh!

Timmy

[whispering] Timmiihh.

Stan

If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?

Kenny

(Okay)

Timmy

[softly] Timmiihh.

Stan

Alright Butters, let's go. [they walk away and up the stairs, then down the hall, but Stan stops in his tracks] Uh-oh, Cartman's pig. [Fluffy is seen sleeping in her own little bed. Stan and Butters try to sneak past, but she opens her eyes] Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay. [Butters accidentally steps on Fluffy's tail and she squeals in panic. This wakes Cartman, who blinks and heads for his door half-asleep] Come on, we gotta get outta here! [runs a bit, then has his back to the wall as Cartman opens the door and walks out] Oh, no!

Butters

Oh well, we're busted. [Cartman continues towards Fluffy, Ignoring the boys]

Cartman

[smacks her] Shut up, Fluffy! [she quiets down and Cartman goes back to sleep, closing his door.]

Stan

Oh, phew.

-----


Cartman's house, later. Cartman's nightmare returns

Cartman

Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! [Stan rises from the other side of the bed with the medical book, and Butters rises, too]

Stan

Okay, here we go. [opens the book and leafs through. Pictures of the heart, fingers, liver, and cutaway of the male genitalia are shown. Stan giggles softly and turns the page to a picture of the kidney] Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...

Butters

I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.

Stan

...vein right, well- [brings out the saw] Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. [Butters pulls the sheets, Stan the shirt, and something more is in their way] No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!

Cartman

[rises quickly] whatwhatwhatwhat? [sees Stan and Butters] Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!

Stan

You suck, Cartman!

Cartman

[faces them] Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!

Stan

God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!

Cartman

I do! I do care! Look how much. [a blank expression is on his face] Look. Look how much I care. [the expressionless face persists]

Harequin Romance Book Publishing CO. Mr. Garrison has finished his novel and is now inside talking to a publisher

Publisher

First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance.

Mr. Garrison

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, did you read the book?

Publisher

Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book. [taps on it a few times]

Mr. Garrison

Well, what did you think?

Publisher

Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you.

Mr. Garrison

Ooohhh, why not?

Publisher

Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word "penis" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?

Mr. Garrison

Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel.

Publisher

Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a "romance novel."

Mr. Garrison

No?

Publisher

[clears his throat] No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay.

Mr. Garrison

What the hell are you talkin' about?!

Publisher

It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.

Mr. Garrison

Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!

Publisher

It is.

Mr. Garrison

Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs! [the publisher has no answer] Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!

Publisher

[taps his chin] Hmmm.

South Park, next day. Stan and Kenny sit on the curb in front of "South Park Pianos"

Stan

[despondent, voice cracking] There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!

Kenny

(You never seem to care when I die!)

Stan

[sobs] My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it. [begins to break down] Oh, God, he's my best friend... [weeps]

Kenny

[stands up] (Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) [walks away. Above him, a man is hauling a piano, but realizes the ropes are tearing]

Mover

Look out! [the piano snaps from the ropes and crushes Kenny] Oops.

Stan

Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! [weeps]

-----


South Park, Miss Information's shop, day. More people line up to buy holistic stuff. Inside, Carlos Ramirez and Chief Running Pinto field orders.

Mrs.Tucker

Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please.

Chief Running Pinto

[hands them to her] No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front. [she walks away with the tampons and Carlos glances at her ass]

Man 7

Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1.

Carlos Ramirez

Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice. [the man takes it and drinks. Carlos and Chief Pinto chortle]

Man 7

Wow, I feel better already! [walks away. Carlos and Chief Pinto laugh some more.]

Miss Information

[joining the two men] And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son. [Sheila drags Kyle in by his jacket collar]

Sheila

[let's him drop to the floor] Okay, here he is.

Chief Running Pinto

Ahahem, that kid looks really sick.

Miss Information

Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.

Chief Running Pinto

No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor.

Customers

[look at each other] Hmm?

Sheila

But you're more in touch with the earth.

Chief Running Pinto

Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man.

Sharon

It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. [Carlos and Chief Pinto look at each other. Kyle groans]

Carlos Ramirez

No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican.

Customers

What?!

Man

Hu-uh?!

Carlos Ramirez

Yeah. A Mexican.

Man 7

Uugh. [spits out the ball juice] Ptu, ptu.

Man 8

I didn't know that.

Gerald

Oh my God! [Mrs.Tucker, who had purchased the 48 tampons screams in horror and covers her crotch area]

Sharon

How dare you deceive us like that!

Chief Running Pinto

Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that.

Carlos Ramirez

Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans. [the customers blink in anger, then gather around Miss Information]

Miss Information

Uh, toxins are your enemy. [the customers enclose her]

Woman 1

Kill her! [the pummeling begins. Carlos and Chief Pinto just laugh at the sight]

Carlos Ramirez

Funny.

-----


South Park, Miss Information's shop, later. Stan, Sheila, and Kyle are still there

Stan

So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?

Sheila

Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!

Stan

That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.

-----


Cartman's house, morning. A cock crows, and Cartman's radio sounds the alarm. Cartman rises on his bed and stretches

Cartman

Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA! [jumps back. His Kidney Blocker 2000 lies at the foot of his bed over streaks of blood] That son of a bitch!

-----


Stan's house, moments later. Cartman approaches and pounds on the door. Stan quickly opens it.

Cartman

[fuming] Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!

Stan

Dude, please. Kyle needs it.

Cartman

It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!

Stan

Alright, alright, here. [hands him a bloody kidney. Cartman reviews it.]

Cartman

Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.

-----


Hell's Pass Hospital, sometime later. Dr. Doctor is in his office.

Nurse

[over an intercom] Doctor, Eric Cartman is here- [Cartman enters unbid before she finishes speaking]

Dr. Doctor

Why, hello there, Eric. [Cartman stands on the chair and slaps the kidney down on the desk. The doctor looks on]

Cartman

You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in! [sits] Please.

Dr. Doctor

Oh, I see. [holds the kidney up] Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?

Cartman

No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!

Dr. Doctor

Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery. [puts the kidney down and holds up a clipboard] If you'll just sign this release. [sets it in front of Cartman]

Cartman

Thank you. [signs the release form]

-----


Hell's Pass Hospital, still later. Cartman and Kyle are in the recovery room surrounded by their parents. Stan and his parents are there, too. Balloons, a smiley-face and two banners, "I HOPE YOU GET BETTER!" and "GET WELL SOON", decorate Kyle's side of the room

Sheila

How are you feeling, boubbie?

Kyle

Better, thanks.

Stan

You look a lot better.

Sharon

Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.

Kyle

Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.

Stan

Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.

Chief Running Pinto

Yeah. [to Cartman] Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too.

Cartman

[wakes up] Heh. Hey, what what's going on?

Stan

Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!

Cartman

Huh?

Stan

It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.

Dr. Doctor

Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release.

Liane

Isn't that funny, sweetie?

Cartman

Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!

Mr. Garrison

[enters the room and walks to Kyle's bed] Oh, here's everybody. [in his hand is a book]

Stan

Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?

Mr. Garrison

Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. [hands the book to Kyle, who looks at it]

Kyle

Oh. ...Thanks?

Cartman

[livid] I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!

Stan

Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. [laughs a long time with Kyle]

Kyle

[white liquid spurts out his nose] Huh? [covers his nose] What the?

Cartman

Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
