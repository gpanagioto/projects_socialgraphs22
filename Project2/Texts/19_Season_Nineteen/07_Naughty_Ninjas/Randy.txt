Really? I'll bet you don't even know what "farm to table" means.   Ew.  No I don't I'm sorry thank you Goddammit ew.  Mayor, I didn't bust my ass to gentrify this part of town to have it overrun with homeless people! What? Okay, we've just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didn't mean it, okay? Alright, look. There's homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district. If you don't stop thewe twisted kids, then-  Officer Barbrady. Hey buddy.  We need you to shoot some kids.  Shh! Shhh! Shhhh! These are really bad kids. Terrorists. This is totally different from before. You're the only cop this town needs, Barbrady. Go shoot those kids. Okay, okay Dad, it's not organic chicken. I'm not comfortable shopping at Whole Foods with all the homeless people there. But don't worry. That's all about to change. Soon we'll all have CtPaTown to enjoy again. Where's Stan? Ninjas? That's gay.  He's playing ninjas at Kenny's house? You mean, SoDoSoPa?  ...scary... gay... Scary. Gay. Scary gay scary gay. Scary gay scary gay scary GAY.   Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now. I said kill some kids, but I said it as a question, remember? I said "Kill some kids?" Thank you, officers.
