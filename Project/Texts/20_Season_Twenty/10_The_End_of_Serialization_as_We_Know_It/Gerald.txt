Dildo? Yes! Yes, where are you? How long before the website goes online? Oh God! ''My'' account?  That's my boy!  Ah! God damn it!  Yeah, I'm here.  I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room.  Yeah...?  Yeah, I'm up with all the servers. [notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever] I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway. Heading to it now! Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong! It's completely heartless and malicious! No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical. Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny? No, but see, that's just nihilism. That is! You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other. I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true.  All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people.  I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have.  I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself.  With only one minor difference. Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!
