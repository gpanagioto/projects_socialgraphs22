 Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.   Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips! Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uhm sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole, Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are! Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?! They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park! This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP! Mom, drive faster! Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG! WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit! Fuck you! No! No, what's going on?!  No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too! You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?! Nooooooooo-!    Really? Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?! Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!  Oh God, oh God it's so good. Yeah. Who isn't? Billy Miller? Seriously?? Tommy said you have some KFC. Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Where did you get that?! 85 bucks?? I don't have that!  How much KFC are we talking? Holy fuck, dude. Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime? Are you Teabag? Cut the crap. You got the stuff? Extra crispy?  You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy! IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT!  You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!  Like anybody wants KFC without gravy! Nothin', it's cool. Yeah I got the stuff.  Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here.  Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel? Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles? I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want. Who? You mean Tommy?  Wait, where'd he go? Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked. Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you! Good.  Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!  Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand! ...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer. I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test. Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys? Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good. Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker! What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker. Colonel, how are you doing?  We had a little problem.  Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that? Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time. Hey, take it easy Colonel.
