Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  No, uh, it's lemon juice. No, it just really, really, really hurts!  Where are your parents?!  ...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out. Get off me!  What the hell is gong on here?! Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant! The mayor! Good! Finally! No parents in the entire town? What happened to them? No phones, either? How do you communicate? Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright?  I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car! Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!  Well, I ''told'' you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children! Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  it makes no sense. It's a boy.  They... killed him. Oh no!    Why are you doing this? Who? Look, ''I'' have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore. I'll do anything to get to a phone! Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is? No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone. I know, but this will all be over soon. Alright, I got the book for you.  Now, can I please have the cell phone? Give him the book back. Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble!  Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight! What?  Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents! The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.  Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left?? Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we ''should'' have some. Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.  Well, what are you kids gonna do now?
