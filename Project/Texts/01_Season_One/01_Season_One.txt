''School days, school days, teacher's golden ru...'' Chef! Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again. Eat banana. Ike, you can't come to school with me.  Dude, don't call my brother a dildo! Well, I don't know... and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either! Well, what? Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby! Kick the baby. Really? What about? Totally! Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows. Yeah, fat boy saw it! What's an anal probe? Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman? We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass. Why you walkin' so funny Cartman? No, Ike, go home. This is it. This one's for the game. Kick the baby! Damn it, he's still there. No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.  Oh, my God! Ike!  STOP THE BUUUUUS! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus! But I have to get off! No. But I... Arrghh! We have to do something! What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.   Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"  "You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?" Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now. No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.  Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class? I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you! Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class? Damn it! Damn, Cartman! Dude, he's farting fire! Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger. Dude, what does the note say? Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her. Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back. Bad. Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you? No! Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up. That was cool! Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me. Okay, so how do we get my little brother back? He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors! Hey! If you Visitors can hear me- -bring me back my little brother, God damnit! Give me back my brother! You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack! Damn it, we were so close! Now do you believe us, Cartman? Cartman, they killed Kenny! He's dead, Cartman! Go on and go home, you fat chicken! You're all I have left, Stan. You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! Rats. Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now. You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do. Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother? Just make sweet love down by the fire. ...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed. Why? Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman.  Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop. How come the Visitors aren't coming for him? Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come! Sure you do! Fart, damn you! Whoa, look at that. Uh, uh... Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing. Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again. Did it work? Hey, you scrawny-eyed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child! You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump! Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on! Ike! Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career! Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike. Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner.  Yeah, we're running out of friends. Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school. Cartman, you do have pinkeye! Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning? Nobody hates rainbows. Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm. No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass? Wow, what did you write about Cartman? What was your paper about Wendy? Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?! Wow, are you gonna do it? What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground? Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. Bulk up to what, fat-ass? Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load. You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever! Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!" I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman. Stop who? Uh oh, we're losing him.  Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards! Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway. Ready to go hunting, Cartman?  Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman. I like chocolate milk. Wow, that'd be cool. What do you mean? I guess so. What?! Shoot it Stan. Hey, what's that? You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants! No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee. Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody! Deformed how? A knife. Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary! Yeah, give me that flashlight. What is that? Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. Stan, Stan, wake up! I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away. They're out fishing with Kenny. Well Stan, you want to know what I think? Look! Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.  Look, up there.  Come on Stan, kill it. Whoa! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Oh my God! Look at his leg! Aaaaah! Hey look, Kenny's okay. Yeah, make up your mind, dude! Dude, I don't understand hunting at all. Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice.  Who's that? Wow! Cool! You're on, dude! I think the other dog's the one that's confused. Who's Middle Park? Hey Stan, isn't that your dog? You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys. Did it work? Ooh-la-la. Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad. Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else. What'd he say? Come on dude, we have to get to practice. Uh, Chef? Chef. Chef! What's the matter dude? Wow, it's been like two days. We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan. You what?! But I never practiced quarterback. Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?! Set, set. Damn it Cartman! Cartman farted! No way dude! Ah, dude, weak. Hike! Hut, hut.  Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards! Hike! Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think! Oof. Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan. You mean this one? He's my new pet elephant. I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three. No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch. Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid. Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya. Mr. Garrison? With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller? That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants. They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs. Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want. I'll bet you can't. Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet! We can use Cartman's pig. We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood. Ready to go Stan? To the Genetical Engineering Ranch. We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's. Why's your sister so mean to you dude? This must be it. No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together. It's just a stupid pig. What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'! There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard! Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig. No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets. How does that make the world better? Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant? Which song is that? Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for? Watch out Stan! Genetic engineers are crazy. No! We're already halfway done. It's more than you've got! Oh my God! They cloned a foot. Hey Chef. We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice. I told you guys. You hear that dudes? We'll be rich! We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk. Yeah Stan, she's just a girl. Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly. The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you." Try it. We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig. Come on Kenny. Come on elephant, keep drinking. Dammit! This is never gonna work. Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex. Hey look! It's working. Aah! Aren't they ever gonna wake up? I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing. Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant? Couple of days? But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow. Is he bigger than a regular clone? How big do you think he is? Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go? Come on, let's go! Wait, Stan, there he goes. He recognizes you dude. What should we do with him? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards! Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not. See ya.  Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now. Does it look like a pig, or an elephant? Dude, it's ''Terrance & Phillip''. But everybody watches ''Terrance & Phillip''. Ow! What the hell was that for?! Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own. Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna. Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all. But won't your grandpa be there? Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help? I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance. Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it? Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman! Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. What are they doing in there? Yep, all done. Yeah, stupid! Well, it, it looks like... Why is Death coming after us? What are we gonna do? Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids. Totally dude. Quick, jump through the window. Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you! Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!! Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment? Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies? You bastards! It looks like a UFO. Dude, it can't be cooler than mine. Ha ha, you look like a pansy. What uh, what are you supposed to be? Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude? No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume. Wow! Cool! Cartman! What kind of costume is that? No it's not cool! Hehe. Sissy. You forgot to wear a costume Kenny. Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny? Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... Everyone came as Chewbacca?! Dammit! Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass! Wookies don't live on Endor! Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine! I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else! I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy. Aren't you hungry Kenny?  Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal. Check this out! I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine! Dude, I thought she was dead. What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! Hey dudes. Check. What's that? You still didn't get a costume Kenny? Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains. If everyone is turned into zombies... Chef, you've gotta help us! Yeah, I'm scared. I found it! I found it! See Cartman, your mom is on the cover. Chef!!! But the zombies are coming! There's a bunch of zombies here! Uh, okay. Then what? Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?! Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary. Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard! It's working! They're turning back to normal. Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us. ...No, dude, that's Christmas. Costumes and candy. We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom. Yeah! Oh, cool. Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on ''Full House''. Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman. Did they say if it's waterproof? What did she say? Ass-rammer. Ask her if we get the watch right away. I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch. Hey, look you guys. The digital sports watch is here. Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians. Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid. Whoa! That was cool. What's your name dude? Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin. Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother. Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me. Totally. We do! This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. Yeah, that one. Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude. But I thought we were ''supposed'' to care on Thanksgiving. Because why? Then ''you'' take care of him. You better watch what you say Cartman! ''You'' might be poor and hungry some day. Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys! I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? Here you go turkeys! You bastards! Yeah, I like him a ''lot'' more than Cartman. Yeah. And that means that McGyver is a real person too. Come on, Mary! Push! I can see its head! It's a boy! ...Sorry. Shut up, fat boy! I can sing the Mr. Hankey song... ''Mr.'' Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it? We can, too! Officer Barbrady! Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow? Damnit! No. But I get Hanukkah presents for eight days. Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet. Well! You're gonna be sorry when you see ''me'' riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass! What's going on, you guys? Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman! Hey! How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo? Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet. Wait... But dad, he always sh... There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey. There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.  Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway. I said Ike's on fire! It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast! I'm not hearing that. Mr. Hankey?  Go away, Mr. Hankey. I said go away! My father said you aren't real. Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble. Nothing. Mr. Hankey, come here. Say something, Mr. Hankey! Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go? Nobody believes in you, not even my friends. Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends. Yeah! We'll show them! Hello, everybodyyy. It's a surprise. O-Okay. But don't scare him... Wait! You guys! He's alive! Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!! Shut up, Cartman! I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman! Shut up, Cartman!  Mr. Hankey. Mr. Hankey, no! Uuuuuuhh... I ''don't have'' a problem. What's that? ''Moo''kie-stinks? Wull, not on purpose. Well, sometimes... Well sure. No, dude! But Mr. Hankey seemed so real... Here. Just look more closely at it. I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac. No. Oh no, I'm not sane yet! Friends? You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy? Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. What is this, Cartman? Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ''ever''. Damn, what a freak! Yeah. Mine says '<i>Red</i> Mega Man'. Yeah, that's weak! You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus. Bad. Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak. The ''new'' kid. We told you, dude. Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny. Yeah. ... K. Ohh, dude! We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil! Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal? Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on. See ya. We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party. Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you? Yeah, you ''have'' to hit him. Hey, you just got here, Chef! And neither were you, Pip! Wow! Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien. It's a game, dude. It's really fun.  Aaaaa! They were all out of 'em dude!  Aaaaaaaa! ''Some''body bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that ''one'' person still had money on you. Uuuuh. Stan? Stan. Stan! Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second. Yeah, dude! Wow. Did he say that in the Bible? Hmmm. You bastard! Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over. We don't ''have'' respect for Mr. Garrison. Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?! Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she ''help'' but look at you! Ms. Ellen, dude! She's ''beautiful!'' Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents My ''laundry'' detergent? Yup!  Stop kissing ass, Cartman! Where's your present, Cartman? Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen! No, she wasn't! Oh cool. Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy. How did your date with Ms. Ellen go? A plebeian? Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians? Hey, yeah! Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat-ass. Really? And I got these killer Birken-stocks. Screw you guys, I'm ''king'' lesbian! Yeah! So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go? Down by the fire? You bastard! Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?! I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange. How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq- Wendy! You didn't! Whoa. Check it out, dude. It's got little drawings on it. I don't know. That was cool! You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now. No way, fatty, it's mine! You threw it away, fatso! Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'  You liar, Cartman! I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it. What would we use a marble sack for? I didn't steal ''anything''. Good! Whoa! No. Aagh! Stop that! Yyeeaahh. ''You'' threw it away, Cartman! Yeah. How'd you know? Triangle of ''Zin''thar? AAAAAA! Cartman? What the hell are you doing?! Well, Ike. ''You'' can tell Cartman that it's ''my'' triangle! Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, ''take'' the stupid triangle! If it'll make you leave me alone, then just ''take'' the damned thing! Here! There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel ''really, really good'' about yourself! Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would ''shut... up''. ''Your'' triangle? Oh, just this ''really really'' old lady who wishes she was still only 45. Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strangers? Hey! Don't try to pass it back on ''me'', fat-ass! Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home! Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks? Whoa, that was cool! You bastard! The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now. No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr! Disintegration is the best album everrr! We've ''got'' to get rid of them. Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! Well, that whole experience sure did suck. But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead. Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong Yeah. Whoa, dude. Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school. Come on! Let's go make fun of him! Really? Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman. Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them. Woo-whataya mean? How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs? Yeah, dude. It looks ''riveting''.  Hunh? Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on '''Full House'''. Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought. Wow, I wish ''we'' had a stupidest home video. Did you send the videotape to ''America's Stupidest Home Videos''? If we win, we can buy a ''new'' go-cart that ''actually runs''. You live on the Eastside, Cartman! You bastards! Yeah, with butterscotch. Woohoo! We're gonna win $10,000!  I'm gonna buy a ''Walkman'' with ''my'' half. Dude. What the hell is wrong with you? Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.  They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win! We're gonna win!. You bastards! Dammit! Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.  Dad, how ''could'' you?! Yeah, go home you little dildo! What's a dildo? I know what it means! I'm not telling you. He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  That's 'cause I was having these bogus nightmares. Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed... ...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room. Then slowly my bedroom door began to open...  ...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway. Weeaak! Then I was lying on a table... ...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes. What? No, it was just a dream, my mom said so. Oh, shut up, guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working. Kick ass.  Huh? Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned! Oh! Oh! No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that? No! Shut up, dildo! Oh! God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream! Shut up! Shut up you guys, it's not working. Heh, somebody's baking brownies.  Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh. Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you. Ow! My ass!  Uh... Ow! My ass! No, that was just a dream. No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.  Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry. Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.  Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger. I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you. Or slip her the tongue. You are making it up. What?  Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh? Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak! Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..! I would if I could, you son of a bitch!

Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight. I don't wanna. Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?! I'm sick of it! It's completely immature. You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up. Sure, you guys, what-ever. You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens! Oh, God damn it! What the hell are they talking about? You guys, get me down from here! Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos! Puh! Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night. Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.  why don't I have pinkeye then? Ahh, son of a bitch! Ugh, I hate those things. Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: "HEY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!"  I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things! Ohh, rain''bows''. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool. Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it. Nothing..! What? Kick ass! Yeah I do, Pop-Tarts are frosted. Oh, you know, this and that. There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid. Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time? You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous. Hey! That kid is me. Me! Eric Cartman! Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish. Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise. If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos? Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap! I can't. I have to go home and get in shape. Screw you, hippie!

Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake! Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame. You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you. Cartman, God damn it. Here it is, my big moment of fame. Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?  But I won the environmental essay contest. When is this going to be on the air? Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake! Okay, Mom. Dude, that's sick mom. Drive, Drive! Drive the car damn-it, drive! Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing. You piece of crap, I'll kill you! Eeeeenh! Hey, I didn't get a gun. Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off. My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa. Democrats piss me off! Kickass!! Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks. Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees! I got your back, soldier. Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything. I can shoot you too! I'll fill you full of lead! My weenies won't cook. Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah. Heh, tha-that's not scary. Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants! Hey, you would taste my pee! Hey you guys. I know a scary story. Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt? Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top. Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body. Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has... No! A piece of celery. Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy. What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink. Hey, it might be! Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell! They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually ''see'' Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow! I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.  Heheh. Those guys are totally scared. Holy crap! What the hell is wrong with you people?! Hey, wait, aah! You guys, it's just me. Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume. You guys, you guys, I was just kidding! Hey, seriously you guys! Hey! Goddammit, don't shoot me! I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now. Help! What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?! Yeah, cartoons kick ass!  Eh. You're making me sick, dude. No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park. Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester! I'll put a dollar on Sylvester. Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass. Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay. That dog is a gay homosexual. <poem><i>Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.</i></poem> What's homecoming? There he goes again. Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual. ...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television. Ah, dammit! Eeyy! Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-? That's not fair! Stupid puppet. You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass. Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog. Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen. He still looks pretty gay to me. There he goes! No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France. Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass! Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow! Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow! We'll just see about that. No I didn't. That was just my shoes. That's right, you get back there. Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye? Your sister beat you up again, huh? Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass. I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!" Be a man Stan. Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies." That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.  If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"  Yes ma'am. Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this! You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no! Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy! Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"  Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time. It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you. Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl! Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway. Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you. Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings. You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass! Come on Fluffy! UUuuhh. I sure am hungry. Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you! God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass. Gah, French people piss me off. Ugh!... Hey! I'll kick your ass! Whaaat?! I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant. Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again? Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!" I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all. No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this! Kyle no, seriously. No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I... Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts. Fluffy! Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime? Hey! I ain't helpin' crap! I want to eat some paeh. Oh yeah, watch me.  Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison. That'll do pig. Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet! That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew! That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss ''Terrance & Phillip'' last night! Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!  Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been? What? Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom! Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss ''Terrance & Phillip'' today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money. Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that? I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off. What! Hey! You piece of crap! I'll kill you! Don't talk about my mom like that! Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch! Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang. Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on! Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer. Oh, biiitch. Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh. Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming. Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again. Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny. Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart. I don't know. Why don't we just shoot him? Aaaah, runrunruuun! Ehh, eh, ehhhh! Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on. You son of a bitch, your mom sucks! Ohhh, God, No! My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool. Yeah! What the hell is that thing? There's no such thing as UFOs. Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass. Hey, dudes. It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil. My mom made it, isn't it cool? What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody? Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off! Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage. I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny! I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung! Poor piece of crap. There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh? You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!  Wookies don't live on Endor. What?! What did you say? Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you. Eating Kenny's pudding. Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself. That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool. My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil! Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o. Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!  Could I see that again? That was cool. I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.  I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost! Boo! I'm a ghost. Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad. Hey Chef. Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh? What is that? Who? Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him. Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master. Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking. God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!! Check. Yeah, granola pisses me off. Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny. Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire. I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!! I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate. Hi Wendy. You what?! Are you insane?! How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks? Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy. You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole! Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people! Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too. One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards! Can we have some candy now please?! I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit! Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy! Aaah! It was Kyle. Remember candy, focus on the candy. Eh, shit... You guys, shit... It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now! Hey, there's a pay phone! Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it! Aaah, kew! Finish her dude, she's a zombie now! Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest? Kill her Stan! Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on! Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. Well, let's go home, start eating that candy. Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money. Lehh, eh, screw you guys! Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on. And ''yeah'', we want Cheesy Poofs! Did you guys see that? That was sweet. Yeah, HEY! That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that? KICK ASS!! When do we get the sports watch? You vas-deferens! I get to wear it first, you guys. Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said. When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out? Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk? I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them! Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling! Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?! Well then, perhaps they ''should'', and decrease the surplus population! I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet? What the hell? Yeah, Starvin' Marvin. Hey mooom? We found a Etheropian, can we keep him? Sweet. No no! He's ''my'' son! I adopted him. Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor. Ahh! Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income. Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too? You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers. This is what you eat ''before'' you eat, to make you more hungry. Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. No Starvin' Marvin, that's ''my'' pot-pie. Oh yeah, you're right. Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here... Yeah, that's right. No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn. No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin! Oh well, back to the poor country with you. B-huh, huh. Yeah, right. Hey, hey, what's going on?! Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?! Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin! Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks! I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!! Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere. Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me? Well, screw you too! What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat. Ah, sweet! The Red Cross! I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please. What?! But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too! WEEEEEEAK!!! Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh... I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh. Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err. Huh, I wonder what's in here? SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM! Sally Struthers?! Gimme that cake! No Sally Struthers, you ''gimme that cake!'' No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh! You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!! That's right you will, God-Damnit. Move it POVs, I'm an American! Oohhhh! Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas! I'm not fat, I'm festively plump. What the hell is Christmas Poo? Hey! What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow! Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents. Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that. Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now. You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!  Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy. How do ''you'' know? Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what ''I'm'' getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000. I don't know, but it sounds pretty ''sweet''. Let me see! Is this some kind of Jewish tradition? Thanks to Kyle's ''mother''. How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor. Gross, Kyle! YOU SICK BASTARD! Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah! Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it. 'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went. Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home! Talking poo is where I draw the line! Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you! Yeah, something feels...unfinished. Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan... They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend. Thaat's right. <i>'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...</i> That's right. That's ri-''aayy''.  Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember! I shoved it up my ass! Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance ''you'' had of coming to ''my birthday'' party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap! Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde... No, my birthday isn't until Saturday. Eeeeeeh! Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party? Psych! I wasn't gonna ''give'' you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder? Byah. Oof!  Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! Eheh.  <i>You got in trouble, you got in trouble.</i> Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday. Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see? ''Oooh''. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then. Now. As you can see, Kenny, ''you'' are to get me ''Yellow'' Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo! Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two. Eeyy! Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man! Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, ''you'' were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday! Cartman's birthday! You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel. Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?! Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.  Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!  Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents? Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef. Hey! What the hell do you think ''you're'' doing here? Yeah. Come on in and join the party.  Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  You son of a bitch!  You were supposed to get me the red Mega Man, eh! Now I can't make the Ultra Mega Mega Man, you dirty cheap-ass piece of crap!  I hate you! I want you to die! Die!! Aah! Aaaaaggghhhhh!! That's it! Party is over! Everybody go home! Get the hell out, I said! The party's over! Get out goddammt!! Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.  That is so-ho lame! Oh man, I... Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.  Wow, she's pretty.  Yes, ma'am. Noh, he always pukes when he's in love. She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me! Until you puked on her. I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners  Memememememe, me! What's a multiplication table? We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen. Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!  Good-bye, Ms. Ellen. I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home. Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell. Nuh-uh! Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing! Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. Oh, hi, Chef. You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian. I am, too! My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet. This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian! I'm a bigger lesbian than you! Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. Dang! That's nice! Oh, weak, dude! Did you make love? No way! That's not what ''we'' just heard! What the hell...? Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box. Boooriing. No, ''I'' found it. No, ''I'' did, Pip. Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as ''you'' can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead. Okay, ready? I'll go first. Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! Eeyy! Give me that back! We'll ro-sham-bo for it! ANTHROPOLOGIST! I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!  Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! ...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan! Screw you, triangle thief! Eeyy! Oh I'll find it, don't worry! God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously. I was just ''setting it aside.'' Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do! Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it. Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him? What's that noise? Aaah! Aliens! No! I found it, he stole it! I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief. Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!  You scared the ''crap'' out of me, Ike! ''I'm trying to get my tri''- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back? Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddamn son of a bitch!! Huh?! Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with ''my'' triangle, now that it is ''mmyy'' triangle. Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers! Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as ''you'' can... It is? Yeeh, stealth bombers. Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen- Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! No, not when money is involved, stupid! Ugh. Let me go! Seriously! Eey! It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's! Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh. I don't remember. No! Don't! AAAAAA! AAAAADUH! WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand! Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is, it's inside my shoe. I suppose ''your'' socks smell like the Botanical Gardens! Yes! She stole my triangle! Make it go away! I ''hate'' Barbra Streisand! I ''hate'' her! Sweet! No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now! Huh? Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah! Thanks for your help! Visit us again! No! That's ''my'' walkie-talkie, he gave it to ''me!'' Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll ro-sham-bo you for it! Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass! Oh no! She's back! Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants? You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants. Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog? Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am. Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you.

So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha? So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?  That isn't a very romantic story, Mom. Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American. No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!  Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people. Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut! Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation. My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it? Hiya, Dad! I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance. Liane Cartman. But my mom says ''you're'' the guy she was with. Whatooya mean? Huh??

Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw? Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us. Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.  Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him. Dude! Dude! It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum! How can you eat when you're farting fire?  Where? Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her! I do not! Bleech!  Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.  What? How do you know she has a cat? Uh, Chef? Chef. Chef!  '''''CHEF!!!''''' Visitors took Kyle's baby brother. Whoa! Killer! Thanks, Chef. Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now. What the hell was that? Kyle, look! It's them. Oh my God! They've killed Kenny! Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay. Owww. Wow, poor Kenny. Dude, Kenny is dead! See? Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger. Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot.  But her note said she'd be here. Bleech! Bleech! Bleech! Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again. I think we have to signal them somehow. Come on Cartman, fart!  He can't hold it in forever. Hey, it's happening again. Now, do you believe us, Cartman? Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass! Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back. Yeah. That was beautiful, dude. No, they're leaving. Whoa, dude! Hey Wendy, what's a fuck?  Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with. Thanks for your help, Wendy. Hey, I didn't throw up. Bleech! Sorry. Cool. I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago. I don't know what the hell that is... Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around. I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows. Oh, hey Cartman. Really, what about? That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened. Yeah, it was huge. Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows? Cartman, what the hell are you talking about? What were you talking about? That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart. Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet. Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest. Yeah, that'd be cool.  We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy. Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly. Dolphins are way smarter than you! Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos! Tell me what you wrote about! Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master! What? You've got to weight 90 pounds. What's that stuff? Super fat-ass? Take that you stupid Indian! Shut up Cartman! Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination? Wendy, look! Mr. Garrison, stop! Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once? What about, not holding anything against the person who wins? Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches. We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison. Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo? Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman. Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer. You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman. Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says. My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa. Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there. Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo. Is this hunting? I can't. I don't wanna shoot the bunny. I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny. I can shoot ''you'', fat ass! I'll kill you! Yeah, Cartman's pee. Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too. Whatabutt? Why? A hook. Celery? Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories. Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets. What, dude? Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned? With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be ''my'' camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore? What? Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing! Yeah. Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg? No! I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal! I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard. Ah, damn it, I can't do it! Cartman? Whoa, he built a wicker basket. I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. Hey, that was easy! What?! Why?! No. But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny. Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons. Hiya, Sparky. That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop. Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy? He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain. He's not meaner than Sparky. Sparky'll kick his ass. That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! Sparky! Bad dog! What?! What do you mean? He's just confused. Sick, shut up dude! Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Huh? Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he ''is'' smart. Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down! Get down, Sparky! Down! Um, I'm not really prepared either. Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it- Wow, cool! Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question? What's a... homosexual? I guess. Shut up, dude! Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf? He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky. Good boy, now shake. Good boy. Now, don't be gay. Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay. I don't know. Come on you guys, I have an idea. Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't- Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?! No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. Atta boy, Spark! Get her! Yes! Ah crap! Now what do I do? I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil. Like who? Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual. Damn it! I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews. Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares? No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog! I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay. I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice. Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back. I think he might've run away. I'm not playing. I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog.  Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be? Sparky! Sparky! Fine, how are you? My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here. Do you have lots of gay dogs here? Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy. Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'? I missed you old pal, you really had me scared. Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game. We can work on making you not gay together. Sparky? What don't I understand? This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand. Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al! No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! I will Big Gay Al, I will. I've been getting my best friend back. Hike! Mph! Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys. And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year! And it's okay to be gay! Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing. I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety. It's true, I'll show you. But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club... Oh, there you are dude. How's it going? Wow! Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere. No! She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me. My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch! Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing? Yeah. Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant? Wow, that's cool! Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants. That'd be cool! Wait, wait. We still need a pig. Okay.  Yes... Oh, neither. It's my sister. Hi Shelly. Headgear? What headgear? Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice. No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH! Go where? Yeah, quit being such a baby. At least I'm not a little pig-fucker! Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses? Ow! Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?! Yeah! Go away, Pip! I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig. So how do we do that? Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house? Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit? Shut up Cartman! Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! Sick dude, she's my sister. Crap. No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace? Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you. No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me. Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. Sick! Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly? Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig. A big mutant version of me? I bet he weighs four hundred pounds. Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town. We have to find him. It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone. Stop! That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down. Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister? ...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad. No! Shelly bad, you good. He's tearing up the house, stop him! Come on Kyle, Cartman. Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me. You can't just leave me here alone. ''Thanks a lot.'' It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe! Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together. Uh, ahh, oooh. Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby! It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on. Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I? Aw, dammit! Heheheh hehehe... My name's not Billy, grandpa. It's Stan. Sure. I'm not gonna kill you, grandpa. 'Cause I'll get in trouble. Leave me alone, grandpa. I'm not going to kill you, grandpa! Good night, grandpa. Whoa! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there, Kenny! Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to? My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should. Really?? Wow! So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison? Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late. Yeah... Hey Chef. Bad. Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa? No, I mean, kill my grandpa. See, I told you dude. What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this??? Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay. No grandpa, I'll get in trouble. No, I can't even kill a deer. Grandpa! Come on, Cartman, he's just trying to get to you. We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen. Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes. I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die. Hey, yeah! Jesus? Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay? Yes? Goddammit! What the hell is wrong with everybody? Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole! Okay, grandpa, okay. Just get out of the way of the TV. We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it. Aaah!! We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and... Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever. Aww, do I have to? Hey, what are you doing?! Uh, I guess. Okay, you, you can let me out now. Let me out, grandpa! I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand. Sure I will grandpa, I will. Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up? 'Kay, come on guys. You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted. Are you ready, grandpa? Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you. What is that?! Hey, he's coming towards us. Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him! Yeah, but, mom! Dad, Death is coming! Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place. Good point man. Ahhhh!  Hey look! Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time. Whoa! Come on you guys, let's go home. What do you mean? I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes. Cool! What are you doing grandpa? That's my silly grandpa. Oh my God! They killed Kenny! Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. Shut up Kyle! I'm Raggedy Andy. Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure. Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy. Where'd you get that? No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass! I'll kick your ass, Kyle! Hey look, Kenny's not dead. Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you? Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank. I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank." Whoa, dude! Wendy? You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember? We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair. You what?! He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything. Oh man, I feel like a total choad. Hey, where's Kyle? Whoa, dude! Yeah, me too. Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween! I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me. I bet I get more candy than you dude. No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference. Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine! Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight... Plastic pumpkin pails... Taser... For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.  How's your barrel full of candy Wendy? I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day. Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy! No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! Dude, Kenny! Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops. Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore! What are you talking about Chef? Oh my God, that means... Wait, where are we going? I don't know about this Chef. What are we doing here Chef? What? We told you dude. Hey Chef. Look Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? Let's get out of here! We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline. You call the number Kyle. We'll hold 'em off. Sweet! Wendy? I know, but uh-... but... Hey, yeah!  Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it. I, I can't. Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay. That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead. Oh man, I can't believe he's gone. Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw. You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving. Oh, then, what's Halloween about? Oh. Yeah. Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month. That was awesome! Hey, who's that fat chick? Oh. Doesn't look like ''she's'' having any trouble finding food. SWEET! I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. Hello? Is this Sally Struthers? Oh. Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear. Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian. Just a second fat-ass! Hello? No, no, it's a ma- ''[To his friends, confused.] Vas-deferens?'' Oh. Do we get the sports watch right away? She says we do. You mean, like Kenny? Damn. Dude, that's not a digital sports watch. Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch. Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds? I think he said his name is Marvin. Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow. It was ''my'' mom's credit card. This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.' Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to ''share.'' Yeah, yeah, we do! He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch. No. So why can't he live here now? This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend. Hey, where's Cartman? Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! Oh my god, they've killed Kenny! We did it!! Wow, it sucks he has to leave. You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people. But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I. Lights, please. Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle? ''Christmas'' Poo? Whoa, Christmas snow! That was sick, dude! ...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude. Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas. We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude? See you around, dude. The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet. Yeah. You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas! 'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night. What's that? What's in the box, dude?  Dude, sick!!! Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep. Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please. I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him. This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen. We committed him. Huh?! O-oh. This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey! I believe. Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too. Wh-what could it be? Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year? Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too. Whoa, dude! Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'? ''Dude''. You're not supposed to ''tell'' people what to get you for your birthday. Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid? Hey new kid! Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog. What the... ? A ''what''? Hey, Chef. Whoa! Jesus, Jesus! No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil. This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you. Yeah.  Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid. You're gonna fight Satan?  I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday? Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in. Did the Devil show up yet? Holy crap, dude. Satan is ''huge''. Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'. Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart. Bubye, Fart-boy. Hey, Jesus. Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God. Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs. But you're his sparring partner, Chef. Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili. Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid. Whoa, that was cool! Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out! [swings his left arm] Aaanh, he does this all the time. Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've ''got'' to ''fight'', Jesus. Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One! Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't ''settle'' for second-best! She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!  What?  ... Really? Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks. You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'. ''You'' did, Jesus. Nah, I saw it on '''Star Trek'''.  Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan. Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You're leaving already? Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid. Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security? I know. I can't afford a cruise, dude. Shut up, Cartman! You can say ''that'' again. Yeu-bluuuch. I'll kick your ass, Cartman! Bluuuch. You guy can stop fighting. It was ''me'' she was checking out! Yeah, that one! No. Sure, Wendy, whatever. Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! Bluuch! I'd love to. That's not Kyle's... We've ''got'' to learn how to do that, dude!  Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift. Bluuch. See? She liked ''my'' present the best! No you're not! I don't think I missed ''any''! I bet I scored 100! Oh, hi, Wendy. That's impossible! What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her? A whatbian? Kenny? No, explain it to us, Chef. Oh. Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too! You're just saying that, Cartman. What the hell are you doing, Cartman? Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was ''perfect''. I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am. No, you're a ''fatter'' lesbian than me. Wow. Hi, Wendy. Wow! Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back. Bluuch. Kick ass! Are we making love now? They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet. You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says. But why? It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it? I think so. Yup. Yup. Did I ''what''? Oh my God, she killed Kenny! Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive. Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff. Bluuuuch! Sorry. Isn't that ''your'' job? Oooh. Dude. Shut up, Cartman. What is it? Whoa! What are you going to do with it, dude? You ''did'' throw it away, Cartman. Well, you might as well let it go. I have a button we can use for his nose. Ow, that sucks, dude! ...so? Like John Elway important? D'you know John Elway? Oh, so you're ''really'' famous and important but you don't know John Elway! Why do you wanta know, lady?! Whoa, dude! ''It's Saturday.'' Man, the bus sure is late. Fine. Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it. Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. Yeah, let us go! Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. Get us down from here! Robert Smith? Sweet! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef? Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!  Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.  Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless! He did it! Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived! Good-bye, Robert Smith! Well, what should we do with the two triangles now? Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me. Go to hell, Cartman! Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with. Yeah. Oh my God! Look! Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school. Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch! I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch. I always wondered if that would work. In the backyard?  Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help. Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals. No. Is that legal? Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made. I donnow, just keep rolling. Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape ''Not Without My Anus'' next week! Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch ''Terrance and Phillip''. Aaawww. This guy sucks! Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace? What?? What are you talking about, Cartman?! Go ahead, dude. Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick! Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it. Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.  Shhh! Here comes Cartman. Cartman?! Dude, I thought you said you were Native American. Dude. We should be videotaping ''this''. We could make ''another'' $10,000. Oh my God, they've killed Kenny. Huh?  Oh yeah. How 'bout some ice cream? Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals! Man! Cartman's gonna be famous!  Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on ''America's Stupidest Home Videos''. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever. How's it going, Cartman? Come on, what's the matter, Cartman? Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude. Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for ''America's Stupidest Home Videos'', and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize. Uh, yyeah. Uuh, you'll see. We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny! Dude. We ''lost''. Grandpa!! Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but ''Goddamn!'' (It's a plastic dick that goes in a vagina.)  Don't kick the baby. Eneh probe.  Oh foonuh bebe. Eeeeee! Purplor. Help me doy tair. Don't hurt me. Don't kick the baby. It's my turn! Oh, he fly out the sky. Oh oh. On flame? Oh oh. On flame? Cokeshen. Rear trohtru badt. Cookeh monter. Ahtoahtahneurah.  Hello there, children.  Hey, Chef. Hey, Chef. Bad. Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley. Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night? Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes? Oh!  Did they give you an anal probe? That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt. Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. Hello there, children. How are you doing? Why bad? <poem>--get those juices flowin'--</poem> <poem>--we're makin' love gravy--</poem> <poem>--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!</poem> <poem>Love luh--</poem> Huh? Do you feel better? Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day. What?! What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it! It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device. This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us. It's no joke, children, this is big! Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children.  Okay children, this is your chance! Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready. Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before ''Sanford and Son'' is on. Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back! Well, i- it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.  Hello there children. How are my little crackers today? Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park. Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked <i>me</i> to sing at the ceremony. Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation. Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. <poem><i>Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.</i></poem> <poem><i>How 'bout you and meee-</i></poem> <poem><i>-get together and make... sweet... </i></poem> love? He needs to run his ass around the block a few times. Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me? But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf? Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now! Come on everybody. You got to help the children. That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ''ever'' seen! Oh no, look. That's Scuzzlebutt. Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park. But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. Yes Pip, what is it? I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody. Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does. Sorry son, now get your ass in there.  Hike the damn ball!  Huh? Oh, fine, fine. Elementary school alumni? I don't know. Wha- what's the spread? Hmmm... I don't think we have a chance. Great pass, Stan! Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow. <poem><i>Spank it, ever so gently.</i></poem> <poem><i>Spank it.</i></poem> Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays. No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you. That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it? What's the matter, Stan? You seem down. Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks. Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic. Well, you're gay aren't you? Well, you sure do act like it.  Oohh, come on, Stan... No Pip, I'm sorry! You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle. Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now. What's the matter? Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty. Hike! The! Ball! Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field! Where the hell have you been Stan?! Just get in there boy! Hello there children. How you doin'? Why bad? Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'? Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house. Children, we could make a fortune with this. Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love. Sure they would. But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood. Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk. Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going. Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Thank you Elton. <poem><i>Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.</i></poem> Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life. The beauty of Mother Nature. Hmm, now I know how all those ''white'' women must have felt. Oh, they will. It's gonna be one uuuugly sight. Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children. Uh oh, here we go. Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig. Or a big fat elephant. Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days. Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill. Hello there children. How's it goin'? Why bad? You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on. No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal. I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole. Hello, children. What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?! Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis? Hello, children. Aaaaah! Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you? Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye! Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before. Doctor! No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead. Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so! Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr! Oh, sorry. But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here. Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness? Aaaaaaaaaah! Mayor, we've got a big problem. Actually, uh- I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead! No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!  Aw, the hell with you both! Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!  Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them. Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?! Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha! Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately? Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town. I'm working on it children. The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. Just look for anything suspicious. You better let me take that Kyle. I gotta call this hotline number children. Look out children! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! You did it children! Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees. Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts. Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA. What does it mean? Oh, fudge! Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again. It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria! Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards! What the-?! Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your... What the hell are ''you'' supposed to be anyway? No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything. Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry! We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.  Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!! Stay close children. We've saved Thanksgiving! Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives. Yeah, yeah, yeah. <poem><i>...We should make love,</i></poem> <poem><i>...'Cause if we don't-</i></poem> Say, where's Kyle? What? Why? ''Chirst''mas poo? You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey. Well! You can believe in him now. Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey! I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey. The whole town is about to ''kill'' each other. Hello there, children. How's it going? Why bad? <poem><i>With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,</i></poem> <poem><i>Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...</i></poem> What were we talking about again? Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! We've got to do something, children! Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you! Not you, dammit! Ooh crap. Oh ooh. ''[In the ring.] ''Ah-ah-ah I ''can't''. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never ''speak'' to me again. Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright? Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?! Yup! Here's your present, children. Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later. I know, but the fight is starting. Mmmmm. That's ''my'' favorite ''kind'' of chili. Come on, children! We can ''still'' catch the end of the fight! Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?  Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher? Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful? Wooof! I've got to meet ''this'' woman. That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other... Thaat's ''right''! That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... Oh, hello.  I'm Chef. I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground. Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place. What was your name again? ''Well'', I'm sure there's no substitute for ''you''. If we can have dinner tonight.  Hello there, children. Not too good. No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team. Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion. Don't you understand? She's a ''lesbian''. You boys don't know what a lesbian is? Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians. Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV. Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at an Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in ''my'' cafeteria. I'm Chef. Barbra Streisand? You mean like, ''the'' Barbra Streisand? No. Not since '''Yentl'''. Too late for what? Why do ''you'' care? I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin. Come on, man. What is this all about? Hmmm. Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope. Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a rumor. It was ''just a rumor.'' A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.  Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about! Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-. Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman? Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this! Forget I asked! And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has? ''Mega''-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell ''that'' means, but it doesn't sound good. Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all. There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B. Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too! Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin? Where? Ooh, fudge! Children! I can't - break these - locks! Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure? This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you. Look out, children! Sidney Poitier? Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in ''my'' hometown! Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.  Is ''that'' really necessary?  It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town. We have to say good-bye... to South Park.  Who are you? You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin ''and'' Sidney Poitier. Hey! Where's he goin'? Hello?  Boy, what the fudge are you doin'? Get in here!  Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?! What?! Noh! Uh, did I? Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children. Of course not. Here. You children sit down, Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember. And ''that's...'' who she was with last! Mr. Garrison! SIT DOWN! WE"RE RUNNING LATE! SIT DOWN BACK THERE! AAAAAAH!! WHAT DID YOU SAY?  Oh. SIT DOWN, KID! DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL!? Then sit down! Arrgghhh! WHAT DID YOU SAY?! Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do. Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing? Oh—I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus. SIT DOWN KID!!! COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE! WHAT DID YOU SAY?! Oh, neither can I. Come on, we're running late! What did you say?! Oh. Alright, then.  Visitors! (Oh nooo!) (Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.) (Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!)  (Nope, I'm all fine. Agh!) (How big's your penis, Chef?) (They're the biggest breasts that I've seen) (Oh no!) (Maybe she'll suck my dick.) (Hey, what's that?) (A little like a vagina.) (Thanks.) (Nope, I'm okay.) (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!) (Ugh.) (Hey guys, what's goin' down?) (Oh, no!) (Oh my God, I think they're screwing.) (No, check his penis.) (I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.) (Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.) Mmmmmm! (Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?) ("And I want to see you handling your breasts.") (A big mutant Stan?!) (Look at that! What's he doin'?) (I have to go poop.) (I did, I gotta go again...) ('''OH MY GOD!''') (Owww!)  (Oh my God!) (Ow!) (You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.) (Heeeeyyyy, kick ass.) (Ow!) (Woohoo!) (Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee) (O-Oh.) (Kyle has Jesus' ''head'' instead!) P'tooui. (Kyle's crazy!) (That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!) (Hunh?) (Phew!) (Yee he hee!) (Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!) Quack-quack. Quack-quack. Quack-quack. (Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!) (Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!) (Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!) (And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?) (Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?) (Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!) (Ugh!) (Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.) (I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.) (Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!) (Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'- (AARGH.) (Goddamn, why-) (Oh this freakin'-) (AARGH.) (Phew.) (Well, I'm fine, guys!) (Now if I can-) Arrrggghhh! That's the third cow this month. At this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through. This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time. UFO's?  That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. That, that was a pigeon. There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.  Hold it right there, cows! Come back here! Now then!  Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. Nice Gun. Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet. No problem. Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee! What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute.  Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!  Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat? You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt. Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. OK, any questions? That's enough out of you! This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here. You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -  Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here. Carry on. You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.  Not a thingy-dingy. Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle? Righty-o. Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos. Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister. What? Yyess. What seems to be the problemo here? Boys, shouldn't you be in school? No excuses, move along, you little troublemakers! Well what? Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass! Hoh, what a bitch! Huh?! Where?! People been saying they've been seeing UFO's around. Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks. What was that? What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one? Hey! My cattle! You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on! And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus. That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492, Columbus started a restaurant... Well, Kyle, NO!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.  Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you? We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge. But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.  Kill her.  Kill her. Kill! She'll make a fool of you again.  It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.  The bitch must die! Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids. We can still get her! Let mmm-- Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star? Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it. Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback? Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game. That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better. Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people. I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother? Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison. Roar. That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second? It sure is, Mr. Garrison! I think it looks great. You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison. Is there a problem, boys? Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor? I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat? Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat. Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle. Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?  What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town. Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month?  One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize. That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman. Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper. Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner. Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford? And the presentation will be on national television.  Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it. Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement. Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat? Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child. It wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that? How? No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't <i>kill Kathie Lee Gifford!</i> That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.  Mr. Hat! Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her. No, no! No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it. That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat. Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy. Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top. Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage. Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage. Do you have a feather on your head? Then you're an Indian. Okay Bebe, this is your line. They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy. Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days. To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford! Oh my God, what have I said? I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it. Yes... I need a gun. Other.  I don't know, it's a little small.  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.  I'll take it! Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang! Thank you. Thanks. Hello Officer Barbrady. Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee. Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady. Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford. Come on you little bitch.  You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy. Leave us. We must finish what we have begun. You can't know. ...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once. It is... too late for me, young Wendy. You... you're right. Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy. I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV. Really, on what? Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets. South Park is saved. Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-. Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat? Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next. Well, just make something up, like Eric did. Excellent. A-. Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people. Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan. Well of course Stanley, what is it? Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down. Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold, black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand? Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual. Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda. What do you mean? What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay. I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass. Hey hey, where is little Stanley? Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.  It's obvious where all the talent in that family went! I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo. What the hell is he talking about? Do what? And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering. Yes Kyle. Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes. Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war. You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute? I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home? Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.  Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, ''give me back my cocoa!'' Stan, are you wearing a different hat? Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention. Aaaaaah! Ooooh. Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?! You have got severe lunchroom duty mister! Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this. Everyone, let's give Casey and his weed a big hand. Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project. Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'. Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project. Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful. Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence? Hmm, what are the odds of that? Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night. She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called ''Terrance & Phillip''. That's right, Mr. Hat. Shows like ''Terrance & Phillip'' are what we call 'toilet humor'. They don't expand your minds. You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash. Kenny, why are you late to class? Oh, okay Kenny, be seated. Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because... Yes Kenny, what is it? I thought you just came from the bathroom. Okay okay, go ahead. As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. Pay attention children! I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' any more, ever. That's right, children. Are there any questions? Yes, Stanley? What, what do you mean? Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole. Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters. No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me. It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle. Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel- Is there a problem Kenny? Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay? Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes. Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers. Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume. ...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children.  Yeah. Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe. That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing. Wait your turn Clyde. Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is? Yes, Eric? Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people. A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving. Exactly.  I don't know Eric, they just do. Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people. Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat? What the hell is going on?! Well, you don't see that everyday. Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive. And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn? Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving. Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, ''hoo.'' Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell. All right boys, show us what you've brought. Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you ''get'' this child? The sports watch from the commercial? Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned. Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you? And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains. Well, I'm ''trying'' to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head. ...So? Because it's Christmas??? Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you? Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus? The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go? See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan. Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark? You ''are'' the Jewish community! Can we get rid of all the Mexicans? Rats! Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too? Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus. So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs. Yes, Eric? What the...  Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric? Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any ''Christmas'' lights, since they offend people with epilepsy... ...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?  Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.  Okay. Now let's practice our... Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on? Oh brother. Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage? And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there. Okay, kids, get ready to take your places. ''You're'' the ones who made it this way!  Children, children! Today is a very special day. I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today. Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate...  uh-uh, what's your name again? Say 'hi' to Damien!  And where are you from, Damien? Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama. Your father? ''Wow'', we have ''royalty'' in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era. Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass... Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? Holy poop on a stick! Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too. Wai-wa I was here first. Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too. Yeah, crazy. Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight! Yeah, what a mean thing to do! Boy, did we get screwed. Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes. Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat? Hmmm. Oh, that's not bad. WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want! I can live with that. Where-eh, where am I? Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look? Ah-I feel kinda nauseous. Aauugh-huh. UUUUUuuuuuugh Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible! Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father! Well? Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat? Hi, Mrs. Campbell. Really? No, but thanks for asking. Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us. Hello there, children! Children, I have a very important announcement to make. I'm quitting my job as a teacher. It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks. But the good news is, I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher. I'm a lady ''killer'', Mr. Hat. A ''few hundred''? Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack. Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring. What the...? Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah. Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself! Hoh, Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job. Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!! We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again! Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep. We're doomed! Good-bye, Mr. Hat. Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat. Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem!  Another Cosmo, please. What the hell are you talking about, Eric?  Oh. I am not gay! No! Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?! Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman? ...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs! So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know.  Yes! For God's sake, get on with it! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! Hey, you cows can't get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? 'Cause you're cows. No, no, no. Don't try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? 'Cause it's not gonna work. So then I had bad, bad gas. Mabin. Ya, seriously, killer. Naw, it's pretty fresh. Hi, guys. Hi, Wendy.  Bye, Wendy. Here, Stan. This is for you.  Eww!  Hi, Stan. Eww! But why, Stan? Eww!  Huh? What happened to your little brother? Well, why don't you go get the fat kid? Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back. Come on, Stan.  Eww!  Hey, he's like Rudolph. Whatever, dude. Cool! Eww! Hey, look. A French fry. And what is that? Hey, what's that? Oh hey, what about that?  Wow, I knew I would win. What? He doesn't even know what he wrote about! My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins. What?  Hitler was famous too. Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated. Hi guys. I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this. Hello? My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."  Oh my God.  You guys, we have to stop him! Mr. Garrison!He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford! He's got a gun! It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!  Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?  Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him! I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people. You should have won that talent show. I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer. You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose. Gooood. You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it. I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place. Well, not if it's Cartman. Hey, where are you all going! They don't even know what Walden is. I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was. Ah, what the hell. Hi, Stan. Yeahhh? I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look. I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca. Eww. Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating. Hi guys. Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi. Let's go trick-or-treats. Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad. But Stan! AAAAAAAAAAAH! Aaahahah! Aaahh. Aaah! Aaah! Oh, what happened? Stan? I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings. Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan. Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross! Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?! This is the one time of year you're supposed to ''care'' about people who can't eat! Many would rather ''die'' than go to those places! Unh  Oh! Aaaah! UUuuhh-UUuuhh. Okay. You guys, look! It's snowing! Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue. It's fun. Yeah. I believe in Mr. Hankey. Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day. Maybe we should go on a cruise or something. I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and ''pretend'' it's a cruise.  -and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.  Stan? ''Stan?!''  Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one? ''Well it is!'' Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?  Stan? We're still Valentines, right? Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you? I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan. Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen? Don't fuck with me! You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen. When someone gets as old as you, Do they have to wear Depends undergarments? Hi, Stan. ''HI, STAN!'' I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen. ''Yes, she was!'' Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it! It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun! ''NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!'' Thanks for coming over, Bebe. That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes ''everything'' from me, Bebe. Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice ''me'' again. Bebe, I need a makeover. Hi guys, what's up? Oh. Hi, Stan. I think it worked, Bebe. DIE!! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison! He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now. Wwhat? You...you ''can't''. Noooo! Noooo! ''Nooo!! Nooo!!'' AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! It's over. I give up. Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you? No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting. No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends. And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong, ...and I've learned from it. I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world. Oh, coool! Wow. What incredible irony. Yeah, you just never know. Happy Valentine's Day, Staan. Eeewwww! No, it's okay, Stan! Everything's going to be o-kay! Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher. Oh, hi, Kyle! U-huh. Excuse me. Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq! Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq! Kaqemblaq! Wait, wait! It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing! Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen. I told her.  Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger! Hello, Eric. How are you doing? Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise. You're not fat, you're big boned. You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you? Just a weensy eensy woo woo? How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then? Yes, hon? Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too? Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight! Eric, look who's here. That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.  Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow. Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow. But tomorrow is grocery day Eric. Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then. Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous. Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts. Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. You give your mommy a kissy. Scuzzlebutt saved the day. Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth. Ohhh, okay hon. Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working. Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?  Ohhh, yes, indeedy. Hello there! Happy Halloween! Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs? Sure hon.  Not yet hon. Yes hon? Sure, hon. You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon? Okay. Come on, kiddies. Eat more. Mmmmm. More pie, hon? Hello, boys. Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard. How is your beefy roast, snookums? Sure, hon. Uh huuuh. Yyeess?? Well, what's your question, hon? Oooooohh. Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other. And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. I was young and naive then... And then I saw ''him''. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin. Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him. I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town. As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns. Could it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth? Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Moo... Moo...Moo moo, moo moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.) Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.) Moo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.) Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.) Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!) Moo?? (Really??) Mooo.  Mooooo? Moo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?) Moooo! Mooo! Moo...moo...moo moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!) Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us. What's happening? Television! Whoa! Chef! No! Come on, Kenny! Jesus? Our Savior! Whoa! Hold on, Kenny! Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town. Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator. That's right, he's a black guy isn't he? Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children. Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay. Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park. Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play. Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best! And who's our little prize winner again? How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we? Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows! Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going? Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it. Oh, don't they look adorable? Oh my God! Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!? Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.  Where is she? Here she comes.  It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. ...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford. WHAT?! What? Oh God! Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song. Thank you Chef! And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman... ...is your favorite celebrity, and mine,  Kathie Lee Gifford! Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots! We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but... My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up. Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office! Just send in the geometrist. You are fired, buddy! What does this mean to the town? My God! Ooh, this ''is'' big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there?  Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control. All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over? Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids. Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?! Huh, what? And, that would be good? Right? Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels! God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv- What... is that ''thing''? Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go? Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt. Oh, how sweet. Turn off the cameras! I just had a brown baby boy. Ugh! Why, why Chef. What a surprise! You mean, Tina Yothers? Well, let's get back to it. Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor. Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?  Uh huh.  Of course. Naturally. Oh, do go on. You were saying?  Oh, my! Uh now ''why'' would you say that? So how does this thing work? POVVVV? Ohhoho, brilliant. Daah!! What the hell is this!! OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD! All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa. Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab. Come on, hurry up. Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip! Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy! Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family. It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- ''string beans.'' Hehe. Chef, the turkeys! People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys. Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?! Does my hair look okay? Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down. Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise. Perhaps we need a ''new'' icon for Christmas. Ex-cuse me? Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions? Yes, Mr. Garrison. No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans. Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group! Is anyone offended by mistletoe? Lose the mistletoe!  Hmmm. Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity. Mayor, we should decorate the town square. Black as the night itself, Mayor. If they're working in a sweat-shop that is. Ouch.  Thank you. Uh, Mayor, the mic is on. Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted. Maybe even a State Senator. Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town. Ohhh. Mayor, the geologist is here to see you. No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth. I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker. Geologist... Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you. Uuuuuuuuuuuuuhh! Piiink eyyye. Hey, Chef. Good. Hey, Chef. Hey Kenny. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this. May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver... And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access. That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews. And now back to ''Terrance & Phillip''. And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access. And now back to Terrance & Phillip. Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather. We interrupt this program to bring you loud static. And now back to She's the Sheriff.

Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night? Not watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' ever? Owww, you bit my arm! Brainnns. Ahh. Aaaah! Aaaah! Me too. I bet I can spit the most on him. Whoa. Is that Wendy Testaburger? Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool? Hooray for Eric! I think you're a big fat piece of crap. Naw, you're not fat.  This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land. Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers. The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands. I want a pot-bellied elephant. I want a Starvin' Marvin. Our slide! Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair. You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds! That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway? Really? Oh, cool.  Yeah. He said, "To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!" God damn, that's a big fat ass! Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun. You're a dead man, Jimbo! Speech! Aaaah! Ha ha, green apple splatters. Huh? Oh god! Oh god! Look! It's the president of the network. Wait, wait. Huh, oh no! Can I help you? Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other? Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on! That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes. Okay, how about this? Here's the same gun, with a wood finish. That's right, Stanley. Animals are ''much'' easier to shoot in the morning. Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe. Oh, ho, that's disgusting. That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'. Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ''ever'' walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber. You what?!? Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization. Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes. Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer. Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us! Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality. You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting. They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.' Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us! Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.  Let's move, moove! This one's yours Stan. It's coming right for us. What the? What's wrong with you? What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical. No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger. Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick. Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!! Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home? And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day. Hah, got ya. Hey Ned, hand me that gin. You boys want to tie one on? What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol? Christ, look at that little bastard go! Now you see that Stan? Now, now ''that'' is a dirty little bastard! Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song. What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there! Great instincts boy. Who? The fat kid? Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20! Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit. Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew. Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off. Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on. Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast. Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us! Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun. Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing. This calls for some HJ-14. Fire in the hoooole! Damn it, I think I missed. C'mon, let's move, move! These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe. Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt? I can't tell; let's kill it! Kenny, you take the front. That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt! You pansy! give me that gun. What the Sam Hell? Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that- The mountain! It's blown it's top! That lava's coming right for us!! What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across! Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt! Quick Ned, shoot it! Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed. Hey, he's saving us. Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that! Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See? But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill ''anything.'' You understand? Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef? I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni. That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year? Middle Park by 70 points. Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback.  Right Stanley? Atta boy! Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie! I want $500 on the South Park Cows. No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread. Whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now uh... Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself. Not ''that'' sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be? 'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget. What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime. Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F. You know, <poem><i>Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah.</i></poem> No, dammit! The ''aaaaah''! ''Aaaaahh''! Great. You got it. ''Aaaaahh''!  Come on Ned, and keep quiet. Hello there, Enrique. Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead. And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in "Loving You", BOOM! No more Middle Park players! God damn, I love football! Ned, look! They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached. Hell's bells. Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh. What the hell?! He didn't sing the high F! Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked. Yeah! Yohooooh! Give 'em hell, Stanley! Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus? Yeah! Wooo! Yeah! Woohoo! What?! No! There you are! Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a ''good explanation'' for this mister! I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley. The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned. What the hell's going on here? Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie! We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince. Now ''that'' is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!  Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on. I wanna change my bet to Satan. Yeah. No way! He barely touched him! Yeah! Man, that guy is a ''jerk''. Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus! Ih-it's comin' right for us! Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen! Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here. Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance! Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay. He's gay!!  Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean. Nope. He's gay.  Daaagh! Nice gun Mr. Garrison. We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh. Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago! I love you, too. Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee! 1 1 Thank you. I love you all. It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?  Aaaooghhhh! Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef? Gun! Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch. Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up. Have you seen anyone fitting this description. There you are. Are you ready to go home now? Gun! Excuse me sir, we're looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch. I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up. Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest. Who cares? Look, the volcano. We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo. Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone. Quick, duck and cover. Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house. Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there? Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today? mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm. Were you stationed in Da Nang? Mmm, Jimbo look, mm. Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock. It's coming right for us. Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm. Mmm, yepper. Mmm, aahh, oh. Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm. Mmmowwwh. Mmm, got it.  Moh man it smells like dead fish here. Em-moh man, that is nasty. There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm. Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas. Mmm, what is it? We'll be on the cover of "Guns & Ammo". Mmm, so much for the cover of "Guns & Ammo". Mmm, holy crap. Mmmoh no, out of ammo. Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm. Are you sure Stan is that good? I love that song. ''Aaaaahh''. ''Doo-nn-doo-doo'' ''Aaa - dooo''...  Okay. What are we doing here? Yay. Me, too. Okay. Aah! aah! I'm scaared! Could be. What the heck is this? I agree. Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check. Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt. Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad. Right now South Park is here. Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea. Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely. Uh - pretty sure. And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon. Uhh... Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing? Huh? Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions. How's it feel to be 102, paps? Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa. Me. Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh. Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison. Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh. Did you turn the heat down? Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won. Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son? The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony. Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe? Huh? As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary. It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava. And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity. Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome? Oh my God! What has he done? As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors. Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is... Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement! Yeahhh. Yeah, alright! Wooooh! Woooo! Wooo, yeahhh, woo. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV! Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a  May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt. That's right Jane, duck and cover. So what will you  -do when you hear a volcano erupting? That's right, duck and cover. Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye. Aaaaah! Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy. Noooo! Why God? Why?! Grrrr. Grrr. Friend. Aaaaah. Arrrrrr. Uh, Mr. Chef, sir? Uh, I still don't have a helmet. Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me? Oh. Aaaaaaaargh! Uh, Mr. Chef sir? Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without? No um, I guess not. Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet? Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one. 'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today? Lunchy munchies, hmmm? Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue... Righto. Eho! Piiink eye! Aaah! Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one. Oh, Eric. I didn't ''get'' an invitation. Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me. Right-o.  Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday. Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it. Good day, Damien. How are you? Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call ''me'' that anymore. Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there. Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on ''me''. Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but- Aaaa! Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty. Oh! Oh I think I found one! Oh. I do believe I found it first. Oh dear. What do you mean? Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must. Well-uh I, I guess you win. Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe! I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay. Gay dog. Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately? Gay dog. Stupid gay pig. Yeah, that was stupid. That was stupid. Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss. Yehaha. Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan. Huh, huh. Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbra Streisand concert.  Stupid little gay dog. Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too. Hopefully not a gay clone. Stupid. Yeahh, they're all gay. Heheh. Heheh. Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh. Huhuh. Bark, bark. Ruff. Barr. Ruff! Are you crazy? You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'. I want to put all my money on the Cows. Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it. Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too. I got 500 on the Cows. Well, I'll put my money on the Cows. You better be right about this, Jimbo. Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air.  Yeah, is- is this Jesus? This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife. Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins too, that was really nice of you. Yeah, is this Jesus? Yes my son. Of course Robert. How are things now? Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air.  My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see- Leave me alone. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Yes, my son.  -- Yea, the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and- Jesus! Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace. First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'. Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback. Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know. Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question? Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance. Next caller, you're on the air. Yes my son? My son... I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole. Next caller. I heard that. <poem><i>Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...</i></poem> Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou.  Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show. Wow. That's pretty heavy. The ''Dark Prince?'' So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One. Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth. Damien! So it is thou, Son of ''Lucifer''! Let him come then. I shall stop him! Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - ''right here in South Park!'' This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history. Not yet. ... What the hell do you mean ''if'' I win the fight? Oh. Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation. Behold. The Evil One approaches. Oh - oh yeah?? Oh yeah?? Aw, come on! I weigh more than that. Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar- I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning. In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me! Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too! I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win. ''You're all a bunch of Judases!'' What are you doing out so late, kids? Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right? No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little? No way, dude! Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train. Give it your best sho-  Anybody get the number of that truck?  Oh! Oow!  Ooooooh! Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on ''Satan''. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook. It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up. ... Who said that? You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys! Okay, pal. ''You asked'' for it! Aw heck.  Do I have a choice? Our Savior! What moment would that be? What high F? Right, right, so you want the trigger on the ''doo-nn-doo''? ''Aaaaahh''? ''Aaaaahh''. ''Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah''. ''Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...'' Alright, yeah, okay... Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al. Have you been outcast? Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us? Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here. Hi little fella, how are you doing today? I'm super, thanks for asking. Well, let's see. Come on in.  We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion. And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you! Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance? Young man, it appears you still don't understand. Come this way, I have to show you something. Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride. Step aboard, Stanley. Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time. You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan. Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my! Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely. Sooo, what do you think, Stan?  Isn't this precious? No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches? Oh Stan? When you get back to town,  tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately. Ooh, my carrot cake!  I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here. I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done. Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you. Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken! Hold him, hold him! Hold him, hold him! Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows. Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up. Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski. Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes! Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter. Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King. Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that. With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0. Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant. Sorry, sorry. And the South Park Cows are set to receive... There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick. He's at the 50, the 40, the 30. The little running back is down. I think he's... Yes, he's been decapitated. Ouch-a-roo! Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot. And now, here to sing the touching song ''Loving You'', is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother... And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since... Well, this should just about wrap it up for- Wait a minute, what's this? It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback! Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass. And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid! Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938! Touchdown! The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread! Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory? Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time? Play ball. Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles. One... Two... Three... ... Seven... Eight. ... Nine... Ten. You're out! Rooaar. <poem><i>Oww, we can both be gay!</i></poem> <poem><i>...both be gay.</i></poem> Break! You guys are toast. Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in. Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again. Dude! Now that is not cool. Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank. Dude! Yaaah! Alright Richard! <poem><i>Aaaaah!</i></poem> <poem><i>Aaaaah!</i></poem> <poem><i>Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...</i></poem> You guys, you guys! I can do it. <poem><i>Aaah!</i></poem> Sidney! There's too many of them. Willy! We can't stop them. Carlos! Mroo- That's stupid. Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig. Watch me plebeian. Hey dumb-asses. You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet? Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig. Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being. Good luck with your stupid little pig. Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone. Dad, you're the best. But he's our science fair project! But dad! I want a human clone. They're all stupid anyway. Come on guys, let's go. Hey, they've got our clone. He belongs to us. Daddy! Nooooo! You cheating bastards. This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow. Thank you Mr. Garrison. Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man. I present to you, the five-assed monkey. Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. Ohhh, you farted. Hey Phillip, would you like a flower? Alrighty then, here's a two-lip. You're an asshole, Phillip. Oh no, Phillip, looks like you're about to fart. Oh no. Hey Phillip, guess what? Fart. Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans. Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart. Haha, that I am! Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check? Ohho God. Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like? Well, it smells like, a dirty fart! Hey, Phillip. Is there a penny stuck in my butt? It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here. I sure am cold, Phillip. Gosh, I hope we don't starve. Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans? Huh, eh, wait wait wait. Eh, eh. Here it comes, ehhhh. Daaaah, I crapped in my pants! I spattered his face! Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter. Hey! Are you looking at my headgear? Are you looking at my headgear? You little liar. I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan! Who said that? Are you staring at my neck-brace? You'll never be bigger than me Stan. Never! What the hell do ''you'' want? Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now. It's not Stan's fault. It wasn't Stan, he was... he was with me the whole time. I will. That show's for babies, it's so stupid. Jesus! What the hell are you doing? No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?! You little jerk! You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom! Can I help you? Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs. Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in. I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering. It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses. And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose. Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish. And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard. Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'? You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days. Hmm? What? Oh, excuse me. Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please? Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it. How luscious. Our creature has come to fruition, boys. Oh my God! He only has one ass. He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room. Oh no, this entire experiment is turning out very bad. Eeegads, he's out of control. We'll have to destroy him. He's too dangerous son. Son, no. Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake. You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy. Oh thank Buddha I found you boys. You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately? No, no, I said odd. Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy... then... uhhhhh... hmmm... oh, nevermind. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch. You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free. He's terribly dangerous. His brain is identical to yours. I need you to help me find him. Boys! Boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything. No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere. Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience. I tried to play God, and I failed. All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed. Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations. Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics. Mayor, we've got a very big problem. Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving. You know, to provide food for the needy. Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off. We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short. They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil. Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously. I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef. Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see. Oh, whoops. Now tell me what you see. Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing. Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world. Sure. They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about. We need ''more'' than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers! I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen. That's not important right now. My God, what have we done? But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead. As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should- Wait, wait.  I know a way to find out. At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is. Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but... Three thousand should cover it. Oh. Never mind. All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef , or, the 1989 Denver Broncos. The test results are in this envelope. Shall I... open it? Erhum ehrum uh  The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is- Mhhh. Ahhheh. This fish is just hurting my anus. And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access... Now back to Jesus and Pals. Me bad?? Uhhh, me baad, aba-ba-chewy-chomp. Ah chewy-chewy-chomp. Uhhhyahhuhhh. Ba-ba-chomp-betchaba-chewy-chewy-chomp-aaah. its-to-the-left-mayoueyea. Ahhhh. Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp? Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran. Ahhhh, yeahhh. Me bad?? Ah. Chewy-chewy-chomp. Ahhh. Uhhh. Oh my Gooodd! Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.  Ooooh. Oohh, they're so beautiful. Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer. Hallelujah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH. Oh my God, did he...? Oh my Goooood, help meeee! It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight-year old Stan Marsh of South Park. When asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town, the little boy replies simply, "Me Stan, ba-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp. Back to you in the studio. ...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, "Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station." In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini. You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want. Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like ''this''. Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like ''this''. Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like ''this''. Alright-y then. Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.  Alrighty then, let's get started! Mr. Garrison. ''Mr. Garrison.'' The operation is over, Mr. Garrison. You look great! Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, snapped some cartilage... ...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart. By the way, did you ever see that movie ''Contact''? I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest. I'll check on you a little later. Okay, only a few more bandages to go. Take a look for yourself. Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll ''really'' notice the difference. Thanks Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body. That's all for now. Everybody in town is upset with you young man. What's going on? Are you on drugs? Oh honey, please forgive us son. Now blow out the candles grandpa. Hurray!!! Make a wish grandpa. Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake? Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you. Language. Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something? Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there. Here honey, talk to your father. We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air. Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning. You bet, you poor dears. It had a baby? Oh wow! Hmmm. You boys get first prize. <poem><i>Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear grandpa...</i></poem> <poem><i>...Happy birthday to you.</i></poem> Uhhhhh. Shoot me. I wish I were dead I'm ''not'' being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old. Uhhhhh Ah, dammit! Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya? Ok. You just have to do one thing for me. Why not? I killed my grandpa when I was your age. What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents. Ingrate! You pompous son of a whore! Uhhhh. Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet. Kill me, God dammit! Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya? Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch. That's right. And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too. Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma. That's the spirit, Tubby. I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso? Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa, please? Tug - a - little harder, Billy. Uh, ow. Dammit! I was so close. Come here Billy, I want to show you something. Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me... ...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa. Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready, Billy? Not just yet. That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa. So now will you kill me, Billy? That's good Billy, a little higher now. Does the pope crap in the woods? Uhh, cut the damn rope already! It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore. Come on, let's go. What the...? Come back here, you pompousy son of a pansy! Come over here, you son of a whore! Hey, you were supposed to kill me! That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it. Grandpa? My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard? Limbo? But I've been waiting for 25 years. I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year? No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show. Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes. I won! I won! Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart. Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. I sure would Terrance. Take that, you stupid dick. You're exactly right, Terrance. Oh. What? Oho yeah, I love beans. Well, don't fart on me, Terrance. You're such an asshole, Terrance. Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind? Oh, you farted. No Terrance, why don't you tell me? Oh, there's one. Yes, Terrance? Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check. Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony. AAAAAH! Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe! Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass. Ah, a squeaker! Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon. Aaaah. I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf. Now he's a smelly Indian. Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance. How would you like to make a dollar Billy? Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching? What is this? It's horrible! What did he say? Whatwhatwhaaat?!!? Oh really? Is that so? And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny. Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor... These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up! We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children! We want more quality television, like ''Full House''. It'll work, it has to. Hey, you will not get away with this! That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'. Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool? The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready? Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch! We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes. Here Carol, I think it's your boy. At last, now we can return to normality. Here they are! But look what they put on. What did he say? Whatwhatwhaaat!!! Come on everybody, back to New York! Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?! How ''dare'' you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?! So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea? Our family doesn't ''celebrate'' Christmas. Whatwhatwhaaat?!? ''You're'' not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!! How about the dreidel song, bubbe? Kyle, that is enough! Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison. That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community! Kyle! Sshhh! Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww. Your father's right, Kyle. Listen to your father, Kyle. This is for your own good, bubbe. OH MY GOD! Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?! Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it. What the hell is this??? This is horrible!!! Oh my God, it ''is'' you! Oh, I am such a huge fan, Ms. Streisand. I never thought I'd live to see you in person! I hate to ask this, but could I get an autograph? My sister would die. Oh thank you, Ms. Streisand! Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor! Huh huh, I had another ... Yeahh, woohoo! Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me. Hooray! Yeah, is this Jesus? Oh, sorry. Uh, this is Martin... How the hell'd you know that? Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and- Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus. Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards? Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame. Whoopeee! Death! Cool. <poem><i>'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'</i></poem> <poem><i>Bar-bura, Bar-bura!</i></poem> <poem><i>Ultura Lenardu Marutin!</i></poem> Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warsog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network. Fuck you. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there. Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked. Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Somers. Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you! 7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52. Mrrrrr! Mrrr. Mrrr. Mooorrrr! Mrrrr! Mrrrr! Mrrrr! Mrrrrr! Mrrr. Ahhh! Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah! Ahhh! Billllyyyy... That's right, Billy. I asked you to kill me, Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo. I was wrong to put you in that position, Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes. Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes... You are the one behind all these shenanigans. Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it. Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies. Aaah! Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah! Up yours, butt-munch. Vladned chaviski. Bodad comrade Dobalsted.<br />''(Propulsion systems stable... No problems with Mir...)'' Ayyy! Shtaad, boded but shtaad.<br />''(You scared me, you communist bastard)'' Shtool.<br />''(Crap)'' Graaah. Porchad. Hehe, vlided il chalfeka<br />''(Gotcha, Happy Halloween)'' Oh, shtool.<br />''(Oh...Crap)'' Let's get 'im to the morgue. You know, I think death is least funny when it happens to a child. Marty, do you have to put that stuff on everything? Well, let's let him drain. ...So then the necrophiliac says, "If this ain't a cadaver then I-" Hey! Me too! What, what is it doc? Oh no, you mean... Oh, yeah... I know what you mean. I don't know, it ju- it just makes everything taste so...English. Aaah! God damn! That little turd bit me! Oh I'm so hungry, and all I can think about eating is, eh, brains!  Very interesting. Well, your- your temperature is only 55 degrees, you have no pulse, no heartbeat, and your, your eyes are all puffy and sticky. Yeah, I'm afraid the two of you have - Pink Eye. I'd give you topical medicine, but I don't wanna touch ya. Yeah, well for God sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics. Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right? What the hell are you talking about? Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream. Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef. Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years. Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah. Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody. Ahh! Uuuhh. Ow, ooh, ow, gowuh- Must eat brains. Aaargh!!! Oh my God!!! Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef. Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel? Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh! Eric! God bless it! what do you think you're doing?! Where did you get that costume, young man?! Shhh! Oh, God bless America. You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video. Watch the video Eric. Now, do you have any questions? You must remove that costume, immediately! Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now. Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume? Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man. Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now. Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson. ''You can't care for this child!'' Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park. Because he can't! Because eight-year olds can't be parents!  I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy. I send my five dollars a month, see?  Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery. So you're going to have a ''substitute'' teacher. And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison. Yes, little boy? ...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen. Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay. That's right. Will you stay? Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died. Oh, my! What an exciting day! And just what is going on here, mister? Ms. Ellen, is this true? Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. ''Take her away!'' Oooooh. Adolf Hitler was a very, very naughty man! Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brüder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa- So remember kids, dressing like Hitler in school isn't cool! Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around. Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus. Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes. Aaah! Trick-or-treat! Trick-or-treat. Trick-or-treat. Trick-or-t-Aaah! Hey, Chef, trick- Ohh, how cute. Aaah! Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911! Call 911! Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia. I noticed! Call the National Guard! Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch. And to think I actually ''watched'' your HBO special. Oh, God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Nooo!

Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs. And now a word from our sponsor. And now, back to Part 2 of the ''Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special.'' We'll be back to part 14 of the ''Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special'', right after this. Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help. You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce. For just five dollars a month ''you'' can sponsor a child. Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift. Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support. So please, call and adopt a child today. Who the hell are you?! Nooho, this is ''my'' cake! NOO! You can't have any! Uh oh. (What are you doing? Let me off of here!) It should be something festive. Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet? Not as beautiful as you. Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys. Not as beautiful as you. Not as beautiful as- Amen! Ap-ee-tizer. Sweet. ''Yeah'', I want da Cheesy Poof. Sweet. Baba gook gook ba. Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of ''food'' are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family. Poverty stricken citizen. I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program. Grab a lot son. Come on, son! Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding. We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up. Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch. Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!! Yeaaa! We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately. A baba, gluck gluck bababab ga. Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us, and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen. God Damn-it. Amen. Does anybody have a can opener? Mayor, we are deeply offended by the Nativity scene in front of the capital office. Church and State are ''separate''! No! Wrong! Mayor, the Nativity is what Christmas is all about. If you remove Christ, you ''must'' remove Santa and Frosty and all of ''that'' garbage, too! This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!! Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian. Oof. Look! It's that guy from the public access show! When is Satan gonna show up? You're gonna ''kick his ass'', Jesus. Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck. You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted! Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus. Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now! ''Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light!'' See ya later. What the hell, does he think we're all crazy? I don't believe this! And we ''must'' put a stop to the cutting down of Christmas trees! Raah!  Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage. That's very offensive to non-Christians. Hey! Don't put your beliefs on ''me'', buddy! Change my bet! Give me a break! I'm betting on the Devil! And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids. If you don't want to spill your coffee, you shouldn't be driving with it. Is mistletoe offensive? Oh, come on! Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor! It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it! Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do! Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'. Say it! Again! Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight! What did you say?! Kyle, what are you doing in there? Open this door! KYLE! Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up! It wasn't ''our'' idea to take out Santa Claus! Get him in the ribs! Kyle. ''Kyle.'' Howwwwdy-hoooo. Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell. You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers. Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? Howdy-ho! You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold. Aw, gee, that's too bad. Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas. Howdy-ho! Golly, that isn't very nice. I'd sure like to teach him a lesson. Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!! Kyle! Howdy-ho. Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!! Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery. Howdy-ho, Chef! What's all the ruckus? I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey! STOP FIGHTING!! Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies". Howdy-ho, Kyle!!! I brought some friends with me. Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas. Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready? Here we go: Christ Hm. Okay. Cherub. Hm... Camel Hm. Sad. Stupid Wop Dago. Bench... Mayor's orders. Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay? Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia. Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle. Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle? So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya? And that must make you mad. Mad enough to ''kill'', Kyle??? Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay? Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have. Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand? To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac... Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey! No! Get away from me! No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay? Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay? Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is? Uhuh. That's a good start, why else? Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. And no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. You be passive, m'kay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like ''him'' now. ''Oh'', well, there's a news flash! Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay? Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric? Well-obviously ''something'' is bothering him.  Oh, of course! My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay? Oh, hell yes! Hhmm. Reason? Any allergies? Jacket! Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down. Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great! Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday... Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef. Thank you, Chef! And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass! As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes. How like a turtle the sun looks. All you bastards ruined Christmas! Damn tree-hugger! Whoa!! Oh my God, what the hell is ''that'' thing?

Those guys farted on me, and then called me- I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party. The other kids have always hated you? Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party. Wow. That kid has some emotional problems. Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you. I have to. My dad's always on the move.

And now, back to ''America's Stupidest Home Videos''- And now, back to ''America's Stupidest Home Videos''-  Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison? Is it Jimbo? Or is Officer Barbrady? Or could it be Ned? Or Mr. Broflovski?? Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new '''South Park''', in just four weeks. He's so gay. Yeah. Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be? Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War? Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring. In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., ''Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!''

Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery, ...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us. Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman? Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.  Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley? So you're alright? Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class? Stan, how about you? Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables. Cartman? Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication? Well, where did he leave off? Can I help you? Aand? I'mm the substitute. That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished- That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now? Fine, Chef.  Just let me do my job before I get fired. ''Wwhat?!'' Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do. Of course, Wendy. Ohhh.

Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage. Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan. And here's another present...from Wendy.  Oh. Why, it's a dead animal. Thank you, Wendy. Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now.  But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner. Are there any questions before we begin? Yes, Wendy? Good morning, children. Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too! We're like sisters! All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is- Really? Wel...sure! Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan. I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education. Excuse me? What are you talking about? Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends. Well first of all, you're eight. Oh boy. Good morning, children.  Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy? Oh, that's okay, Wendy. Well, I would love that, Wendy. Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan! Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting. It's a lie! ''Nooo!'' Principal Victoria, ''please''. NOOOO!! GET AWAY FROM ME!! UUGH!! NOOOOOOO!! Egh. This is all a mistake! This can't be happening! Pleease! For the love of God! <poem><i>I woke up very early one Sunday morn...</i></poem>  Oh, How-dy Mr. Garrison. Se-hey, honey, you look kinda differe-hent-huh. Did you get a haircut?  Call me! I'm in the book! Wo-hoo-hoo! Great party, Wendy! Anything for ''you'', sugar-pie! Great, baby, you're looking great! Okay, just a few hundred more shots and we'll be done! Hey, that's the life of a model, baby. You've got it!  Down! Down! Everybody down! So! We meet again, Ms. Ellen! I am Hakeem Korashki, of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government! She has killed thousands, and will kill again, I assure you! ''We must take her back to Iraq immediately!'' Here is a black-and-white photo of Ms. Ellen with our leader.  Her real name is Makesh Alak Makarakesh. For crimes against this country, you are hereby sentenced to be shot into the center of the sun! Shove off!! Ka fahra qetlaq humblaq!  Kuhla shaluah lakhenblaturtulah! Ah, laqeh blakatah! ...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month. Now, can anybody tell me, who left these arrowheads here? Well... yes, but I want to see if you're learning anything. Okay, I tell you what. Why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads.  How's it going, boys? Hm, let me see that.  Why, this is Anasazi writing! My God, this must be thousands of years old! ...and finally tonight, a young boy from South Park, Colorado found something very interesting during a field trip today. Here with a special report is a quadriplegic Swiss man on a pony. Thanks, Tom, the little eight year old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object. And so, the little boy will take his discovery home and perhaps donate it to science... mwell a little later. Back to you, Dave. Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby. Excuse me, sir... Leonard Maltin, yes.  I know who you are. You must listen to me, Chef. We have precious little time. Have you seen Barbra Streisand recently? Have you seen her?! Thank God. Then I'm not too late. Chef, it is of the utmost importance that you tell me where those little boys from the news report on TV are. Damn! Then we must look for them elsewhere. If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger. If you were Barbra Streisand, where would you be right now? Nono! I mean, where would she be staying? ''Where?'' Dammit man, where's your car?! Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here? Then we've got to keep looking. Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits? More than a bitch! She's a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman. When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the universe. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos. Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of '''My Fair Lady''', Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles. Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets a hold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand! Well, looks like we'll have to go to plan B. Have you ever heard of the band called, ''The Cure''? No, no. Just the lead singer.  Oh! Ah! She's close! She's very close-I can feel her. Sh-She has the boys! The, they're in trouble! Keep going this way! Hurry! Oh no! No! She has joined the two triangles? Stand back, Chef! Marutam Re! I've got to go after Mecha Streisand! Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith of The Cure at this number! Barbra! Kite, Kite. Churipu. (Come, come. Tulip!)  We must tell him that her weak point is the nose. Who is the boy I saw on the news report tonight?  Hello there, little boy. Do you know who I am? <poem><i>Ugh. I bet you do. <poem><i>-where there's lucky clovers in the f-</i></poem> I'm Barbra Streisand! So?! Uh muh, so I'm a very famous and very important individual. What?! No! Ugh. Look. Little boy, I understand that you found a neat little triangle near here, you know what I'm talking about? Well, little boy, does the triangle have a symbol of two snakes joined at the middle? Okay, now this is ''very important''. Where is the triangle of Zinthar now? I'm not talking to you, you piss-ant little hick! Where is the triangle, dammit?! Problemo? Huh, There's no problemo, Officer. I was just introducing myself to these charming little boys. ...Well?! ''You'' know who I am, don't you? Waaaaaaah! He has it, Milo. That little bastard has the triangle. I'm sure! He knew about the symbol of Krewluck! A cop showed up - he's a clever one - I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled ''very'' carefully. How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand! Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today? That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person. I hear that one of you found my triangle. Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours. But I'll ''die''. I want to give you a big cash reward for ''finding'' it. It's worth a lot of money to me. Oooh, hahahah. Who is that? ENOUGH!! Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - money - for the triangle. Eh. Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I will be the biggest, most famous person ever! You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with ''my triangle!'' Wheeere is the triangle of Zinthar?!  Maybe ''this'' will help jar your memory... NOOOW do you remember?! Alright. You asked for it! <poem><i>I'm gonna tell you now... </i></poem> <poem><i>Happiness with you is like happiness...</i></poem> Finally, the triangle is mine! After centuries of waiting, I finally have the triangle of Zinthar! Now, the Diamond of Pantheos is complete. Sugoi! Kono hi wa... atarashii hajimari da! Ima kara... atashi no namae wa... (Wow! Today is... a new beginning! From now on... my name will be...) ...Mecha... Barbura... Sutoraisando! Are you sure? Then why don't we go get it? And. Action! Cut, great, print that. Excellent work, Sid. Take five, guys, let's set up for the next shot.  Rebecca, I'm a man. A man like any other with dreams and emotions. And that's why I'll never put a foreign object up my ass. Huh? Where? Excellent! What's going on here? That's right. I'm Sidney Poitier. Barbra Streisand has found the triangle of Zinthar? Kolooh kulatchki! Hello. You must hurry! A young man has found the Triangle of Zinthar. At a small piss-ant white-bread mountain town in Colorado called South Park. ...and so, just weeks after the devastating attack of mutant genetic creatures, zombies, and Thanksgiving turkeys, the town of South Park has managed to rebuild itself, once again be- Oh, Goddammit, not again! Mayor! Barbra Streisand is- Hello? Yes, i' is. Ooooooh so Barbra Streisand's found the other triangle, eh? Am I too late? Here, you boys hold this walkie, you can help me fight her. I have to try. I can't let Barbra Streisand do this to the entire world. Can I have my walkie-talkie back now, please? Alright, I'll ro-sham-bo you for it. Ready? All right, men, give 'er everything you've got!  It's no use! Our firepower has no effect! Oh my Goooodd!  AAAAA! MECHA IKE! Yes, Eric, I would ''like'' some tea. Thank you. You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody ''likes'' you. Eric is the best! Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true. I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all. Oh, thank you, Eric.  We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea. Eric kicks ass! Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart ''and'' true. Everybody likes you very much. Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome. Meow. Meow. Hhhhhcck! Meow. 1 1 1 1 1 <poem><i>There you are, like a throbbing star.

Oh boy, I was worried there for a second.  Look, kid, I'm ''not'' your father. Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.' She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.' Your mom's a slut. Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you. We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot. I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things. He's the last person I saw with your mom that night. Running Water, there is some kid here to see you. He claims to be ''your'' kid. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ! 1 1 I haven't. Oh. Yeah. Oh, I'm a little dog.
