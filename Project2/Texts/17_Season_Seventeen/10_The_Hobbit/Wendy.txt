Cheer Squad roll call!  You guys, stop it! Okay, Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay? What? See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay? But, Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him? Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!  What the fuck is your problem?! Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?! Yeah! Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl! She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade! What?!  This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves! Look it up, stupid!   Oh, good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good! ...Are you serious? That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian! Right, but she's not in real life. She's a hobbit. I'm not "jel", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school! Butters. Butters, come here for a sec. Butters, will you please let me show you something, so we can put this behind us? I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right? Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides , and, there.'' Do you see what I'm talking about? That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere. What? What do you mean? Butters! Excuse me! Why would I be jel? She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point! Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly!   I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa. I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way! Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that- Jelly school? Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make. Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes. Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change. Cheer Squad roll call!  And I'm your captain, Wendy!  I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry! Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem!   What? So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?! Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs. Yeah.  Oh God damn it! Ugh!  Wendy. Let's just get back to cheering, okay?! See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!  Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it. ...Nooo.  Not lately, no. NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images! That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts! That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me! Agh! What do you want? Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly. No no, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
