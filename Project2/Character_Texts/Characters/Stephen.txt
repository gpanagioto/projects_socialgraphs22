Where... where am I? 
Well how gay is he? 
Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry. 
Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces? Alright, you can take the paper bag off. Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?! Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious! Put that bag back on! 
Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth! Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister! Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!  Uh, do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded! Jacking it? Jacking what? WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?! Oh, you're gonna get it, mister! Just wait until I get home! Don't you "Hi, Mom and Dad" us, you little punk!!!  You think you're tough now!!? Answer me!!!  
Yeah. We figure that if our boys are gonna be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too. Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has ''your'' sons to be his best buddies! And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend. No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation. Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting! Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend! Here we are, everyone.  Where are Butters and Eric? Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder!  Okay.  We'll meet you boys on the slopes.  It sure is.  What's the red sticker? O-all right! Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company? Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo! Hey look, this chair lift goes right into a building.  I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ''...did...'' just say a thirty-minute presentation. Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office. What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing?  
Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke! Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!  Butters! 
 Butters, this is your father. Butters? Answer me! Butters! Right now! WHAT?!  What's gotten into them? I'll say! That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  maybe we can grab some burgers. 
 
Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth. Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!  ...Same thing. 
Us? Your family's always been the shifty-eyed ones!  Oh, son, can you ever forgive us? Oh.  Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah. 
Oh, hello boys. Well, thank you very much, kind heroes. Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough.  Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: ''The Lord of the Rings''. That's our man. Here you go.  Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon. What's the matter? Butters? Butters, where is the movie you were watching? ''Backdoor Sluts 9'' makes ''Crotch Capers 3'' look like ''Naughty Nurses 2''! Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time. The video stockyard. Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?  Wait a minute. Where's Butters? 
Uh huh. Dumbass! Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right? Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to! Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn. Come on, let's go.  
What the hell is this?!  Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?! What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son. Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib. We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son!  
Well well well! I had to see it to believe it!  Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again! Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady. And that's your excuse?! Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber! 
O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago.   Girlfriend? Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.  You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay. I, don't know. Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money. Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside? You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession. 
 It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over. 
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson? I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance. 
I think it's best we try to reason with it. 
Butters?  Butters, what is wrong with you?? Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now! Butters, play!  Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life. What happened to him, Doctor? Now, honey, we were trying to read.  
 Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division!  You're out.  Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs. I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough! Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game!  Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball! Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming. Keep running, kid!  
Who's seeing dead people? Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts. Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you. Yeess. That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS. That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years. So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS. Butters, what is going on?! Well you'd better stop having nightmares or else you're gonna be grounded! Butters! What have you done?! No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him. Now do you believe us, Butters?  Butters?! 
 
Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!  This is all your fault, Jimbo! Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?! Jesus.  Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone! Let me go too. I can't go on! Feel so... hot. 
Yes? What is it, officer?  Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks. Linda? Linda, please come downstairs.  Who are you? Bring him back? W-What are you talking about? Indian... Burial Ground? You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I- Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again.  Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back! I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore! Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I! It's him.  It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me. Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?! Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son.  Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination. Yes, it must feed.  Oh yes, thank you for coming. Just follow me to the basement.  Here you go, son. Eat! Come on. Don't watch it eat.  
Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski. Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town!  
We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him! No, no, wait a minute,  
Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?! You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now! Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!  ...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel? 
Hehey!  
Butters! Butters! What are you doing?! Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this!   Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this? Don't ''lie to me, Butters!'' I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious. You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters.  Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious. You see? What can I do, Father? A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.  Thank you so much for taking him in. There you are, Butters! What's he done now?! Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change. Well you know somethin'? So do I.  
And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere. What happened? No. All the phone lines are completely down.  We can't just leave them out there. This isn't happening! Ask her what's happening. I knew they'd come back for us! Why are they turning? They're... they're leading them away! 
Oh, hey Randy. I've never heard of one that big. Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history! But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!  Hey. Hey that's right. Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken! That's great, Randy! 
We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling. 
 Butters, time for breakfast.  Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you. You ''are'' in Imaginationland. ''This'' is a dream. 
 Well good for you, Butters. Well, guess we don't have to ground him. 
 Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!   Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald. 
 What is it, dear? A penis? Now darling, calm down. Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises.  Oh, it's just a little penis, darling. Your teacher's penis? Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like? Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out. 
Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working? Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report. It could come back. Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya? 
 
Oh God look! Get off the roof!  Look, I, I think we need to find a way out under the city. There's something over there! 
Oh, shut up!  It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead. Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu...  Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark.  I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone! I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya! All right, damn you! The children can come in! It's still here, ih... it's all still here. No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right. 
You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?! I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go! What keeps a family together, Butters?! That's right!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right! You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?! There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?!  Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister!  That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?! All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah! Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now! Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  Uhh, Bu-Butters? AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!  All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!  He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground. What? That's right son. There's only one thing I care about. Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?! Butters, you are grounded! It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more.  
 It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house! The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills. Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us. There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit. He's... paying for everyone's debts.  
Butters? A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil. 
Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see. What are you, Peterson? A gay fish?  
Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone. Can you believe it? Huh? 
There you are, Butters! Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend?  Sally Darson? 
John Lennon's dead, Butters. Really amazing. Hello Matt Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented. Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course. But we are very very proud nonetheless. Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded! 
We don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed, and now it's now OKAY to show Muhammad. 
 Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?! And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it! Aaagh! Get it off of me! Shoot it!  Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy? 
That's my son. Is there a problem, officer? What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded! Don't talk back to me!  Go up to your room, now!  Butters started an Asian turf war! I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda. Well, Dr. Janus? Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him? Oh God the medication isn't working! Butters! Butters!!  '''''Butterrrrs!!!''''' You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you, son! You're going to be okay, Butters! You hear me?! '''''You are going to be okay!!!'''''  
What was the show about? Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are. 
I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat? 
Well, speak of the devil. Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea. Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork.  What's the matter, Butters? Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham. I'll get it.  Your friends wanted to see you, Butters. 
Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night. All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it. And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to "Oh, why don't we just drink each other's cum?"! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?! We'll talk about that when you're older.  What? Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend. 
How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who ''clearly'' has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything! Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: ''I'' had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with ''me'' now. I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell. Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you. You should have never come to our town!  What?! How? Son of a bitch, it's him all right! He's stopping at another house.  Yes, we found that in his pocket.  
Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?! Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?! Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua. Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault. It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids. You probably think Butters seems somehow... different. It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place. Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing. It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do! You know that's not allowed! Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa. No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.  Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called "hapahui apahoha", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  
Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?! Well? Any luck? No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock? We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price. I'll never give up!  I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone! Aw, go to hell, you griefer! 
 Hurry! You gotta go! Get out! You're not safe! Hurry! You gotta go! 
 Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys. Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way. No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up. Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here. Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad.  Download the app! It works great!  Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila. You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  Timmy! The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald. Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps! Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.  
 Butters? Butters, are you home?? What are you talkin' about? Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct. I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you. There, you see? It's right there.  I swear I didn't fly it. Butters? Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage? Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you. Yes, I'd like to return this drone.  Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore. Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it...  flies by itself.  The battery was half empty. Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about. You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything. No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision.   Randy. We need to talk. Inside.  Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast ''didn't recall doing''. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts? I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them. Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy?? If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby. Please do not adjust your televisions! My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us! Time to end this hobby once and for all!  No! NOOOO! We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "No more!" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away.  
There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?! I know that! What do you-? Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh! What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer! Oh no, mister. You are GROUNDED!  Butters?! Who is that?!  Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember ''why'' Butters is grounded? What, what did he do? It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he ''is'' grounded.  And no bouncing the racquetball either!  Butters! What are your friends doing here?! You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?! Well, you're getting it now! Oh my gosh! Linda! It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore. No. I've I've got to tell him!  You can go outside and play, son. No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over. 
I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it? 
Huh for what?! Oh, Caitlyn Jenner. she's a hero. She is stunning and brave. No! Caitlyn Jenner is the bravest woman in America. What in the world is going on?? 
We couldn't get a Whole Foods to open here. No, nothing. And we we wanna try everything!  
Butters! What are you doing?! Randy, Randy, we've got a problem. Reality's here. He's trying to crash the party. 
Thomas! I'm so glad that Craig is finally happy.  
 It's ISIS! They're these troubled kids who've turned their backs on America! They've taken over SoDoSoPa, forced all the homeless out! They're just bad kids! Rotten on the inside! Probably with shitty parents! I'm pretty sure the police will help out if it's because ISIS is taking over the town.  Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS. We don't know who they are, but they-. That is not true! Who said that? Look, Barbrady, the fact is, the town needs you. 
Wow.  Linda! I had to get away from the ads. I felt like the ads were... evolving somehow. They started knowing what I liked. What I was afraid of. I tried ad blockers, but it seemed like every time I tried to block the ads, they just got smarter. I'm never going back from Super School News. 
I will. 
Maybe from now on people in this town need to communicate more! Care about each other! 
Oh my god, that was great.  Randy, you gotta calm down. Look, maybe you need some supplements to help calm your nerves. Have you heard of member berries? It's a new superfruit that helps you mellow out and relax. The guys at work told me about them. Been taking them about six months now. I'll telling you, they really take the edge off. 
	Some are. A lot of people like what he has to say, alright? More than ever. Don't you get it, Randy? There's people in this country who are sick and tired. Tired of hearing all the rhetoric. Tired of Washington failing us while they pat their own backs. Finally someone comes along and says what he feels. That's why people like him. You can say what you want, at least he doesn't sound like another politician.  What? Are you out of your fuckin' mind? You wanna vote for that douche?! He'll ruin this country! Yeah, but not anymore! I don't know. You just did. I don't know. Nobody knows what to think anymore. I'm just tired of thinkin' about it. Come on, let's relax and' have some member berry pie. 
Gerald, come on. The first step towards healing is admitting you've got a problem. 
Oh my gosh! Honey, it's the nearly-Gentleman! Well of course, that's very gentlemanly of you.  Oh. Well, I'm afraid Butters is grounded for pressing pickle at the nail salon again. Uh but, but of course we'll make an exception.  That'd be great. No matter how hard we ground him, he remains defiant.  Butters, stop smooshing snake! The gentleman is here to speak with you. 
 Mr. President. 
And what are the police gonna do to make sure people don't use it?! I know I'll certainly respect others' privacy, but about other people like  Laura Tucker the Blabbermouth? The President? He won't listen to us. He hates us now. 
 Butters, you're not looking at boobies again, are you? You know what I think the problem is? Facebook. Well, look, we all know there's a lot of mixing of truth and fiction that's been on Facebook lately, and children lack the cognitive ability to determine what's true and what isn't on Facebook. That's why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes, eating poop, and having sex with antelopes in our town. Why not give it a try? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg here and see what he has to say? I'm sure he's a reasonable person.  What, eh. Excuse me, this is our car?! Get, get out of here, ya penis. You have to do something! This guy's goin' around acting like everyone's stuff is his! Please, you don't understand! He-h he's such a penis! Butters! You're the one who started all this?! You think you're just so smart, don't you?! Make me look like a fool, will you?! We'll just see about this! Not so funny now, is it?! Go on! Tell Mr. Putin what you told me! Didn't break any rules?! Good job teaching our children that's all that matters! Just because there's a way to cause chaos in a town, or disrupt an entire country, doesn't mean you go and do it, does it?! If Mark Zuckerberg points a loaded cannon at someone's face,  are you innocent for just lighting the fuse?! Answer me! No! You don't go around making things up about people either! Unless it's about Mark Zuckerberg, because he deserves it!  
Almost thought you guys were gonna bail on us.  Okay, Chip. You might need to ease up on that crack there, buddy.   Randy, can I talk to you? I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives. I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first. Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming? I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience. Yeah, sure.  I'm sorry. Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about? Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for? What? What uh, What are you doing? Nooo!  Oh my God! I see what this is! This witch pursuit thing has you on a witch pursuit thing now!  I'm innocent. Please! Noho, don't you see?! They're just doing their own witch pursuit thingy now! This is madness!  "What's up, bros?" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused? 
Well, you know, Sharon, I think... its a complex issue, you know. It's... it's not really as simple as just...  Red?  It's all right, Randy. Well, Randy, have you stopped to think that maybe this problem is bigger than Sharon's period? I mean that maybe what's going on really is a big deal. What if this is actually... menopause? Randy was just trying to make you feel loved while you're going through menopause. How do you know? Yeah, let's go somewhere without so much negativity.  
 Morning, guys. And a Catholic priest raped him.  Oh that was Linda! Hey Randy, what's up?  But where would priests go this late at night? She said, "To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us." Sure, she doesn't care. Well yeah, we got a really weird text from him saying not to worry, he needed to do some camping. 
Well that's ridiculous! We, we can't all buy that much candy! Let's just get rid of those scooters! Heh hey Randy. Linda and I, we... we were talkin' about how we never see you guys anymore, and we were thinking we'd hang out with you for Halloween, heh. Well, that, and we really wanna hang with you guys. Then please, Randy, can we just borrow a little candy? Please, Randy, the stores are all out! Just a few Milky Ways to get us through the first couple hours, please! We can cut 'em up. We can- we can hand them out little pieces at a time. It's okay, Linda! It's okay! On Halloween night, I'll... I'll just one of those e-scooters myself. I'll go around and, and I'll trick-or-treat. I'll... I'll get a bunch of-  I'll get a bunch of candy, Linda, and I'll bring it back to our house for us to hand out! It's going to be okay.  Trick or treat! Happy Halloween! Trick or Treat! That's not true! Yes I do! I'm Megyn Kelly! Now trick or treat! 
 
  I'm sorry. It's just this new job. It can be such a grind.  Kids these days just don't understand how much their parents break their back to provide.  Goodbye, Linda. So this is where all the main boxing and transferring happens. I'm excited to have you guys working here at the fulfillment center, Mr. and Mrs. Tweek. Yeah, people are ordering everything online these days. That's why you'll find a lot of familiar faces working here.  Everything's automated and timed to precision to get people's orders out to them as soon as possible. This is Josh, he'll be your section manager. In these warehouses, there are over one million items, from toothpaste to Go Karts, and it's the work of both humans and machines that make the work possible.  Josh!  Whenever there's a workplace accident, you need to fill out a 1081 form.   Can I have a beer, please? Whatcha got on tap? Gimme Amazon Light. I'm a Prime member.  Yeah, well, we should be thankful we even have jobs, huh? Before the fulfillment center opened, we really didn't have anything.  Okay, hold on, everyone. I'm sure there's an explanation. Hold on, guys.  M-My son has a big bike parade coming up. I... I can't just not show up to work now. A bike parade.  There's no easy way to say this, so I'll... just come out with is then. We're... not Amazon Prime members anymore.  Everyone involved in the strike has been dropped down one level from Prime. We're... we're now Amazon USDA Choice.  Please... I don't know what else to do. My family is all that matters to me.  What if they just get others to do all the boxing for us?  My family has to come first.  Don't you understand? It's not about me! It's my son! He's just a kid! He wants to be in the bike parade!  
Welcome to the fulfillment center. I'm your floor manager, Stephen Stotch.  Sure it is. You just gotta get into it, okay? That's one order down, we have  What the--? I don't understand. I guess I did. The bigwigs promoted me to manager. I'm been training new employees.  When did all this stuff arrive?  Yeah, it's not always easy being a fulfiller, but I think, eventually, you'll find it's a rewarding job.  What do you want, Stuart? What are you talking about? No it isn't, Butters. I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to join my friends in striking but... I know that you have to have your stuff to be happy.  What?  Sure are, Butters. 
Oh, hey, Randy. Good. How's life in the Valley been treatin' ya? Oh... yeah, no , I... actually... hadn't ordered any in a while. No. Well... here, let me show you.  I started growing my own plants a couple of weeks ago. I totally get it. It's a really fun hobby. That's Diego, my gardener. What? No, I just started kinda getting into it. I just enjoy the whole- Come on, growing marijuana is not your idea. This is inhumane! Diego is my gardener! Who called you people?! It was Randy Marsh, wasn't it?! Oh yeah, I'm growin' my own weed. I'll grow my own weed. Hey, I think I'll just grow my own weed.  I'll grow my own weed. My own weed. I'll grow my own weed. I'll grow my own weed. 
Hoh, there's our Butters. 
It's not safe for our kids to be in this school! You do understand that up to 5% of kids with vaccines can still be at risk! Everyone has to do it, or it doesn't matter! Aw, come on, Mrs. Cartman! All major medical organizations state that vaccines are safe! The CDC, the FDA, UNICEF, and the US Department of Health! Of, of course you care. Nobody likes seeing their child in pain. Maybe... maybe you should just let us take care of getting Eric his shots. We'll find a way to make it completely painless for him, okay? Alright, alright. Bring him in.  The little boy's room is upstairs. Look, by the time he knows what's happened it'll already be over. Yes, yes. Come on, Thomas and Laura!   Thomas! Linda! Yo-you gotta get him!  I think the only way we're goin' to get Eric immunized is by bringing in an expert. Well, what happened? You said you could catch him! Barbecue? Whoa whoa, Mrs. Cartman. Everything is fine here.  
 Find anything good, Butters/ Well, did you all enjoy the museum, gang? Well I'm pretty sure we saw the whole exhibit. Alright, Archeologist Butters, but then meet us back right here. 
Oh. Well, finally! The cable company gave us a window from noon to 5 for you to show up, It's 5:15. This is why we should quit cable and just go to streaming services.  Yeah, I think I do. Aha, I don't even know who to call, uh. Here, let me try something.  
Yeah! Let's drive!   Mornin', Jim. Mornin', Kate. You really tied one one last night, huh? Happy holidays.  The fuck is this? But this is ridiculous.  Manager? Manager! Manager, there's a chain and sign blocking our way into the liquor aisle. What? Who has that kind of power? We drank it all before driving to the tree-lighting ceremony! Hey, woah woah woah, wait! Hold on!  I've got family coming over, from out of town! You can't expect me to be sober!  Skeeter! Thank God you're still open. I've me a Cabernet, huh? And a couple of bottles to take home. Oh what's the point, Jimbo? What's the point in driving now? We all do, Randy. You a-you're not gonna let a little cold weather stand in your way. Tegridy Farms is about community. I hate the holidays.  Oh wow, this smells great! Well, what are we waiting for, everyone? Let's do some driving!  And it's gonna be the best Christmas ever!  The hell is...? Did you do all my marijuana-free Christmas snow? What are you talking about? No!  Clearly you did! Thomas, we were just wondering if we could borrow a little Christmas Snow. You're darn tootin' we do! Well, only one thing left to do, gang. Let's go driving! 
Butters, for the last time, you can't go to Build-A-Bear! Yes, they're open, but we are not the Johnsons, and we do not go to nonessential businesses when it's nonessential!  What the? What's going on now?! Well are we protesting or are we rioting? Stay here, Butters.  Yeah, what happens when my son is sitting in a room with Craig Tucker, whose father doesn't even wear a mask outside? Well, it's really not a mask if you wear it down around your chin. That's a chin diaper. Spoken like a true redneck! What new teachers? Are you out of your mind? You expect people to wear a diaper over their nose? That's disgusting! Fuck you, Fauci!  Butters?! Butters, you get back to quarantine or you are gonna be grounded! I'm not wearing a damn diaper over my nose! Yeah, we care way more about what's right than you do, bitch!  It's the pangolin. So, so what happens now? 
Kommunity Kidz, please! If you just give me a shot, why I could be somebody! I could go out to fancy restaurants like all them old people. And eat shrimp as big as my head! Yeah! You're alright, Garrison!  Adults are all vaccinated! Adults are all vaccinated! 
Don't wave at us, Butters!  Judges hate when they wave. He needs to not do that. Come on, Butters. Come on!  We should just pull Butters out of dressage. He sucks at this. Don't you understand, Linda? I'm scared. The big competition is this weekend. Butters will be going up against the Russians.  Boo, Russia! Boooo!  Don't you know who that is? That's Dan Solokov's kid! Dan Solokov? Who works at the Ace Hardware over in Meeker? Even the kid's pony is a Russian Etruscan!  You piece-a-shit communist! You won't take our freedoms away! Boo, Russia! Alright, Butters, you've just got two more days before the dressage competition. You're gonna have to do better than that, Butters. You see that little Russian kid over there?  That kid doesn't give a shit about you. He just wants to win and take what little patriotism our country has left. You didn't live through the Cold War, Butters, but we did. This tournament is going to be turned into a political spectacle, and we have to win. Otherwise, I'm afraid we'll have to give your pony away to communists who slaughter ponies and donkeys to make skin cream. That's mostly the Chinese, but a commie's a commie. Now, that little prick is trying to intimidate you. I want you to go in there and show him how an American rides! Butters! Butters, what the hell are you doing?! You have to learn to control! Butters, what the hell is that?!  Jesus, Linda, what are we gonna do? What are you doing here? Mr. Mackey? What the hell are you doing here?! I'll ask the questions, I've got the gun! Shut up, Linda! What kind of problems? So, you want them to win, huh? You're a traitor! Yeah, right...since when do you care about dressage?! Mr. Mackey... we were just here to try and give that pony diarrhea by feeding it Erewhon. We're on your side.  Oooh, no! No! We're all dead, Linda. What's he doing?! He's fighting for democracy! Go, Butters! He's got 'em! Mackey, we did it! 
Ha ha... I've got a green tie on, you little rascal!
