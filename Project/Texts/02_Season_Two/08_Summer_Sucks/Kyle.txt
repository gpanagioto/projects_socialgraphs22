What do you mean? I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year. Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat. We wanna buy M-80s. What a baby. What do ya mean? Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s? Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives. Yeah, now what are we supposed to do? Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks. Yeah! Let's go, dude. We're ready. Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled! Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands. <poem><i>Dusty the dirtball...</i></poem> Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison. Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet? Yup. Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.  Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics. Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always. Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it. I heard you won't even get in the deep end.  Dude! That thing is huge! Kenny! Watch out! You bastard! What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon! What'd he say? How is that gonna help? A lot, I think. I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. We're bored. Wow! These are huge! Hey, look! It's snowing! Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
