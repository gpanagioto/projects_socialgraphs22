Tegridy Farms, day. The farm is decked out for Halloween. In the living room, Randy brings out more Halloween decorations. Sharon is working on her laptop, Stan is busy on his phone

Randy

[dances in with a Jack O'Lantern] It's the most wonderful time of the year. [puts it on the table] Well? You all excited, gang?

Stan

For Halloween? I guess so.

Randy

Ugh, this isn't any Halloween, because this week, Tegridy Weed is doing a Halloween special. It's big promotional thing. Everyone's gonna love it. Hey, wuh-where's Shelly?

Sharon

Shelly hasn't come out of her room in two days.

Randy

Why?

Sharon

[angrily] You know why, Randy.

Randy

[Sighs] Yeah. Yeah. [Sharon glances at him]

-----


Shelly's room, later. Her door is open, and Randy walks in

Randy

Hey, Shelly? Can I talk to you for a minute?

Shelly

What do you want?

Randy

Come on, kiddo. [sits on her bed and motions for her to sit next to him] Come talk with your old man, huh? Come on now. [Shelly leaves her desk to sit on the bed] Shelly, we need to talk about your marijuana problem. You know, what's your problem with it?

Shelly

I hate marijuana!

Randy

Yes, we all know, but ugh, why?

Shelly

It stinks, and it makes everyone in this town dumber than they already are!

Randy

Shelly, the truth is, some of the most important people in the world smoke weed. Did you know that Snoop Dogg smokes weed?

Shelly

Yes, everyone knows Snoop Dogg is a stupid pothead!

Randy

Ugh, way more people enjoy marijuana than you think, okay? Okay, who's your idol? Who do you most look up to in the whole world?

Shelly

Serena Williams

Randy

Total stoner. High as a kite. Every tennis match.

Shelly

No she's not!

Randy

You don't know that, Shelly! Now you're just making assumptions!

Shelly

Everyone in this country is getting dumber, and I wish Marijuana was illegal again!

Randy

[gasps and stands up] Shelly! [begins to pace the room] Okay, loook. The thing is, this problem you're having with marijuana? It's just got to stop, okay? We're working on out Tegridy Farms Halloween Special, okay?? Nobody wants a giant bummer ruining it! I love you! [leaves and closes the door]

-----


The Egyptian Artifact exhibit at the Denver Museum, day. A shadow appears, followed by the person casting it: Butters

Butters

[looks around] Whoa. Very impressive. [strokes his chin] Indeed. [walks up to a plaque and reads it with a loupe]

Stephen

[lookin gon with Linda] Find anything good, Butters/

Butters

One minute, Dad! Archeologist Butters just needs to get his stamp and sticker for his autograph book. [gets a sticker of Baster and a stamp] Aha! another rare find!

Stephen

Well, did you all enjoy the museum, gang?

Butters

Well wait wait, we can't leave yet! I got all the stickers and tamps except for one!

Stephen

Well I'm pretty sure we saw the whole exhibit.

Butters

Can I just check around one last time?

Stephen

Alright, Archeologist Butters, but then meet us back right here.

Butters

Well o-kay!

-----


An Egyptian funeral ship. A guide is explaining its varioys aspects

Guide

What you're seeing here are original knots which were joined in the main pieces of the Khufu boat. The cedar timbers of the boat's hull were lashed together with hemp rope, a technique used until-

Randy

Whoa! Whoa! Wait just one second! Are you actually saying that hemp, a classification of cannabis [Shelly looks at him], was actually used by he ancient Egyptians? [strikes a pondering pose]

Guide

Well yes. In fact, it's been found that cannabis was used by Egyptians for its medical properties as well.

Randy

Hold the freaking phone! You're telling us that marijuana has been used throughout the centuries-?

Shelly

Is this why you brought me here?

Randy

No, I d-, I'm just, I'm surprised that-

Shelly

You said you wanted a special day with just your daughter. You said a father-daughter day at the museum could help us connect.

Randy

And, and it is, Shelly. We're havin' a great time!

Shelly

I don't care if Egyptians used stupid pot! [runs off in anger]

Randy

[noticing the stares, stands up] She has a marijuana problem. Shelly! [runs after her]

-----


The Egyptian Artifact exhibit, at the same time. Butters retraces his steps

Butters

Been there... Saw that... Where's that stupid last sticker stamp? [sees a hallway he missed earlier] What's this? [he sees something ahead of him that excites him and runs to it. The sarcophagus of Took-tan Ra]

Butters

Whoa... [gets to the exhibit and reads through his loupe] "Sarcophagus and mummified remains of Egyptian royalty." This is it! My last sticker! [gets ready to stamp his sticker book...]

Jud

[interrupting] That's the mummy of Took-tan Ra. You don't wanna put that stamp in your sticker book. Nobody puts that stamp in their sticker book.

Butters

But this is my last one!

Jud

It's got a curse on it. Ancient love cure not fit for any child. You can look at the mummy all you like, but... you don't want that stamp... in your sticker book.

Butters

[looks at his sticker book] Haha, that's okay. I'm no ordinary child. I am Archeologist Butters! [stamps his sticker book and runs off happily. He doesn't notice the brief glow the stamp gives off] Happy Halloween, Mister!

Jud

[watching him go] For some of us, maybe.

-----


Tegridy Farms, day. In the barn, Randy paces back and forth while talking to Towelie.

Randy

It's just so hard being a parent sometimes, you know? I've tried everything to get through to my daughter. I took her to a laser show, I played her all of Dark Side Of The Moon, but... it's like... it's like there's something in her head that just doesn't get it!

Towelie

That's awful, Randy. I'm sorry.

Randy

It's just- I have to live my life, you know? I can't let her problems with marijuana drag me down anymore.

Towelie

No, you're right You're totally right.

Randy

So, anyway, hey. How's the Halloween Special comin' along?

Towelie

The Halloween Special? Oh it's ready.

Randy

It's ready?

Towelie

Yeah, it's right over here. [shows Randy the way to the new plants]

Randy

O-ho wow! The Halloween Special! I'm so excited to try it.

Towelie

Yeah, it's basically a hybrid of our Tegridy Gold and Colorado Kush. Turned out really great, I think.

Randy

[inhales the aroma] Oh, wow, that is nice! I'd like to see anyone compete with this Halloween Special.

-----


Butters' house, night. He's asleep in his bedroom, on his right side. He flips over to his left side, and the stamp begins to glow. Something goes thump and Butters sits up, wide awake. He hears a knock

Butters

M-Mon? [two knocks] ...Dad? [the door bursts open and a mummy walks in. Butters screams as the mummy trashes the room. The mummy then grabs Butters... and hugs him. Butters calms down] A little... Why. Oh. Okay. Oh. Okay. Okay. Oh that's okay. [softly] That's okay. There you go. [the mummy lets go and sits on the bed next to him, presenting him with a gift] Form, for me? Oh, thank you. [takes the gift and opens it] Oh wow! A Fitbit! [the mummy murmurs something] Why thank you. Thank you. I... actually already have a Fitbit, but I could-

Mummy

Huh?!

Butters

I could give this one to a friend. [the mummy growls and stands up angrily] I just... I have one, so... [the mummy goes into a rage and finishes trashing the room, then just turns around and leaves]

-----


Tegridy Farms, kitchen, night. Shelly is cooking up a strange brew on a hot plate in her room.

Shelly

Furniture polish, paint thinner and bleach.Ammonia and antifreeze. One tablespoon each.I hate everybody, I just like to read.Everyone's stupid. They smoke too much weed.So with this eldritch potion and these ancient wordsI make my revenge upon all the turds.[she adds a lot more bleach and continues to stir]

-----


Butters' house, day. He's eating Frankenberry cereal breakfast in the kitchen when he hears two knocks and gets alarmed. He leaves the kitchen to go to the front door. He opens the door and two officers stand outside

Officer Brown

Butters Stotch?

Butters

Yes sir?

Officer Brown

We want to ask you some questions about what happened in town last night.

Butters

what... happened in town?

Officer

People were attacked by an ancient Egyptian mummy. It killed five people and destroyed everything it could.

Butters

[nervous] Oh, uh, a mummy, huh? That's, that's weird.

Officer Brown

Oh, you just think that's weird? Because the mummy said you two got in some kind of altercation last night.

Butters

What?? The mummy talked to you??

Officer

Is it true, sir, that you and the mummy [reads his report] "got into an argument over a gift you didn't seem to appreciate"?

Butters

There was no argument. I just said I already had it and I'd give it to a friend.

Officer Brown

A present that the mummy got for you?

Butters

I, I just goh-

Officer Brown

You can see how that could be pretty hurtful.

Officer

Did you throw the mummy out of your house?

Butters

No! I didn't throw the mummy out of the house! The mummy got all pissed off at me and left! [the officers look at each other, and Brown whips out his own notepad and starts writing]

Officer Brown

You're gonna have to share in the damages here, son.

Butters

But I didn't do anything wrong! Okay, look officers, I think [cups his hands together nervously] I'm under some kind of curse.

Officer

Well that's what the mummy told us about you.

Officer Brown

You got a summons to appear in court. Until then I just suggest you and the mummy stay away from each other. [rips out the ticket citation and plants it on Butters' forehead]

-----


Tegridy Farms, barn, day. Randy and Towelie are sampling their newest hybrid.

Randy

Oh, man, I really like it.

Towelie

Yeah, it's smooth.

Randy

It's really smooth. This is so good that we shold stop smoking it right now. We don't want to ruin our Halloween experience, you know? [Shelly walks in with her eldritch potion, unseen] This is seriously gonna be the best Halloween ever. [she chucks the potion all over the Halloween Special, causing Randy and Towelie to turn to see what happened. Many of the plants suffer chemical burns. Randy gets alarmed] AAAAAAA! Shelly!

Shelly

That's what I think of your stupid special! [walks away and Randy races for the plants]

Randy

No! Nooo!!

-----


South Park Elementary gymnasium, day. Mr. Mackey has another assembly, this time over appropriate halloween costumes.

PC Principal

Alright everyone, listen up. Halloween has almost arrived and I wanna make sure that we are all aware of certain guidelines when it comes to Halloween costumes at school. Now, I don't wanna see any FUCKING SOMBREROS! Alright, if I see any fucking Mexican sombreros, or anyone fucking dressed like a fucking Native American, I'm gonna lose my fuckin' shit! There will be no hobos, or bums, anything depicting people from low-income households.

Cartman

Ahp, no Halloween for you, Kenny.

PC Principal

And lastly, heed my fuckin' words. If I see any of you girls dressed as fucking Moana, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind! Alright now, the student book fair is coming up next week. We encourage all students to be able to- [crasing sounds herald the mummy's arrival. It crashes through the double doors and stomps across the floor. The students flee in all directions. The mummy grabs students at random and throws them all over the place]

-----


South Park Elementary, Counselor's Office, moments later. Butters faces Mr. Mackey.

Butters

...and that's all that happened. I put that stamp in the sticker book, and now this mummy is destroying everything around me. I need help.

Mr. Mackey

Okay. An-and do you feel like maybe the mummy is trying to, you know, get you to react?

Butters

Wuh-what, what do you mean?

Mr. Mackey

Well, you know, Butters, the mummy feels like you get to do whatever you want, but it doesn't get to do whatever it wants.

Butters

Wait. The mummy talked to you, too?

Mr. Mackey

Yeah, yeah, we had a good talk, yeah.

Butters

Why is it talking to everyone?!

Mr. Mackey

I think the mummy is very insightful and cares about you a lot.

Butters

No it doesn't! This is crazy!

Mr. Mackey

Look, the mummy's just sad because you get to go to school and have fun, and what does the mummy get to do? You know, it just sits around being a mummy. You know, that's not fair.

Butters

First of all, I don't have fun at school! And secondly... the mummy can do whatever it wants; I don't care!

Mr. Mackey

Right, but you do care, Butters, because you're sitting in my office talking all about the bad things that the mummy does.

-----


Tegridy Farms, day. Randy sits in his wooden swing and looks at one of the tickets he had made for his Halloween Special weed. He sighs.

Towelie

[appears in the yard behind him] Randy, quick! You gotta come see!

Randy

I just need some time, okay, Towelie?

Towelie

Look! You don't understand! The special! Well, it's a miracle! [leaves. Randy gets up to follow him] Come on! You're not gonna believe it! [they head for the barn]

-----


The barn. They step inside

Randy

Alright, Towelie, what is this ab-? Whoa! [the Halloween Special has overgrown and taken root all over the barn] The Halloween Special!

Towelie

Whatever your daughter threw on this shit made it more powerful than ever!

Randy

[jumps for joy] Yeah! We're back!

Towelie

Yeah!

Randy

Yeah! Yeah!

-----


A restaurant, day. Butters is enjoying drinks with the main four and Tolkien.

Butters

I have to end this curse, fellas. It's getting worse every day. Last night the mummy attacked my parents, and it said I was being narcissistic. It has no reason. No logic! One minute it's destroying everything, and the next it's sending me selfies like nothing ever happened. Look! [sure enough, there are several selfies of the mummy - in a park, in bed, working out - on his phone] This whole thing is so crazy it's starting to make me think I'm crazy!

Stan

Well, it is a little crazy how much you talk about the mummy.

Butters

[jaw drops, then] It's a freaking mummy! Wouldn't you talk about it?!

Kyle

We're just saying, Butters, that sometimes it all seems a little codependent.

Cartman

Yeah, like you and the mummy need to do your own things sometimes.

Butters

I would love that, but I don't have a choice! I swear, you guys. Mummies can smell fun! Whenever I'm somewhere, and I actually start havin' a good time, I get a call or a text from the mummy sayin' "Hey, what are you doin'?" Like it knows.

Tolkien

Well, you're kinda havin' fun now, aren't you?

Butters

Yeah. It is fun to get away and just talk to you guys. [the mummy pops up outside their window and throws its arms at it three times. The boys are spooked for a bit, then calm down] Oh, gosh darnit. [leaves the table] Hang on a second, fellas. [the mummy's eyes follow him]

-----


Tegridy Farms, day. Randy is putting new labels on jars of Tegridy Weed and humming, then placing them on a table by the front door

Randy

Okay, that should be enough Halloween Special for the first few people [there are some 84 jars on the table] Now, I think we should put the open bar in this area [screen left] and the hot tub maybe right here [screen right. Shelly walks in wearing a backpack].

Towelie

Yeah, that'll work well.

Shelly

Dad, you have to drive me to the book fair.

Randy

What what? [chuckles]

Shelly

Mom said you have to drive me because she's taking Stan trick-or-treating.

Randy

[skeptical] You're going to a book fair?

Shelly

Yes.

Randy

On fucking Halloweed?

Shelly

Yes!

Randy

[squeezes his face] I don't even know how to deal with you anymore. [gets in her face] You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?!

Shelly

[moves to the front door] You're my dad, drive me to the book fair!

Randy

I will not! I have things to get ready, and nobody cares about books on Halloween, Shelly!

Shelly

The last thing people in this town need is more marijuana! [kicks the legs out from under the table, and the jats crash onto the floor, shattering. She leaves]

Randy

OH MY GOD! [kneels next to his ruined product]

-----


Park County Police Station. Randy is talking to Det. Harris, with Shelly beside him

Randy

[sobbing] It's a nightmare! It's a personal hell! I've done everything I can, as a father, to help he with her problem, but she just ignores everything I say! I can't do this!

Shelly

You're such a piece of shit, Dad!

Randy

Oh, Shelly, I love you!

Det. Harris

What does her mother have to say about this?

Randy

Her mother doesn't say anything anymore! Whenever I bring up our daughter's marijuana problem, my wife says "I'm gonna lose my mind if you bring this up again." It's destroying all of us! I just think, maybe a night in jail is the wakeup call that she needs. I'm barely gonna have fun at the Halloween Special now! It's gonna be really hard for me to rage knowing you're in here, Shelly. It's gonna be really hard for me to rage! [an officer takes Shelly to a jail cell nearby, then opens it for her]

Officer Brown

Alright, there you go. [Shelly goes in and turns around] When you have a problem with drugs and alcohol, you hurt everyone around you. Happy Halloween. [slides the door shut]

Butters

What are you in for? I'm in here because *apparently* I'm a passive-aggressive controlling and manipulative psychopath whose narcissitic behavior drives other people crazy.

-----


Tegridy Farms, night. The Halloween special is undreway. Klieg lights shine their beams into the sky. MC Hammer's "Turn This Mutha Out" pumps through the loudspeakers. The living room is filing with people

Guest 1

Hey, trick or treat. We're here for the Halloween Special?

Towelie

All right, here you go, guys. [hands him a jar of Halloween Special] That's a promotional gift from Tegridy Farms.

Randy

Hey, come on in, guys! There's candy and hot dogs!

Guest 2

Alright. [Towelie hands him a jar as well]

Randy

Samplers of the special are there on the table, guys. Feel free to light up!

Towelie

Wow, we're almost out, Randy. I gotta go to the barn and get some more.

Randy

Okay, I'll hold down the fort. [Towelie leaves]

-----


Tegridy Farms, outside. Towelie walks through the field to the barn

Towelie

Jimmy crack corn and I don't care. Jimmy crack- [stops] Uh, what? [a bright light shines through all the windows on the barn as the Halloween Special has spread to the exterior walls of the barn]

-----


Park County Police Station, night

Butters

So I said, "Okay, fine. You don't ever do anything wrong! It's all me! You've got no problems, only I have problems! Alright, uh I'll lock my own ass up! Then we'll see who's got issues!"

Shelly

Will you SHUT UP?

Butters

I'll be in here, and something will go horribly wrong tonight, and then the monster will have to accept what it is, and finally work on changing, right?

Shelly

Probably not.

-----


Tegridy Farms, the Halloween Special event. Randy is talking to one of the guests in the hot tub

Randy

Naw, you see, fluvial geomorphology deals with the way rivers change over time. It's geology shit. It's why I got out of it, really.

Guest 2

Hey man, what's in this weed? [guests around him are clutching their bellies]

Randy

Oh! That's a company secret, my friend!

Guest 1

No, I meant I- I don't feel so good. [begins to gargle and growl]

Randy

Hey, are you alright there, buddy? [marijuana seems to sprout on the guest's body and turned him into a zombie. He turns around and growls at Randy] Whoa, dude, did you see that?! [looks over at his guest, who now, too, looks zombified. Randy jumps out of the hot tub when he notices all his guests looking like zombies, puts on a towel and runs outside]

-----


The marijuana field. Randy and Towelie run into each other

Both

AAAAA!

Randy

Towelie! There's something wrong with thte special!

Towelie

There's somethin' in the barn! The thing you killed! It wants revenge! [they head for the barn, and Randy sees it glowing like Towelie did before]

Randy

Oh Jesus! What happened?! [goes inside while Towelie waits outside]

Towelie

It's dead because o'you! And now it wants your soul!

Randy

[faces him] What?! What's dead because o'me?! [a shadow rises up and Randy notices: it's Winnie the Pooh clutching his intestines]

Pooh

[cocks his head to one side] Oh, hello there. Would you like to die?

Randy

[runs out] Ooooohh! Winnie the Pooh! Winnie the Pooh!

-----


Park County Police Station, night. An officer runs in

Officer Brown

Detective Harris! Something's going down at the Marsh farm!

Officer

Calm down, sir! I can't understand you!

Det. Harris

Put him on speaker. [the officer switches from earpiece to speaker]

Randy

There's monsters everywhere! It's some kind of curse! Unspeakable evil!

Butters

[listening from his cell] The mummy! I told you!

Randy

All different kindds of monsters! Zombies and plant people and bears! Oh my God! What's that?! Oh my God, it's Harvey Weinstein! He's got me! You've got to-argh! He's inside me! Harvey Weinstein is inside me! You've gotta send help! People are dying everywhere! No! Harvey, I said no! Please, somebody co- [the connection is cut]

Det. Harris

This is it, everyone! Let's move! All hands on deck! We've gotta take these monsters down! [all the officers rush out. Yakes returns]/i> Bring the kid who manipulates the mummy with his passive-aggressive serlfishness! [an officer opens the jail cell, and Butters and Shelly walk out] 

-----


Tegridy Farms, night. The Special event is still in full swing as the police pull up to the entrance. The officers leave their cruisers and jump into position with their rifles. An officer brings out a bazooka

Det. Harris

Alright, men, let's take thee monsters out!

Shelly

[intervenes] No, just hold on a second! I'll take care of this. [walks to the house. Meanwhile, out back, Randy and Towelie are still running, but are stopped by the cose they slaughtered in "Let Them Eat Goo."]

Randy

Oh God, it's the cows we killed!

Pooh

Oh. I'm really going to enjoy eating your brains. [leaps up to Randy's head and starts gnawing on it.]

Randy

Get 'im off of me! Get 'im off of me! Oh my God! Get 'im off of me! [In her bedroom, Shelly is cooking up an antidote. She hears Randy and Towelie screaming and goes to look out the window] Waugh! Get 'im off of me!

Both

Help! Somebody help us! Get them off of me! Waugh! [she sees them flailing about, but with no cows, bears, or other monsters around them. They are hallucinating]

Both

Somebody help us!

Towelie

Somebody help us!

Randy

Get 'im off of me! Augh! We gotta fight them, Towelie!

Towelie

Help! somebody help us!

Randy

Waugh!

Towelie

I wanna live! Get them of of me! Help! sombody help us!

Randy

We're going to live! We're going to live! [Shelly goes back to her pot and continues brewing] Help! Waugh, get him off of me! Get him off of me! You monsters! Go back to hell! [they begin to babble, and Randy punches the air] There's too many of 'em! [looks off to his left] Oh! What is, What is that?! [a blurry Shelly runs up to him with her pot] Oh! No! [she drenches him with her potion and he goes limp. He murmurs a fewwwww syllables and falls over]

-----


Tebridy Farms, entrance.

Det. Harris

Alright, that's it everyone! Nothin' to see here. Just some people who are really, really high.

Officers

[let down] Aawwwwwwww.

Officer Stevens

I can't shoot anyone?

Det. Harris

[walks up to Butters] You were so convinced the mummy was to blame for everything, weren't you? So convinced you made us all believe it too.

Butters

I'm... [cups his hands together] I'm sorry?

Det. Harris

Yeah, well it's not us ...you really need to be sorry to. [looks over Butters' head at something. Butters follows his gaze amd sees tje mummy standing at the farm's entrance.] Let's see if you even have a shred of decency to apologize when something is clearly your fault. [Butters walks to the mummy]

Butters

I'm so sorry. You're right. I can be selfish and narcissistic. Ah I'm gonna work on myself and... and try to make this curse work somehow. [the mummy rreaches into a back pocket and gives Butters a parting present, sighs, and walks over to a red car, opens the trunk, packs his suitcase, closes the trunk, gets into the driver's seat, puts on some sunglasses, and drives away. Butters open the present and reads the letter inside, which is just Egyptian hieroglyphics]

Officer Brown

[looks over Butters' shoulder] It says, "I hope you can get the help you need. I can't fix you"

-----


Tegridy Farms, day. All the decorations are thrown away and lots of trash bins wait for pickup. Inside, Randy comes down the stairs looking quite beat up. The rest of the family is eating toast and cereal.

Randy

Hey, guess I slept in late, huh? What time is it? [serves himself some coffee]

Sharon

It's 8:15 am. November 3rd.

Randy

Ooof, wow. That was some strong-ass Halloween Special, y'all. I mean... I saw rapists in the hot tub, zombie cows. I thought I was gonna die, and then, this fat, bitchy angel came and put me to bed. [Shelly shoots a look at him for a few seconds, then looks at her food] Did everyone enjoy the Halloween Special?

Sharon

No, Randy. Only you did.

Randy

Oh. Well, that was pretty much my target audience anyway. [walks away from the table with his coffee, back to the stairs] Hey, at least I really didn't have butt sex with Harvey Weinstein, huh? [sees something on the floor] Oh [it's a used confom. He picks it up and shows it to the family] Or did I? [twirls it around a few times] Woo! Happy Halloween, everybody! [lets go, and the condom lands on a wall, releasing its contents.]

-----
