The '''Flag-Smasher''' is the name used by two anti-nationalist <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]: '''Karl Morgenthau''' and '''Guy Thierrault'''. The original version was most often a foe of [[Captain America]] while other adversaries include the [[Punisher]], [[Moon Knight]], [[Ghost Rider]], the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], the [[Liberteens]] and [[Deadpool]].

A group called the [[Flag Smashers]] appeared in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] / [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]'' (2021), led by a female version of the Karl Morgenthau incarnation renamed '''[[Karli Morgenthau]]''' (portrayed by [[Erin Kellyman]]).

==Concept and creation==
[[Mark Gruenwald]] created Flag-Smasher as a character in the tradition of the [[Red Skull]]: a villain with a symbolic aspect that would make him a nemesis specifically for Captain America. Whereas the Red Skull symbolizes [[Nazism]], Flag-Smasher symbolizes anti-patriotism.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dwight Jon |last=Zimmerman |date=January 1988 |title=Mark Gruenwald |work=Comics Interview |issue=#54 |page=14 |publisher=Fictioneer Books}}</ref> The character first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #312 (Dec. 1985).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=129}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Karl Morgenthau===
The first Flag-Smasher was born Karl Morgenthau,<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update'' #1</ref> the son of a wealthy [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[banker]]-turned-[[diplomat]], in [[Bern|Bern, Switzerland]]. He wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and become a diplomat until his father was trampled to death in a riot at a [[Latveria]]n embassy. He came to believe that humanity needed to do away with the concept of countries and nationalism that made people feel superior to those of different nationalities.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=131}}</ref>

The Flag-Smasher used terrorism to spread anti-nationalist sentiment. He conducted a one-man terrorist campaign in New York City against nationalist symbols, holding hundreds as hostages until the original [[Captain America]] captured him.<ref>''Captain America'' #312</ref> Establishing a society he called [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], whose name was an acronym for "The Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind," he made it an anti-nationalistic terrorist organization and made himself its Supreme Commander. With ULTIMATUM, he hijacked an American airliner, held its passengers hostage, and demanded the surrender of Captain America, who joined forces with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to thwart his plot. For his part when he confronts the supervillain, Captain America tries to persuade Flag-Smasher that while his violent methods are unacceptable, his overall goal of world peace and cooperation is laudable and he should promote it by being a positive example, but the fanatic refuses to listen and has to be subdued by force.<ref>''Captain America'' #321–322</ref>

The Flag-Smasher later learned that the [[Red Skull]] had been funding ULTIMATUM. Surviving assassination attempts ULTIMATUM made upon him, he captured the most recent Captain America ([[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]]). The Flag-Smasher then reluctantly teamed with Captain America, [[Battlestar (comics)|Battle Star]], and [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition-Man]] in thwarting an ULTIMATUM plot to set off a worldwide electromagnetic pulse that would have rendered all electrically operated machinery useless, feeling that completing such an operation using funding provided by a national symbol such as the Red Skull would have compromised his own integrity.<ref>''Captain America'' #348–349</ref>

The Flag-Smasher again made himself head of ULTIMATUM, and attempted to supply armaments to American subversives, but he was thwarted by [[Moon Knight]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Marc Spector, Moon Knight'' #8–9</ref> He then made a new attempt to create anarchy in the United States through distribution of arms to malcontents, but this time, the Punisher and the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] thwarted his plot.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #5–6</ref>

The Flag-Smasher later captured an amnesiac Demolition-Man, but during a battle with U.S. Agent, he fell into the Arctic Ocean.<ref>''Captain America'' #400</ref> [[Roxxon Oil]] turned him into a berserker with super-human strength.<ref>''Captain America'' Annual 1999</ref> However, he later lost those powers.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #22</ref>

The Flag-Smasher was installed as the ruler of [[Rumekistan]] by the V-Battalion as a compromise between powers.<ref>''Citizen V & the V-Battalion: The Everlasting'' #2</ref> It was later revealed that the Flag-Smasher had allegedly been assassinated by Domino as part of a series of events which installed [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] as leader of that nation.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #28</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=3424 |title=10 Years! |publisher=UncannyXmen.Net |access-date=2011-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525044416/http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=3424 |archive-date=2011-05-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Guy Thierrault===
Following the original Flag-Smasher's apparent assassination, [[Canadians|Canadian]] ULTIMATUM agent Guy Thierrault assumed the role to continue the spread of [[anti-nationalism]] agenda.<ref>''Civil War Files'' one-shot</ref><ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' vol. 2 #4</ref><ref>''Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul'' one-shot</ref> During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] story arc, he attacked the [[Third Street Promenade|Santa Monica Farmers' Market]] to show his opposition to the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Super-Human Registration Act]], but the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] defeated him.<ref>''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' #1</ref>

Later, a fight between the Flag-Smasher and [[Anya Corazon|Araña]] was described. The second Flag-Smasher struck Araña with his mace, but [[Spider-Man]] later defeated him.<ref>''Doctor Strange: The Oath'' #1</ref> He was next shown being described as the ''new'' Flag-Smasher.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Avengers: The Initiative'' Annual #1</ref>

After this he was seen fighting against [[Liberteens]], but was defeated and imprisoned.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The Flag-Smasher then returned and launched an attack on a New York diner, where Nomad (Rikki Barnes) was having a chat with her friend John. The explosion caused John to get hurt, and Rikki quickly put on her new Nomad uniform to fight the Flag-Smasher, who was now wearing a similar suit to the original Flag-Smasher. The [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and Redwing helped Nomad defeat the Flag-Smasher, who was again arrested and jailed.<ref>''Nomad: Girl Without a World'' #2</ref>

The Flag-Smasher later kidnapped a Middle Eastern banker, but was confronted by [[Flash Thompson]], who then succumbed the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]'s murderous tendencies. After killing the Flag-Smasher's cohorts, Venom then bit off the Flag-Smasher's right arm.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654.1</ref>

After an ULTIMATUM [[helicarrier]] was infiltrated and many of its members were slaughtered by Deadpool,<ref>''Deadpool'' #23</ref> the Flag-Smasher confronted, and was defeated by Deadpool, who ordered him and his followers to stay away from the Merc and his daughter.<ref>''Deadpool'' #33</ref>

The Flag-Smasher was later apparently murdered by another ULTIMATUM member named Carl, who then assumed the identity to achieve vengeance against Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool'' #43</ref>

Eventually, this Flag-Smasher was apparently slaughtered, as were all of the ULTIMATUM forces, after they attacked Deadpool a final time, thus apparently ending both ULTIMATUM and the Flag-Smasher.<ref>''Deadpool'' #45</ref>

===LMD===
A new version of Flag-Smasher and iteration of ULTIMATUM announce their presence to the world by crashing a gala being held in honor of Tom Herald, a conservative senator from Texas. Attaching time bombs to Herald and six others, Flag-Smasher attempts to coerce two versions of Captain America, Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson, into joining him, before arming both the explosives and "data bombs" that will leak the [[National Security Agency|NSA]]'s surveillance data, decrypt America's nuclear launch codes, and erase the country's electronic banking sanctions and its [[No Fly List]]. The digital bombs and three of the  physical ones are disarmed by [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], but Flag-Smasher and his minions escape after Wilson fails to stop them from shooting Herald.<ref name = "CASW14">{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Paul Renaud|inker = Paul Renaud|colorist = John Roach|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Tom Brevoort|story = #TakeBackTheSheild|title = Captain America: Sam Wilson|volume = |issue = #14|date = 19 Oct. 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

The attack is afterward revealed to have been secretly orchestrated by Rogers, who had come to believe of being a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] agent due personal history being rewritten by [[Kobik]]. This Flag-Smasher is in fact a [[Life Model Decoy]] that [[Erik Selvig]] had built to assassinate Senator Herald on Rogers's behalf.<ref name = "CASW14"/>

==Powers and abilities==
The Flag-Smasher is an athletic man who is a gifted hand-to-hand combatant with great proficiency in the martial art of ''[[Shotokan|shotokan karate-do]].'' He is also a brilliant terrorist strategist, and has fluency in English, French, German, Russian, Italian, Japanese, and [[Esperanto]].

[[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]] personnel have supplied him with a number of weapons and other devices, including a flame-throwing pistol, a teargas gun, a spiked mace, a shield, jet-propelled skis used for flight, teleportation devices, submarines, and rocket-propelled hovercraft.

==Other versions==
The limited comic book series "[[Spider-Geddon]]" features an Earth-138 version of Karl Morgenthau known as '''Captain Anarchy'''. This version sports an outfit similar to Captain America's, wields an unbreakable shield, and is empowered by a Super-Insurgent Serum. He fights the Annihilation Wave when [[Spider-Punk]] shows up and asks him for a tape. Despite interference from a member of the Annihilation Wave, Captain Anarchy is able to give it to him just as [[Kang the Conqueror#Spider-Geddon|Kang the Conglomerator]] shows up in an attempt to kidnap Spider-Punk. However, Captain Anarchy is able to hold off Kang while Spider-Punk gets away. When Kang is defeated by Spider-Punk and the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Spider-Geddon|Hulk]], he states that Captain Anarchy is not marketable and died old while Spider-Punk died young.<ref>''Edge of Spider-Geddon'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
An anarchist group called the '''[[Flag Smashers]]''' appears in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] miniseries ''[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |last=Matsumoto-Duyan |first=Madeline |date=December 12, 2020 |title=The Falcon and the Winter Soldier: The Biggest Revelations From the Trailer |url=https://www.cbr.com/falcon-winter-soldier-trailer-breakdown/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201212204512/https://www.cbr.com/falcon-winter-soldier-trailer-breakdown/ |archive-date=December 12, 2020 |access-date=December 12, 2020 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> led by a younger, female version of Karl Morgenthau named '''[[Karli Morgenthau]]''', portrayed by [[Erin Kellyman]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marston |first=George |date=February 9, 2021 |title=How Marvel Comics villain Flag-Smasher ties into The Falcon and the Winter Soldier |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/falcon-winter-soldier-flag-smasher-explained/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209162044/https://www.gamesradar.com/falcon-winter-soldier-flag-smasher-explained/ |archive-date=February 9, 2021 |access-date=February 9, 2021 |website=[[Newsarama]]}}</ref> The group, whose members are empowered by a recreated [[Super Soldier Serum]] and possess [[superhuman strength]], seek to restore the world to how it was during [[the Blip]], only to run afoul of [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], [[John Walker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|John Walker]], [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]], and the [[Power Broker (character)|Power Broker]].
