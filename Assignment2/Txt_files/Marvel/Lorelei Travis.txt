==Fictional character biography==

===Living in Mutant Town===
Lorelei Travis is the name of a young girl who has "living" hair. Lorelei is an exotic dancer at the mob leader Daniel Kaufman's Wildkat Klub in Mutant Town located in New York City. Lorelei had managed to become one of the Wildkat Klub's household names through the artistic use of her genetic mutation.

During a recent investigation into Kaufman's businesses by [[Bishop (comics)|Lucas Bishop]] and [[Ismael Ortega]], Lorelei survived a bombing of the Wildkat Klub perpetrated by Kaufman's enemies, sustaining minor injuries.

===M-Day and The 198===
Lorelei is one of the few mutants to retain her powers after the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], although she is attacked outside her work by a group of militant Purity members. They cut all of her hair simply because she is still a mutant. Unlikely help comes in the form of [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]] who, after saving her, escorts her to the [[X-Mansion]] to join the other members of [[the 198]].<ref>''X-Men: The 198'' #1</ref> Her hair is restored by the healing powers of [[Mister M (comics)|Mr. M]] whom she starts a relationship with not long after and she barely leaves his side.<ref>''X-Men: The 198'' #2-3</ref> When the [[Office of National Emergency|O*N*E]] implant chips in the mutants necks, they all learn that they cannot leave the estate whenever they please and if they misbehave, they receive an electric shock. After Mr. M removes them, she suggests to Mr. M that they leave and anyone who wants to, can come with them.

Mr. M leads the mutants to a nearby island in the middle of a lake and are joined by the O*N*E and the [[X-Men]]. A fight breaks out and [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] has a gun pointed at [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s head. Lorelei gets involved and Scalphunter punches her, this makes Mr. M furious which eventually leads to his death by [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], who is being manipulated by a mutant by the name of [[Johnny Dee]].<ref>''X-Men: The 198'' #4</ref>

Outside the X-Men get involved with a fight against Bishop and the O*N*E, and Domino wants to help them. Lorelei notices that [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] is being controlled by Johnny Dee and recounts the story of the first few days at the 198 encampment. She is then used by Dee along with [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]] and other mutants to attack Domino and Shatterstar. When Dee's efforts are revealed, the bunker is sealed by the military.<ref>''X-Men: Civil War'' #3</ref> Eventually the 198 are freed from the bunker.<ref>''X-Men: Civil War'' #4</ref>

===Dark Reign===

Believing this to be a last stand for mutant rights, Hellion gathers the group at a bar with the intent to break curfew and get arrested on TV in non-violent protest. The group fails to make its intended point as Match torches the surrounding area with his powers, and Lorelei is arrested by [[Emma Frost]] and her [[Dark X-Men]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref> They are taken into custody after a battle.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #7</ref> Eventually Lorelei and the other imprisoned mutants are freed by the [[X-Force]] and teleported to the island of Utopia.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1''</ref>
