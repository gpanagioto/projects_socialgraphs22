Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea... God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay.   -m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay.
