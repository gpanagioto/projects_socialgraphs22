And so I said to the guy, "you really think I'm paying that much?" I thought we were past this. Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words "fag" and "faggot" are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders! We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots! You can do it, boys! We believe in you! Come on boys, you can do it!   We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!
