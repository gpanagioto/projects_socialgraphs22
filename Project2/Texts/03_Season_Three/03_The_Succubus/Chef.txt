 Oh! Hello there, children! Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit. Well, it's true. Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and ''really'' hit it off. No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked. Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself. Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica. Children, Veronica is moving in with me. I'm in love. Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me. Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too. <poem><i> We have a chance to find the sunshine.</i></poem> Hello there, children. Eric, you got glasses! Huh? You bet!  Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old. Why not?? Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even ''you'' will have to face with each other some day. That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did. You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball? Oh! Uh, hello there, children. Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot. Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing. Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married.  My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too. Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back.  It's okay, pop. What?! All right guys! That's e''nough!'' I have ''had'' it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and ''you'' can't be happy for me! No buts, Stan!  Iii do!   What the-?! What the-?!   No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her. Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream. Hello there, children! How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots? Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: <poem><i><br />Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.<br />You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.<br />But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.<br />And then you're left with nothing, cause your thinking with your dong. So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!<br />Just play it cool and don't be a fool...</i></poem> <poem><i>Daaamn right, Garrison! </i></poem>
