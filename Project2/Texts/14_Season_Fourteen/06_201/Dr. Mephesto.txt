There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of.  Yes? What do you want? Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in. There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there. No, please, it isn't that at all. No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in.  WAAH! Eric Cartman? Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them. Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.  Very well. Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in!  Oh, all right. It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly. Yes? Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American. Beat it I'm not helpin' you! No no, you don't understand. Alright, alright, jeez.  What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go. It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
