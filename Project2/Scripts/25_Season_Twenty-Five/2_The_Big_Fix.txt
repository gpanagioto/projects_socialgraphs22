+++++Colorado Convention Center, exterior, daytime. A banner that reads "Welcome Cannabis Growers! - Cannabis Cultivators Expo" is prominently shown as people enter the convention center. Inside, an exhibit hall featuring cannabis related items on display is shown. Then, Room B is shown, with a sign at the entrance that reads "THE CHANGING FACE OF HEMP FARMING". In the room, a spokesperson is giving a speech about marijuana.+++++
Spokesperson : As farmers and cultivators of marijuana, we have a responsibility to society... ''[Randy is seen, high]'' I know we all respect the crop here, and we seek each day to better understand the nuances and legitimacy of its uses.
Randy : Let's go weed! Wew!
Spokesperson : But we growers must face a harsh reality– Since the legalization of marijuana, communities of color, black and brown Coloradans, those most affected by the racist war on drugs, have now been locked out of the wealth creation of the industry. ''[Randy yawns loudly and stretches]'' Luckily, the public is starting to understand this unfairness– and many people are now talking of boycotting cannabis growers who are only white owned.
Randy : Boycotting what? Wait... what?
Spokesperson : We are seeing a healthy and dramatic spike in consumers who demand that their marijuana be grown by those who understand the fight for social equity.
Randy : Ugh ahhug–
Spokesperson : The bottom line is this– a completely white owned weed business these days... just isn't going to survive. ''[dramatic music plays as the scene cuts away]''
+++++Tegridy Farms, night time. Randy is sitting at the kitchen table with his family.+++++
Randy : Guys... I wanna have kind of a tough talk with you. We don't really have any black friends, we don't reach out to the black community. Shelley, you never bring any black dudes over. I mean, Stan, your three best friends are all white.
Stan : There's only one black kid in my whole class.
Randy : Yes, that kid Token. How come you never hang out with him?
Stan : I do hang out with him!
Randy : In a group maybe, but I don't recall just you and Token ever doing anything. I've never seen Token here at the farm, just like the two of you guys. Why not?
Stan : I... I don't know.
Sharon : Randy, stop. We're not racists.
Randy : We'd like to think that, wouldn't we? But... actions speak louder than words, gang. I guess... I guess I just want you to think about it. ''[he gets up and leaves, leaving the rest of the Marsh family looking confused]''
+++++South Park Elementary, recess. Tolkien is throwing a football with Butters when Stan approaches him.+++++
Stan : Uh, hey, Token.
Tolkien : Oh, hey Stan.
Stan : Uh, listen, I uh... How you doin'?
Tolkien : ''[he looks at Stan]'' Fine.
Stan : Um... You think your family would wanna come over for dinner? Out at our farm?
Tolkien : It's kinda far, isn't it?
Stan : Yeah but... Look, Token, I think maybe you and I should hang out more.
Tolkien : What are you talking about?
Stan : I mean, we never just hang out, you and me.
Butters : Hey, we never hang out just you and me either, Stan!
Stan : Shut up, Butters. Look, just will you please just see if your family will come over for dinner? It would mean a lot.
+++++Tegridy Farms, night time. Randy is setting the table for dinner. The Blacks are sitting with them.+++++
Randy : Ok, there we go. This is a farm fresh hemp salad sourced locally here at Tegridy! Alright, come on everybody, dig in.
Linda : Thank you so much for having us over. This is really nice.
Steve : We've never been to a marijuana farm before.
Randy : Well, you know, with our boys starting to become so close– we thought we better get the families together! If they're friends, then we need to be friends! Huh? ''[he pulls out his phone and starts recording]'' Do you mind if I post this? ''[to the camera]'' Check out our friends! ''[he snaps the photo]''
Steve : Randy... I hope you didn't invite us here because we're black.
Randy : W-what are you talking about?
Linda : It's just that the past year or so a lot of people have been inviting us over to dinner and then taking pictures of us to show everyone on Instagram.
Randy : Oh, that's so lame. No, we really just wanted to get to know you guys better since Stan is friends with Token. You know... just out of curiosity– why did you guys name him that?
Steve : What do you mean?
Randy : Well– I mean, it's just kind of an odd name, isn't it? Like, some people might think you guys naming your son that isn't very cool.
Steve : People have a problem with Tolkien's name?
Randy : Well I mean other people just think it's a little... I mean, come on, I mean, I'm– I'm not calling you guys racist, but– why did you name your son that?
Linda : My husband has always been a huge fan of ''Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit''.
Steve : I wanted to name my son after my favorite author. But she didn't want to name our son J.R.R., so we just named him Tolkien.
Randy : ''[shocked]'' His name is Tolkien?
Steve : Yes, you know his name is Tolkien!
Stan : ''[to Tolkien]'' I thought your name was "Token".
Tolkien : My name is "Tolkien".
Steve : Sorry, I don't think it's that weird. J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the most prolific, influential writers of our time.
Randy : ''[to himself]'' Holy shit, that's what his name means?
Steve : What did you think his name meant?
Randy : ''[pause]'' Would you like to see how we grow and process our weed?
+++++Randy is giving Steve Black a tour through the refinery.+++++
Randy : You see, it's all about refinement. Here at Tegridy, we believe the best weed is untouched from the earth– so we distill it down to its basic essence. Over there are our clean out vats and up here we have our first stage drying racks. Oh, real quick! ''[he poses with Steve for a picture]'' It all takes about six days from the field to a jar that we can sell. So... what do you think?
Steve : It's... uh, very involved.
Randy : Yeah, it takes a lot. You know– I just had a crazy idea... Our boys are best friends now... Why don't you come work for Tegridy?
Steve : Randy, I have a job. I'm a very successful co-executive of a financial consulting firm.
Randy : Oh my gosh– I was just saying we could really use a co-executive of financial consulting! Look, I... Would it be okay if... If I sent you some of our receipts and you could help us– financial consult?
Steve : Well that's what we do... Sure.
Randy : Oh my God, this is amazing. Here's to the start of something wonderful. Would you like some free weed?
Steve : No.
+++++Kyle's house, night time. He's at his computer playing video games when his cellphone rings.+++++
Kyle : ''[he answers]'' Hey Stan.
Stan : Dude... my head is reeling, you're not gonna believe this.
Kyle : Not gonna believe what?
Stan : Token's name isn't Token. It's Tolkien.
Kyle : Yeah, I know it's Tolkien.
Stan : No, no, no, no. He's named after the guy who wrote ''The Hobbit'' and stuff!
Kyle : Yeah, I know. J.R.R. Tolkien. What did you think it was?
Stan : ''[horrified]'' You knew it was Tolkien like the writer.
Kyle : Everyone knew it was Tolkien.
Stan : No, no, no! No, no, no, no! I distinctly remember Cartman wearing a shirt where he spelled it T-O-K-E-N.
Kyle : Yeah, dude, ‘cuz Cartman's a fuckin' moron.
Stan : Wha– hold on a second! ''[he calls Cartman]''
+++++Cartman residence, night time. Eric is lying on the living room couch, eating a bag of chips.+++++
Cartman : ''[watching TV while he answers]'' Whatsup, dog.
Stan : Dude, Cartman, did you know that Tolkien is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?
Cartman : Well yeah, I just figured.
Stan : Then why did you spell it "Token" without the "L" or the "I"?!
Cartman : J.R.R. Tolkien has an "L" in it? That's gay. Who did you think Tolkien was named after?
Tolkien : ''[from outside the room]'' Stan? You out here?
Stan : Uh, yeah, hang on a second Tolk-kien, just taking a shit.
Tolkien : Oh, okay, sorry.
Stan : Oh my God... I suck...
+++++The Black residence, early in the morning. Steve Black gets into his car and starts driving, listening to the radio.+++++
Radio : This is your mornin' commute, South Park. Looks like we have a bit of slowing heading into town. There's like a truck and a couple cars... maybe take ya a couple minutes there. Also, if you're heading out of town on the main road there's a– there's like a car there, too.
Steve : What the fuck? ''[he notices a Tegridy billboard with him and Randy plastered on it]''
Radio : Now let's look at the weather...Weather's looking like we're gonna have a little bit of snow. And the uh– ''[Steve speeds up]''
+++++Tegridy Farms. Steve Black is knocking angrily on Randy's door. Randy answers.+++++
Steve : What the hell are you doing?
Randy : Taking shit tons of Tegridy orders. Sales are going nuts right now.
Steve : No– why is my face on a billboard?!
Randy : Because we work together?
Steve : You said you just needed someone to help with accounting!
Randy : Yes, but then– you got promoted! I was gonna surprise you. Don't you see how lucrative this can be? I mean, we make a pretty damn good team in the weed business. I mean, we are Ben and Jerry– We're Ben and Jerry. You're Jerry, and I'm Ben.
Towelie : I thought I was Jerry...
Randy : No, you're a towel.
Towelie : Oh, that's even better.
Steve : I told you before that I'm not interested in the marijuana business. I don't believe in drinking or doing drugs.
Randy : Doing dru– Do you remember when Bilbo first set out with the dwarves to fight Smaug? What's the first thing they all did? They partied their asses off. ''[singing]'' Chip the glasses, click the plates. That's what Bilbo Baggins hates. ''[pause]'' And then they certainly had an adventure together, didn't they? Filled with... ''[he pulls out a wad of cash and puts it in Steve's pocket]'' Lucrative treasure.
Steve : You really think we could make a lot of money together?
Randy : Ben and Jerry, my man. Ben and fuckin' Jerry.
+++++Stan is sitting at the doctor's office. The doctor enters the room.+++++
Doctor : Hey-hey! Stan the man! How ya doin' buddy? ''[he reaches out for a fist bump]''
Stan : ''[returning the fist bump]'' Okay, I guess...
Doctor : The nurse said you came here by yourself. No parents?
Stan : I kinda wanted to talk about something in private.
Doctor : Oh, okay, pal. What is it?
Stan : I think... I might be horribly racist.''[pause]''
Doctor : Well, kiddo... you don't normally go to a doctor's office for feeling racist, but tell me what happened.
Stan : So... there's this kid at my school, and... he's black. And his parents named him after the guy that wrote ''Lord of the Rings.''
Doctor : Uh huh, Tolkien. Great name.
Stan : Yeah... well, I-I thought his name was Token. Like– like a black kid that's just there so that... like... there's a black kid.
Doctor : Uh huh... and how long have you thought that?
Stan : The whole time! I've thought that the whole time!
Doctor : Wow. Fuck you.
Stan : Huh?
Doctor : You really thought a couple of black people had a child and named him Token? Why would anyone name a black kid Token? You're a piece of shit.
Stan : No, I was just try–
Doctor : You were just going along with the dominant culture of the white paradigm, that's what you were just– Get out of my office, you make me sick!
Stan : I'm sorry!
Doctor : I don't know what's wrong with some people. I wonder if anyone else thought that this kid's name was Token? Hmm? Anybody? Anyone else just assume his name was Token? Because that's disgusting, and you are the problem.
Stan : Doctor?
Doctor : I thought I told you to get out of my office, because you seriously make me sick– I'm gonna shit my fucking pants right now.
Stan : Doctor, please, I don't want to be like this! I'll do anything, just tell me what to do!
Doctor : Oh, you wanna change? Then I suggest you start doing a lot of reading.
Stan : Okay, what should I read?
Doctor : ''[ignoring Stan]'' And I suggest that when you're reading– you do it from the perspective of a black person! ''[he leaves]''
+++++Stan's room. He is sitting on his bed reading a book.+++++
Narrator :  ''[speaking in African-American vernacular dialect]'' The knight Pigwiggen rides on a frisky earwig, and sends his love, Queen Mab, a bracelet of emmet's eyes, making an assignation... ''[scene cuts to Stan outside, still reading]'' Old Tom Bombadil was a merry fellow. Bright blue his jacket was, and his boots was yellow... ''[scene cuts to him reading in the library]'' It is told that in their beginning, the dwarves was made by Aule in the darkness of Middle-Earth.
+++++Music plays over stock footage of a black puppy playing with a white puppy, then a montage of Randy and Steve working at Tegridy Farms+++++
+++++Randy and Steve are now in court, being seen before a judge.+++++
Judge : As the owners of Tegridy Farms, you are accused of plagiarizing a song for your marijuana company. How do you plead?
Randy : Not guilty, your honor.
Judge : The complaint says that you asked for the rights to the song "Ebony and Ivory," but when you were turned down by Paul McCartney, you copied the song into something similar.
Randy : Not true, your honor. I've never even heard Paul McCartney's version. "Black Puppy White Puppy" is a song I wrote by myself on my piano keyboard.
+++++The singing resumes, with Randy and Steve now walking in the field at sunset. Randy then puts his arm around Steve's shoulders as they continue their stroll.+++++
+++++South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's classroom. Stan is at the front, wearing glasses and speaking.+++++
Stan : Guys... lately I've been doing a lot of soul searching. I've had to ask myself hard questions, because for a long time now, I've misinterpreted some amazing writing. I've done a lot of reading... And I've learned why Sauron built the black gate of Mordor across the path of Cirith Grogor, which led into the enclosed plain of Udun. I've learned that the Mouth of Sauron was once a man, who commanded the armies of Gorgoroth and dismissed Aragorn's claim as King.
Cartman : ''[leaning over to Kyle]'' I think Stan's lost his marbles.
Stan : I firmly believe that everyone would benefit from the school making required reading of these books. Because if we don't fully know about Tolkien, then we can make some terrible, offensive mistakes. In fact... did you guys know that our friend Tolkien, who goes to school here, is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?
Butters : Yup!
Clyde : Yeah, I knew that.
Heather : Why else would his name be Tolkien if it wasn't for the guy that wrote the books?
Stan : ''[glares]'' My point is, we need to petition the school to make Tolkien required reading. To better understand our classmate. I think maybe we all haven't done enough to make sure than Tolkien doesn't feel isolated and left out.
Tolkien : ''[opening the door]'' Guys? Can I come in now?
Stan : Not yet, Token. Just another couple minutes.
Tolkien : W-what are you guys talking about?
Stan : ''[pause]'' Just a couple minutes, bro. ''[Tolkien leaves, closing the door]''
+++++Tegridy Farms. Hip hop music plays while Randy and Towelie dance and smoke a joint in the barn.+++++
Steve : ''[enters the barn]'' Hey, guys, I've got something really exciting to show you!
Randy : ''[the music suddenly stops as he turns around]'' Ohhhh, buzzkill...
Steve : I had this awesome idea last night... and I couldn't even sleep, I thought it was so cool–
Randy : Okay, what is it?
Steve : ''[he clicks the keys on his laptop]'' We do an entire line of cannabis based on all the different races of Middle Earth! ''[Randy looks unimpressed]'' We do seven different strains in all, representing the dwarves, the elves, even the uruk hai!
Randy : Uhh, yeah... no.
Towelie : Everyone will think we're dorks! ''[they both chuckle]''
Steve : ''[annoyed]'' Randy, you seem not to care very much about any of my ideas.
Randy : Well, you're just– you know, you're just not the idea guy.
Steve : I don't seem to be the anything guy. I thought we were Ben and Jerry.
Randy : Alright, look, I'm gonna tell you the truth about ice cream– Jerry actually doesn't do shit. Ben does it all, everyone knows that.
Steve : Well, I don't want to just be here like some kind of... token black person.
Randy : Oh, come on, I'm sorry.
Steve : No. I totally get now why you want me around, and I'm not gonna do it. ''[he storms off]''
Randy : ''[smoking weed]'' He doesn't even really sound like a black guy, you know that?
+++++South Park Elementary gymnasium. PC Principal is holding an assembly for the students.+++++
PC Principal : Alright everyone, listen up! We have a special announcement today. One of our fourth grade students says he's done a lot of work and has grown as a person. And he'd like to share his journey with you. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
Stan : Sup, guys. You know, I've done a lot of reading lately. And I'd like to announce that the school has allowed me to declare today J.R.R. Tolkien appreciation day! ''[the crowd is silent]'' These books go so much deeper than the Hollywood movies. And we see its influences everywhere in our modern culture. In fact, how many of you knew that our classmate Tolkien was named after J.R.R. Tolkien? ''[every audience member raises their hand]'' But you don't know that ''Lord of the Rings'' was an analogy for World War II, did you?! And I'll bet you didn't know that there was originally 19 Rings of Power that were forged by Celebrimbor! So there's much we need to understand. And so I would like to bring up the man himself. Come on up here, Tolkien! Come on!
Tolkien : ''[the crowd awkwardly claps as Tolkien walks up to Stan]'' I actually don't like ''Lord of the Rings.'' And I don't like ''The Hobbit.'' Just cause my dad's into that stuff doesn't mean that I am. I've always hated that my name is Tolkien, but I didn't really have a choice, did I? So please, whatever you do, just don't draw any more attention to my name. I can't stand any of it. It's just a bunch of nerdy, jive-ass dragon shit. ''[he drops the mic and angrily walks back to his seat]''
+++++Stan's room. He is laying in bed, looking upset. Sharon enters the room.+++++
