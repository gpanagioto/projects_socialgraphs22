The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer. Right. Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before ''more'' people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park.  Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!  Exactly! Mayor. Why? Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park.  Shmuck! All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh? So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes. And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen?  My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more? Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it. Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why. All right, all right. Name your price. Done. Just find out what's happening. Boy, they're really pissed. Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me.  And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all.
