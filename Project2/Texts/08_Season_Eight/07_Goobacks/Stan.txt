Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages? Cartman, just keep your mouth shut. Whoa. Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future! Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em. Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool. Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today? All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house.  Son of a bitch!  Oh, they took our jobs! I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to-   Who is that? Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs! Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away. I wanted my job! Timecist? People from the future. Right, got it. That's right!  Can you speak in present-day English please? Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.  No, a double cheeseburger and fries! What?! I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger! No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a goddamned cheeseburger and some goddamned fries you fucking goobacks! Aw- awwww! Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you? They took yer jarb!! I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work. We're doing it! Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay. Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile.
