'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!  I told you to shut up! Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much. Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what? We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio. Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go. Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time. Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house. I don't think so.
