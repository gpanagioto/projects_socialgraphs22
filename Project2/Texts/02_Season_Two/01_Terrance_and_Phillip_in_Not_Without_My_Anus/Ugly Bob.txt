Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip. How can you guys say stuff like that? I know, but-- I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside. Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks. Thanks, you guys. Hi, guys. People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday. Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there! All right, then. There's a flight leaving today. Hi guys. I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like? Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine. Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch. I'm Bob. But my friends call me "Ugly Bob", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim. You can? Did you say, "hostile takeover of Canada"? God bless you, Phillip.
