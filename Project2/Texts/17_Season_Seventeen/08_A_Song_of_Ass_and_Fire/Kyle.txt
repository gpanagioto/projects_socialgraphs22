 Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances. It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday. Sony released the PS4s, Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them. If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong. Grounded? For what? No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty! What?  Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control. All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
