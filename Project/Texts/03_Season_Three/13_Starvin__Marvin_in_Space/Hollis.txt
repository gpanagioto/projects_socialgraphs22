No, Marvin, in God's language. English. Where are you going? Back to your life of sin? Don't you understand that unless you find Christ, you and all your people are doomed to eternal hellfire?  Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you. No, it's not food. It's a cross.  Who are you? Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ? Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them.  This is the Missionary 600. We have you locked on "fire: ready." Turn back right now.  The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough. I have the infidels in my sight.  Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes. Now we've got 'em!  Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens. They've opened the wormhole! Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins. What is "marklar"? What the hell did he say? But you will all burn forever in eternal hellfire.
