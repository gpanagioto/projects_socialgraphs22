Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Darkstar and Vanguard are sent along with new Soviet Super-Soldier [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]] by the [[KGB]] to defeat Sergei (aka [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]). Darkstar and Vanguard learn that Sergei is their father, and that [[Professor Phobos]] had exploited the Super-Soldiers. Darkstar helps free Sergei and Starlight, and defeat Phobos.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #258–259. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Darkstar is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has psionic power to access the extradimensional energy of the Darkforce dimension, which grants her a number of superhuman abilities. She is connected to the dimension by splitting her consciousness between her physical body and its Darkforce representation, both symbiotically linked. She can utilize the Darkforce for various purposes, such as causing Darkforce to behave like either matter or energy. Furthermore, she can project Darkforce as simple, mentally-controlled solid objects, possessing the density of steel, such as pincers, rings, columns, and spheres, or as a beam of concussive force. If Darkstar is rendered unconscious, any Darkforce constructs of her making immediately dissipate. Darkstar can [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and up to three others by opening a portal into the Darkforce dimension and traveling through it; the maximum distance she can teleport has never been revealed. Because crossing the Darkforce dimension disorients her sense of direction, and the light of Earth blinds her for several seconds upon reemergence, traveling in this manner is risky.

Darkstar can levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds by generating a virtually invisible portal into the Darkforce dimension along the contours of her body without passing through it, then balancing the attractive force of the dimension against that of the Earth's gravity. The upper limits of her powers are unknown.

Darkstar is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the KGB and by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. She is fluent in both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]].

While the original Darkstar's costume was designed by the Soviet government and was made of a synthetic stretch fabric insulated against the cold, the other two Darkstar costumes are composed of Darkforce material.<ref name="WinterGuard"/>
