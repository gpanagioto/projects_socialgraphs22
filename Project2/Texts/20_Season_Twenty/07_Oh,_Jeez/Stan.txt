I can't imagine how you're feeling right now. I know that the election didn't go the way you'd hoped. What I want to say is, I'm sorry.  I know that girls have gone through a lot lately, and I just want you to know that... I'm here for you. I am gonna change. I, I am. Yeah well, but I, but I want her to take me back. Okay, look. The bottom line is, you still have to have faith... in boys, because... because I miss you, Wendy.  Go away Butters!
