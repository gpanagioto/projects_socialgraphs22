A pandemic special, Randy?! Really?! People are hurting! People are dying, Randy! And all you can think about is making a special about it? You are a child, Randy! These are very serious times and nobody wants or cares about your stupid special right now! How was school, Stanley? I know this has all been really hard on you, Stanley. Do you wanna talk about it? Yeah. Well, it's nice you care about our friend, but if you need to talk... I know this is really hard on everyone. I wasn't saying you wouldn't make money, I was saying maybe that's not what should matter right now! Yes! My brother Jimbo, who is in the hospital! Please do not quote the President in front of our child! What? Oh, I don't know if this is a good idea. I thought that the issue was the teachers not coming back. I want to hear this, Randy! I'm not even sure. Do you know what a pangolin is, Randy?  Randy? Randy? Where are the car keys? Randy! Where are the car keys? I have to get over to the hospital. It's Jimbo. Doctor said he's better, so I can take him home. They said he doesn't have any symptoms, and his tests are showing negative.  Randy?! Randy?! Randy, you've gotta get in here! Come upstairs. Something's wrong with Jimbo!  Last night his fever came back. And then a few hours ago, this thing appeared on his face. Jimbo's never been able to grow a mustache. Should I call the doctor? What, Jimbo?  Why's he talking about your special? I'm gonna get the thermometer.  What the hell are you doing?! Dump it? Why are you worrying about this right now?! Goddammit, Randy, our son is out in this chaos!  Fuck you! Stanley! Staaaaan! What if he's dead, Randy?! Then why hasn't he even called?!  What??  If you're ready to talk, I'm ready to listen, Randy.  What? No. I don't smoke marijuana, Randy. Well, what did you want to talk to me about?
