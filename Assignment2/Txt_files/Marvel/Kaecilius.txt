Kaecilius first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #130 (March 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Kaecilius was a disciple of [[Baron Mordo]], who would deliver messages and even fight [[Doctor Strange]] himself if necessary. One of his first missions was to kidnap the [[Ancient One]], a task he failed due to Doctor Strange's interference. At one point, Mordo took possession of him to test the powers of [[Dormammu]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #135 (Aug. 1965). Marvel Comics.</ref> Kaecilius was successful in stealing Doctor Strange's [[Cloak of Levitation]]; however by the end of the battle, Doctor Strange used his powers to wipe the knowledge of magic from Kaecilius's mind.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #143. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kaecilius and his cohorts, [[Adria (comics)|Adria]] and Demonicus, posed as members of the Independent Video media network to interview Doctor Strange, as a ploy to gain access to the Sanctum Sanctorum. Claiming to be the cameraman Joe Crocker, Kaecilius was found out, along with his fellow sorcerers. The three once again tried and failed to defeat the Sorcerer Supreme. Adria attempted to use a powerful gem against Strange, but only managed to banish herself, Kaecilius and Demonicus to the Purple Dimension.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #56 (Dec. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> Many years later, the three were freed from the Purple Dimension, and battled Doctor Strange, as well as [[Jane Foster]] in her new identity as [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]. Kaecilius displayed vastly improved abilities and a modified appearance (still in his usual costume, but clean shaven and with darkened eyes).<ref>''Valkyrie: Jane Foster'' #4 (Dec. 2019). Marvel Comics.</ref> During the battle, [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] appeared, having been newly empowered by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and trapped Doctor Strange's astral form in a dark mirror. Scared and surrounded by his defeated comrades, Kaecilius "peacefully" left the fight, opening a portal to what looked like [[Paris]], [[France]].<ref>''Valkyrie: Jane Foster'' #5 (Jan. 2020). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Death of Doctor Strange]]" storyline, Kaecilius accompanied Baron Mordo into heading to the Sanctum Sanctorum where Doctor Strange was found dead. As Wong accuses Baron Mordo of killing Doctor Strange which Baron Mordo denied, Kaecilius prepared to defend Baron Mordo from Wong's attacks.  Just then, a classic version of Doctor Strange arrives having sensed that the worst has happened and asks what year is it.<ref>''Death of Doctor Strange'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Three Mothers show up upon tracking Clea to the Sanctum Sanctorum, Baron Mordo and Kaecilius take their leave.<ref>''Death of Doctor Strange'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Classic Doctor Strange, Clea, and Wong fight their way past Castle Mordo's defenses to get to the Eye of Agamotto where they managed to subdue Kaecilius.<ref>''Death of Doctor Strange'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> In New Umarria, Antarctica, Classic Doctor Strange, Clea, and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)|Magik]] arrive and meet with Baron Mordo, Kaecilius, Aggamon, [[Tiboro]], and [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] where he puts them through a murder mystery that involved bringing up why the inter-dimensional warlords fled to Earth and the framing of Baron Mordo. He concludes that Kaecilius is responsible for Doctor Strange's murder as Kaecilius plans to make Baron Mordo "squeal with all the agonies of the Purple Dimension" and then kill Classic Doctor Strange again with Doctor Strange's own powers.<ref>''Death of Doctor Strange'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> As news of the arrival of the Peregrine Child and the Three Mothers are noted, Kaecilius is prepared to attack Classic Doctor Strange who prepares to make Aggamon, Tiboro, and Umar face the consequences of their actions where everyone must prevail or die. As Kaecilius attacks, Classic Doctor Strange casts a special healing spell involving living soul and a flesh base that causes Doctor Strange to be revived.<ref>''Death of Doctor Strange'' #5.

Believing in Dormammu's promise of eternal life, Kaecilius and his Zealot followers proceed to destroy the Masters of the Mystic Arts' [[Sanctum Sanctorum (Marvel Comics)|Sanctums]] so Earth can be consumed by the Dark Dimension. However, [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Doctor Strange]] manages to convince Dormammu to renounce his attack on Earth while having the entity honor his promise to Kaecilius. Dormammu agrees to the terms and drags Kaecilius and his surviving followers into the Dark Dimension.<ref name="MarvelProductionBegins">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/25486/marvels_doctor_strange_begins_production |title=Marvel's 'Doctor Strange' Begins Production |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |date=November 24, 2015 |access-date=November 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125092911/http://marvel.com/news/movies/25486/marvels_doctor_strange_begins_production |archive-date=November 25, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="PreludeSynopsis">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/doctor-strange-prequel-comic-hints-at-movie-secrets-introduces-another-marvel-villain |title="Doctor Strange" Prequel Comic Hints At Movie Secrets, Introduces Another Marvel Villain |last=Couto |first=Anthony |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 6, 2016 |access-date=July 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721004814/http://www.comicbookresources.com/codesrv/be97611739e06314e4f58a47b545ee6b.20160630155726.css |archive-date=July 21, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Kaecilius">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/29811-doctor-strange-s-villain-female-lead-confirmed.html |title=Doctor Strange's Villain & Female Lead Confirmed |last=Marston |first=George |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=June 21, 2016 |access-date=July 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713133740/http://www.newsarama.com/29811-doctor-strange-s-villain-female-lead-confirmed.html |archive-date=July 13, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>
