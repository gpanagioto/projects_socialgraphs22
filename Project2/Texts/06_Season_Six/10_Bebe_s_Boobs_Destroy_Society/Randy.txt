Why? What's the matter with him? Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts. Hey there, son. Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan. Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life. But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever. I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most. If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no ''real'' power at all.
