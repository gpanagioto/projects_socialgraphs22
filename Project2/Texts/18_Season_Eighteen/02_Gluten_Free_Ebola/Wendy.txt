You're... back?  Oh wow, I'm shocked. You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams". Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  "dripping in bitches"?! I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love!  Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot? So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes. You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it? Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people! Thought so.  Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off. You're so transparent, Stan. You wanna dance?
