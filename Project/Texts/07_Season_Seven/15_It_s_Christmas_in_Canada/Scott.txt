 Hey! What the hell is going on?! Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!  A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now! This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!!   Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!  Ey! What are you doing?! What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?! You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you! Who the hell are you?! Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!!  Not so fast!  Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?! Haha, you lose, Americans!
