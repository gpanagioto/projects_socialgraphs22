Well that's ridiculous! We, we can't all buy that much candy! Let's just get rid of those scooters! Heh hey Randy. Linda and I, we... we were talkin' about how we never see you guys anymore, and we were thinking we'd hang out with you for Halloween, heh. Well, that, and we really wanna hang with you guys. Then please, Randy, can we just borrow a little candy? Please, Randy, the stores are all out! Just a few Milky Ways to get us through the first couple hours, please! We can cut 'em up. We can- we can hand them out little pieces at a time. It's okay, Linda! It's okay! On Halloween night, I'll... I'll just one of those e-scooters myself. I'll go around and, and I'll trick-or-treat. I'll... I'll get a bunch of-  I'll get a bunch of candy, Linda, and I'll bring it back to our house for us to hand out! It's going to be okay.  Trick or treat! Happy Halloween! Trick or Treat! That's not true! Yes I do! I'm Megyn Kelly! Now trick or treat!
