You know what the problem is? It's the schwag. All those stands and seeds, they just go to waste, man. It's like, we sell all the good parts of the weed, but we throw away, like, tons and tons of all the leftover shit. You can sell that crap as mulch to a hardware company. Even if we only get 10 cents a pound, we have like a million pounds of it. Yeah, I'll take some onion rings.  Best burgers I ever had. You sell hamburgers here. Did you find anyone else to take 'em? What?! How are we gonna do that? Yeee-haw!
