 Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately? Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing? Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  imagination. Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine?  Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.  Ubeuh... uh... n... no? Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here. This... is Imaginationland.  Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun!   No! It's just a Care Bear!  They're going something to Rockety Rocket. The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier! The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side!  Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!! That was your plan to stop them?? That's fucking stupid!  
This... is Imaginationland.  If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out!  Come on, wake up, kid! NO! You passed out and peed your pants! Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!  Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times. NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke!  Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope! Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain!  
 Oh look, I'm back! The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again. Whatever you imagine to be real, is real.
