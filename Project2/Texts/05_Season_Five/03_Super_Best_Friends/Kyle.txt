That's pretty cool, dude! He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass. Wow, that's cool! Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe! "David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.  I'm not really happy.  My potential hasn't even been reached.  Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine. We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four.... So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.  You're Stan? Where's Kenny? I'm Kyle.  What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff. But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow. What are we doing? Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere. It's ''not'' stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something. Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man. I'm not going anywhere! Huh? I thought you wanted to leave. You're Stan. Then I guess... I'm a dumbass.  Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore.  Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you. That's right. ...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square. David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you! How many tickets can we put you down for? Great! That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver. I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a-  This is a really good turnout. Dude, no way!  Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist. Yeah. Why is ''that'' good news? Mass suicide?  Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman! It's just me. Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore. I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad. I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too. Okay. Okay, you're right.  What have you done, Cartman?!  Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale! Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this! Cartman, no!  You bastards!  Stan! I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water!  Wagh.  Thanks for saving us Stan. You're ''my'' Super Best Friend.  Haha, hehahaha.
