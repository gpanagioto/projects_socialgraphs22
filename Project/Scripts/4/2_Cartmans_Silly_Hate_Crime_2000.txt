South Park Elementary, Monday during the day. The kids are out on the playground. The camera pans to the right, showing kids on the hobby elephants, the swings, and the jungle gym. It rests on Butters holding a starting flag.

Butters

Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?

Sledder

[three teams of four boys apiece] Ready!

Butters

On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! [the teams head down the small hill, and Cartman's team finishes first]

Stan

We win again! [all get off their sleds]

Tolkien

That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!

Cartman

Ey! Don't call me fat, Tolkien!

Lizzy

We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!

Stan

Sleds are for guys.

Cartman

Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!

Lizzy

These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!

Stan

Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.

The rest of the boys

Yeah!

Lizzy

I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!

Kyle

Oh yeah?!

The Girls

Yeah!

Cartman

We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!

Lizzy

How about a race down a real hill, then?!

The Girls

Yeah!

Stan

You got it!

The rest of the boys

Yeah!

A few others

Yeah!

Lizzy

Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!

Stan

No problem!

Lizzy

Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!

Kyle

Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!

Lizzy

See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!

Stan

Oh, boy! We'll show them!

Butters

Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!

Clyde

Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.

Tolkien

Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!

Cartman

Tolkien, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time [walks to a rock and picks it up] I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! [Kyle draws near to Tolkien]

Kyle

Fatass.

Cartman

There! [chucks the rock and it knocks Tolkien down]

Tolkien

Oh! [falls face first into the snow. Kyle is stunned that Cartman followed through]

Cartman

[sees what he's done] Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.

-----


Mr. Mackey's office, some time later. Eric and Tolkien are seated inside. Tolkien's right arm is in a sling and his right eye is blackened

Mr. Mackey

And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?

Liane

Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?

Cartman

[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Mom.

Liane

Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!

Cartman

[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Tolkien.

Mr. Mackey

Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric.

Cartman

Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? [drops from his chair] The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. [turns and heads for the door] See ya later.

Mr. Mackey

[raises his index finger] Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!

Cartman

No way!

Mr. Mackey

Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- [the door opens and two suits enter]

Man 1

Counselor Mackey?

Mr. Mackey

Yes?

Man 1

I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with [with gravity] the FBI.

Agent Keen

We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.

Mr. Mackey

Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention.

Agent Sharp

I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered [close-up] a hate crime. [Everyone all stares at Cartman]

Cartman

...What the hell is a hate crime?

Mr. Mackey

Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-

Agent Keen

New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense. [Everyone all stares at Cartman again]

Cartman

What? A federal offense?

Mr. Mackey

Oh no.

Cartman

Oh no??

Agent Keen

We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol. [grabs a hold of Cartman] Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in the federal court of law. [the two agents walk out with Cartman]

Liane

Oh my goodness.

-----


Trial TV, Tuesday. The letters fly into place over blind Justice holding the scales

Announcer

The hate crime trial of the century is underway [Cartman is shown] on Court TV tracks U van. [Tolkien is shown]. Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith.

Leslie

What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom [the courthouse is shown] as the defendant takes the stand.

-----


The courtroom. The prosecutor grills Cartman

Prosecutor

Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of "Tolkien?"

Cartman

Uh, yes?

Prosecutor

Who is Tolkien?

Cartman

He's a black kid that goes to my school?

Prosecutor

[outraged] Black?! Did you say black?! You called him black?!

Cartman

He is black.

Prosecutor

O! [turns to the audience]  He said it again! [the audience gasps] He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!

Cartman

I did?

Prosecutor

The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!

Cartman

No! I hate hippies!

Prosecutor

What?

Cartman

I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!

Liane

[behind the defense area] Oo, poopiekins?

Prosecutor

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This "monster" committed a crimeâ€”not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!

Cartman

[off camera] Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!

Prosecutor

[faces the audience and judge] The prosecution rests.

Lizzy

[walks in with Bebe, stops next to Stan and Kyle] Don't forget: we still have that sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters. [turns around and walks away]

Stan, Kyle

We know!

Stan

Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.

-----


The courtroom, some time later. A verdict has been reached, and the Judge announces it.

Judge

Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one.

Cartman

No!

Judge

I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are! [Cartman stares blankly back at the Judge, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Court is adjourned! [gavels one last time.]

The girls

[Bebe, Lizzy, and Red jump for joy.] Woohoo! Hooray!

Judge

Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall.

Black bailiff

Yes, sir. [they turn to face Cartman]

White bailiff

Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go? [Cartman has disappeared, leaving a fallen chair behind]

-----


Kenny's house. Cartman rushes up to it and pounds on the front door. Kenny opens the door

Cartman

[jumping excitedly] Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!

Kenny

(What the fuck for?!)

Cartman

They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!

Kenny

(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)

Cartman

[slaps Kenny] Calm down, Kenny!

Kenny

(Hey!)

Cartman

Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!

Kenny

(Yes.)

Cartman

Well, come on! I don't have much time! [heads for the garage. Outside, the garage door opens and a tiny truck creaks out with Kenny at the wheel and Cartman in the back seat]

-----


News Flash: "High Speed Chase"

Anchor

A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?

Greg Nimins

["NEWS 4 LIVE!"] Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him [in a single line, creeping] but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway. [Kenny takes a transition road off to his right] Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about.

-----


In the Go-Go Action Bronco

Cartman

Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!

Kenny

[looks back] (Why don'tcha keep your head down?!) [Cartman ducks]

-----


back to the report

Greg Nimins

Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading. [they have also enlisted the fire department's help] This could be the final stand-off.

Policeman 1

[holds his hand up for a halt] Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up. [the Bronco keeps going] Just bring it to a stop and come on out. [the Bronco keeps going] Jeezus, he's gonna ram it! [the officers dive for cover and Kenny pushes into the two cars blocking his way. Slowly, tons of steel give way before the puny Bronco, and Kenny and Cartman break through the blockade. The Bronco leaves and the officers get up.] Crazy son of a bitch.

-----


News Flash: Continuing coverage. Stan and Kyle watch the news flash at Stan's house

Greg Nimins

Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended. [eight cars are shown in four rows of two following the little Go-Go Action Bronco.]

Kyle

What the hell are they doing?

Greg Nimins

The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.

Stan

Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?

Kyle

Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. [the camera zooms out to show two lines of police cars following closely behind Kenny and Cartman. At least 22 cars are shown]

-----


The Arizona desert

Cartman:

We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico! [the little Bronco crawls to a dead stop.] Oh, God dammit! [the police cars rush in and the first one bumps the Bronco down the road. The others run into the first one and pile on. A few cars fly over and crash]

-----


Stan's house. The phone rings

Stan

[answers] Hello?

Lizzy

Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!

Stan

Son of a bitch!

-----


A truck arrives at the main gates of a prison in the desert. The gates part and the truck enters

Driver

Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.

-----


A clown face greets the truck and the double doors open. Officers line up and Cartman gets a good look at the inmates. Two kids are using weights, a third sits brooding, an angry African-American boy stands next to another brooding kid. Four kids play basketball, with the blond one having blood in his hair. Two kids play tic-tac-toe, and two others play tetherball. Cartman looks again and sees a sign saying, "Gruffy Bear sez: Try to escape and we'll shoot you where you stand." Two soldiers pace the catwalk above. Cartman looks again, and three boys beat a fourth over a football. A kid in nothing but briefs puts on airs while smoking. Cartman looks again and three babies play with blocks under an officer's semiautomatic. The babies are chained to each other

-----


A few moments later, and Cartman is in an orange prison suit being admitted

Warden

Prisoner 24601, arriving. [Cartman enters holding some bedding] Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500. [leads him in] Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband. [they pass through a security door into the mess hall] At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper! [the other kids look up and gasp]

Cartman

Huh-who's Romper Stomper?

Romper Stomper

[steps into the aisle] I am! [His feet are shown with yellow pails underneath them. Cartman turns, and a menacing kid with a teardrop tattoo under the left eye looks back at him] And I don't want no new cellmate!

Warden

[Cartman hides behind him] You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!

Romper Stomper

Oh, I will! [steps forward on his pails] You bet your ass I will.

-----


Wednesday, Phil Collins Hill, practice run. Elevation: 9436 feet. The boys in the class are gathered at the summit with Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Phil Collins' face is the hill's defining geographic feature

Stan

Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.

Kyle

Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. [The others look around at each other]

Stan

Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?

Butters

...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.

Clyde

Huh?

Kyle

Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.

Clyde

I'm not fat.

Stan

Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.

Kyle

Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!

Clyde

[sits on the back end of the sled] Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.

Stan

Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! [he, Kyle, and Kenny push off and then hop on as the sled picks up speed. The rest of the kids cheer them on]

Kyle

[as the sled stops] Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.

Lizzy

[her team's sled passes the boys by] See you Saturday, poo sniffers!

Stan

[looks back at Clyde] Nice going, fat boy!

-----


Alamosa Juvenile Hall. Some of the kids gather around Cartman.

Romper Stomper

Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!

Inmates

Yeah!

Cartman

Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.

Romper Stomper

Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!

Cartman

Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?

Romper Stomper

[after some thought] ...Neither do we

Cartman

[softly] Oh, thank you, Jesus. [normally] So we're friends now?

Romper Stomper

No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in "friends."

Inmates

Yeah!

Cartman

Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.

Romper Stomper

Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.

-----


Phil Collins Hill, second practice run. Kyle and Kenny add the finishing touches to something on the sled

Stan

Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks [points to them], but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!

Pip

Oh, that's a wonderful idea.

Clyde

So I don't get to be on the team now?

All the boys

Shut up, fatass!

Kyle

Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! [Clyde glares back]

Stan

Come on, let's get it a try. [he and Kyle get on, and Kenny starts the sled and gets on,]

Kenny, Stan

Woopee!

Stan

Yeah-

Stan, Kenny, Kyle

Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]

Stan

[to Kyle] Dude, bail! Bail! [they jump off, leaving Kenny with the brick rider. They end up face down]

Kenny

(Huh? Uh.) [the sled hits a rock, tossing him through the air] (AAAAAA!) [slams into a tree and sticks] (Ufff!) [the brick rider slams into him, killing him] (Ugh!)

Stan

[looks up] Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.

Kyle

We killed Kenny?

Stan

We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. [they walk up to the tree and stand in front of the puddle of blood]

Kyle

Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?

Stan

Nothing else is gonna work. [the rest of the boys converge on the tree] We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.

Butters

Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!

Pip

This is a sad day for men everywhere.

Stan

You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.

All the boys

Yeup.

Kyle

If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.

Butters

Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.

Lizzy

[arrives and steps off the sled] Woohoo. Great time, girls. [notices Kenny flattened against the tree] Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers! [walks away with her sled and the three other girls]

Stan

That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!

Some boys

Oh?

Other boys

[simultaneous] Huh?

Kyle

How?

Stan

I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.

Kyle

Sweet! Let's go!

The group

Hooray! Alright! Here we go!

-----


Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Thursday. Visiting hours 10:00 to 2:00. Relatives have come to visit the inmates

Mother 1

And have you been brushing your teeth?

Boy 1

Yes, Mommy.

Mother 1

And not dropping your soap?

Boy 1

Yes, Mommy.

Boy 2

Hi, Mom.

Mother 2

Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded.

Boy 2

Grounded? Oh, no! Um, wait... [Cartman has no visitors yet]

Guard

[leads Kyle and Stan to Cartman] Here you go, boys. Keep it short.

Cartman

Hey you guys.

Kyle

[he and Stan take their seats] Hey, fatass. How's prison?

Cartman

Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?

Stan

Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!

Kyle

Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. [lowers his voice] So we made you this cake. [lifts it onto the counter, and it reads, "Get Out Soon, Cartman"] There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.

Cartman

A what?

Kyle

[softly] An ailnay ilefay.

Cartman

Wwhat's that?

Kyle

Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!

Stan

Yeah, you stupid umbassday!

Cartman

I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here

Kyle

Stan

...Yeah.

Cartman

[a guard walks past him] Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?

Kyle

Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-

Cartman

Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!

Stan

Sshh! [the guard looks over]

Cartman

Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, [hushed] then I need those cigarettes.

Stan

How are we supposed to give them to you?

Cartman

Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.

Stan

But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.

Cartman

I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. [Stan and Kyle look at him and bust out laughing] Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!

Stan

Alright, here. [pulls some out and slips them through the holes one by one. The guard checks his watch and Cartman packs his ass]

Cartman

Well, okay... here... l'see...

Stan

Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.

Kyle

Me too.

Cartman

Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. [leaves the visiting area]

Kyle

Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. [he and Stan laugh]

Cartman

[at the door] Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. [the guard opens the door and Cartman walks in]

-----


Alamosa Juvenile Hall, outside the main gate. Stan and Kyle exit and Stan sets the cake on the ground.

Stan

That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. [pulls it out]

Kyle

So now what do we do?

Stan

There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!

-----


Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Cartman's cell. He enters

Romper Stomper

[reading a book, looks up] Well, did you get the cigarettes?

Cartman

Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.

Romper Stomper

Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. [Cartman does as told and starts groaning]

Cartman

Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. [groans some more until a plop is heard] There's one. [groans and screams until a second plop is heard] There's two. [more groans] Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh [plop] yeahhh. Hoh. Phew. [flushes the toilet and Romper looks up horrified] Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! [walks back to Romper crestfallen]

Romper Stomper

You flushed them?!

Cartman

Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.

Romper Stomper

No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.

Cartman

Son of a bitch!

-----


South Park, Friday during the day. Stan and Kyle get off a bus onto an affluent part of town

Kyle

Dude, I didn't know Tolkien lived so far away.

Stan

Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.

Kyle

Yeah. But isn't Tolkien the only one?

Stan

Yeah. [they walk up to the front door of a nice house. Kyle rings the bell]

Linda Black

[answering] Hello?

Stan

Hi. Can Token come out and play?

Linda Black

Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like. [the boys enter]

Kyle

Killer.

Stan

[sees Tolkien] Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?

Tolkien

No.

Kyle

Well then, [Tolkien begins to move away. Kyle holds his shoulder, but moves with him. Stan follows] you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!

Tolkien

Yeah.

Steve Black

I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys.

Stan

It's not?

Steve Black

No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor.

Kyle

Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit! [remembers where he is] Oh, sorry.

Steve Black

No, I'd, actually agree with you.

Kyle

Huh?

Steve Black

Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind.

Stan

Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?

Steve Black

Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.

Kyle

Why not?

Steve Black

Because I'm black.

Stan, Kyle

Oh.

Steve Black

Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws. [leads them away]

-----


Alamosa Juvenile Hall. Cartman is at the toilet pooping something else. Romper is reading

Cartman

[moans and tries until a small splash is heard] Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. [walks in with a box and tosses it on the ground] Here you go, God-damnit!

Romper Stomper

[tosses his book away and stands up] Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. [picks it up] Ew, it smells, man.

Cartman

Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!

Romper Stomper

You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!

Cartman

But you said-

Romper Stomper

I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?

Cartman

I thought that-

Romper Stomper

Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house. [walks to the cell door] Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw [Cartman, forsaken, begins to cry] Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess. [turns to Cartman] Hey. Uh, what are you doing? [Cartman cries some more] You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!

Cartman

I want my Mo-omm [cries some more and rubs his eyes]

Romper Stomper

Dude. [walks up to Cartman]

Cartman

Mommy, I want my Mommy! [continues crying]

Romper Stomper

Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here.

Cartman

You will?

Romper Stomper

Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland.

-----


The governor's office, day. An aide peeks in

Aide

Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?

Governor

Naw, not another committee. Send them in. [Stan, Kyle, and Tolkien enter. Kyle carries a boombox and Tolkien an easel with their presentation on it. They set up] This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?

Tolkien

Yeah.

Governor

Well, boys, what can I do for you?

Stan

[to Kyle] Okay, go ahead and start.

Kyle

I don't start, you start.

Stan

Oh, uhyeah. [walks to the easel and clears his throat] Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." [shows the title page. Kyle presses the play button for some ambiance] Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.

Tolkien

[flips a page to depict a stabbing in progress] If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.

Kyle

And we think that that is [flips the page to reveal a copy of the title page] a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?

Stan

[flips the page to reveal a person tagging City Hall] If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?

Tolkien

[flips the page to reveal a man being hit deliberately by a car] And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.

Stan

[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark] Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.

Kyle

[shows a rainbow of people holding hands] But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes [Stan flips the page to reveal their hate crime proposal]. For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we [flips the page to show them winning a sledding race] will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.

Stan

That is our presentation. An idea that we call...

Tolkien

[flips the page to reveal another copy of the title page] "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." [Kyle turns the tape player off]

Governor

Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.

Outside Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Friday night. Alarms sound and searchlights abound, indicating someone has broken out. Footsteps are heard, and Cartman and Romper climb over a hill

Romper Stomper

Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us! [Cartman runs ahead, Romper trips on a rock] Mph. Oowww!

Cartman

[turns around] What's the matter?

Romper Stomper

[looks up] It's my leg! I think it's broken. [looks back] You go on ahead without me.

Cartman

Uhokay. [turns and runs]

Romper Stomper

Hey. [Cartman stops and turns] You're supposed to say, "I'm not going without you," or something.

Cartman

Oh. Really?

Romper Stomper

Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.

Cartman

Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.

Romper Stomper

I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. [offers his pails]

Cartman

Okay. [retrieves them]

Romper Stomper

No! You're supposed to say, "I can't take these," or something, dumbass!

Cartman

Oh. I can't take these. [offers them back]

Romper Stomper

Take them. They'll bring you luck. [looks back again] Now go on. Get out of here. [Cartman turns, walks some, and returns]

Cartman

Romper?

Romper Stomper

Yeah?

Cartman

You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.

Guard

[shows up with other guards] Alright, freeze! [Cartman steps to Romper's side]

Cartman

You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!

Guard

But you've been pardoned by the governor! [shows the document]

Cartman

[takes it] O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. [walks away]

Phil Collins Hill, Saturday. The sledders are at the top of the run and other kids are at the finish line

Lizzy

[at the front of the girls' sled] Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!

Stan

Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.

Kyle

He's gotta show up. He's just got to.

Lizzy

Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!

Bebe

Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!

Kyle

Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.

Stan

Alright, where's Clyde.

Clyde

[steps up] Right here.

Stan

Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!

Clyde

For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! [realizes he's responded as Cartman would, and covers his mouth with both hands]

Kyle

On the sled, fatass!

Lizzy

Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!

Other girls

Yeah!

Butters

[steps into place with the starting flags] Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-

Cartman

[Butters looks up] You guys! [runs over a hill into view and races towards the group]

Stan

It's Cartman!

Boy Sledders

Hooray!

Cartman

That's right! I'm back! [Clyde walks over and hugs him, and he is surprised]

Clyde

Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back! [relief creeps in] Thank you so much. Thank you.

Cartman

What the hell's wrong with Clyde?

Lizzy

This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!

Stan

All right! Let's do this!

Butters

Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.

Cartman

I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.

Butters

Uh-get set. Go! [lowers the flags, and the girls shove off]

Cartman

Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.

Kyle

Go, fatass!

Cartman

When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-

Tolkien, Kyle, Stan

Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]

Stan

Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! [the camera looks at the slope. The girls come down first, then the boys]

Lizzy

We've got' em, girls!

Kyle

Oh no! The girls are gonna win!

Kids at Finish Line

Go! You can do it! Come on!

Stan

We're not gonna make it! [Cartman thinks, then he remembers.]

Cartman

Hey. [pulls out the pails and tosses them at the girls' sled]

Lizzy

G'aaaaah! [the pails gum up the reins. The girls' sled veers off the run and over a cliff. The weightlessness causes the girls and sled to separate, and all fall scattered on the ground below. A brown bear comes up]

Bear

Rowr. {carries Lizzy away]

Boy Sledders

[crossing the finish line] Hooray!

Stan

We did it!

Girls

Awww. [walk away disappointed, leaving only one blonde carrying a sign: GIRLS RULE]

Kyle

We won! We won!

Butters

Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!

Boys

Hooray!

Kyle

It's good to have you back, Cartman.

Stan

Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.

Cartman

Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.

Pip

Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass! [no one does. Cartman picks up a rock and throws it at him] Oh-ff. [falls on his face. The rock lands next to Cartman]

Cartman

Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?

Stan, Kyle, Butters, Tolkien

Naah.

Cartman

Sweet.

Alamosa Juvenile Hall, later, Romper's cell. He is reading

Guard

Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up! [Romper gets up] You got a visitor! [rolls the door aside and Cartman enters]

Romper Stomper

Eric!

Cartman

Hey, Romper Stomper.

Romper Stomper

Wow! I've never had a visitor before!

Cartman

Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.

Romper Stomper

You did? [Cartman goes to the door to make sure the guards are gone, then returns to Stomper]

Cartman

You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?

Romper Stomper

Yeah. [Cartman walks off to the toilet]

Cartman

[begins grunting. A few moments later, and a grin breaks out on Stomper's face. A big splash follows] Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.

Romper Stomper

Whoa! [end credits roll]

Cartman

Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. [splash. Romper is stunned] Ogh! Wait-

Romper Stomper

Oh, yeah!

Cartman

[grunts some more] Uh, what else? [splash] Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! [grunts some more, then, splash]

Romper Stomper

Oh, the monorail!
