===Earth===
The following Eternals reside on Earth:

* [[Ikaris]]<ref name="The Eternals #1">''The Eternals'' #1</ref> – A Polar Eternal, son of [[Virako]] and Tulayn, father of [[Icarus]]. Ikaris' birth name was Daedalus; he adopted the name "Ikaris" after his son, the [[Icarus]] of legend, was killed. He became Prime Eternal after challenging [[Thena]]. Under the alias of "Sovereign" he introduced the Eternals to the world as a team of super-heroes called the "New Breed."
* [[Ajak]]<ref>''The Eternals'' #2</ref> – Polar Eternal born to Rakar and Amaa, brother of Arex. With Arex, they were known in Greece as Ajax the Greater and Ajax the Lesser.

* [[Sersi]]<ref>''The Eternals'' #3</ref> – Manipulates molecules and atoms. Daughter of [[Helios]] and Perse. Sersi is the only Eternal who is a fifth-level adept at matter manipulation. She became famous in [[Greek Mythology]] through her encounter with [[Odysseus]]. Sersi prefers to live among humans and likes to throw parties. She became an [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] after [[Captain America]] asked her to transmute him so that he could go undercover as a teenager. She put herself into exile, but has since returned. She had romantic relations with Makkari and the Avenger [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].
* {{visible anchor|Domo}}<ref name="The Eternals #5">''The Eternals'' #5</ref> – Former Head Technologist at the Temple of Command in [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]]. Domo was extremely dedicated to his work, which involved monitoring all of Olympia's advanced systems. He was responsible for contacting Earth's Eternals when it was time to form the Uni-Mind. Domo was among the Eternals who left Earth in the form of a Uni-Mind. The starship ''[[Domo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Domo]]'' in the 2021 film ''[[Eternals (2021 film)|Eternals]]'' is named after the character.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Whitbrook |first=James |date=May 24, 2021 |title=Marvel's ''Eternals'' Trailer Breakdown: Who's Who and WTF Is That? |url=https://gizmodo.com/marvels-eternals-trailer-breakdown-whos-who-and-wtf-is-1846956785 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210530225042/https://gizmodo.com/marvels-eternals-trailer-breakdown-whos-who-and-wtf-is-1846956785 |archive-date=May 30, 2021 |access-date=August 20, 2021 |website=[[io9]]}}</ref>
* [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]]<ref name="The Eternals #5"/> – Superhumanly fast, son of Verona and Mara. Speedy and impatient, many Eternals don't take him seriously. In the 1940s, Makkari was the superheroes "Hurricane" and "Mercury." Later, he founded the [[Monster Hunters]] to fight [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] and joined the [[First Line (comics)|First Line]] as "Major Mercury." In the 2006 Eternals' series, he becomes the emissary of the [[Dreaming Celestial]].
* [[Thena]]<ref name="The Eternals #5"/> – Daughter of [[Zuras]] and [[Cybele]]. She was originally named Azura, but Zuras changed it to seal the bond with the Olympian gods. Often mistaken for [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]], [[Athens]] was built for her. She had [[Donald & Deborah Ritter|twin children]] in an affair with [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] and hid them, but became re-involved with her children after Dr. Daniel Damian tried to kill them. Briefly, she was queen of the Eternals. She has sought sanctuary with [[Heroes for Hire]] and the [[High Evolutionary]]. She also has a fully human son named Joey Eliot.
* [[Zuras]]<ref name="The Eternals #5"/> – Has developed his ability to project cosmic energy in various forms (heat, electricity, etc.) farther than any other eternal. He is the son of Kronos, brother of A'Lars, father of Thena, and husband of Cybele. Zuras was first Eternal to form [[Uni-Mind]] and was chosen to lead after Kronos' death. He was often mistaken for [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], so he made a pact with the Greek gods. He was physically killed when the Celestials defeated the Uni-Mind, but continued to exist in a spirit form. Zuras finally (and "completely") died while freeing Thena from a Brain-Mine. However, his spirit still seems to exist, as it appears occasionally in Olympia. In the 2006 series, he has been resurrected.
* [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]]<ref>''The Eternals'' #9</ref> – Has the appearance of a young boy. Adept at manipulating matter, with a particular focus on self-transformation. Sprite remained behind when Zuras called for Uni-Mind to examine the Celestials' Mothership. He is a TV star in the 2006 Eternals' series. He is killed by Zuras in the final issue.
* Aginar<ref name="The Eternals #11">''The Eternals'' #11</ref> – A Polar Eternal who disguised himself as an aide to Valkin in the guise of General Vulcanin of the Soviet Military. He doesn't care much for his Olympian Eternal "cousins." He was chosen to form the Uni-Mind, which has left Earth to seek out a higher meaning for their race.
* Delphan Brothers<ref name="The Eternals #11"/> – Team of [[boxing|boxer]]s from Olympia who enjoy getting into fights. They have little love for the Polar Eternals and once started a fight with them prior to the Ritual of the Uni-Mind. When Sersi refused to answer a summons to Olympia, [[Domo (comics)|Domo]] sent the Delphan Brothers to New York to force her return. She temporarily turned them into [[armadillo]]s for that.
* [[Druig]]<ref name="The Eternals #11"/> – Son of [[Valkin]], cousin of [[Ikaris]], sometimes known as "Druig of Nightmares." He was killed in a battle with Ikaris in the Polar Eternals city, but was resurrected. In modern times, Druig served as an agent of the [[K.G.B.]] in [[Russia]], enjoying the chance to inflict pain. Currently, he is the ruler of Vorozheika, a fictional former Soviet country.
* Master Elo<ref>''Quasar'' #12</ref> – Dwells in the Himalayas. Master Elo was the Eternal who showed Makkari how to channel his powers into increased speed.
* [[Kingo Sunen]]<ref name="The Eternals #11"/> – He is a samurai, master swordsman, film star and producer.
* Valkin<ref name="The Eternals #11"/> – Polar Eternal, father of [[Druig]], brother of [[Virako]], uncle of [[Ikaris]]. Valkin is known by some as the "All-Father" and served as the leader of the Polar Eternals. When Virako was slain, Valkin adopted Ikaris as his son. In the 20th century, Valkin assumed the alias of "Colonel Vulcanin" in the Soviet Military. Following the death of Zuras, many Eternals turned to Valkin as their leader, even though Thena was next in line. This leadership problem was resolved when Valkin chose to lead most of Earth's Eternals into space as a Uni-Mind.
* Zarin<ref name="The Eternals #11"/> – Polar Eternal who served as an aide to Valkin in his "Colonel Vulcanin" guise. Zarin also served as Valkin's pilot. He was among the Eternals who left for space in the Uni-Mind.
* Uni-Mind<ref>''The Eternals'' #12</ref> – A gestalt entity born of the collective energy of participants in the Ritual of the Uni-Mind. Eternals, Humans, Deviants and Brethren have been a part of Uni-Minds. Zuras was the first Eternal to form a Uni-Mind and used it to determine who should become 'Prime Eternal'. Since then, the Prime Eternal alone has the power to initiate a Uni-Mind. Following Zuras' death, a Uni-Mind was formed and left Earth. It contained most of the Eternals' population and apparently still exists—though Ajak, and possibly others, have left it.
* The [[Forgotten One (character)|Forgotten One]]<ref>''The Eternals'' #13</ref> – Has developed his superhuman strength and durability to a far greater degree than the norm for Eternals. He later joined the superhero team of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. His true name is not known. Over the centuries, he has been mistaken for [[Samson]], [[Beowulf]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Hercules]], and [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]. He also learned to rope from [[Buffalo Bill Cody]], fought alongside [[Achilles]] in the [[Trojan War]], fought with [[King David]] in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and helped [[Aeneas]] in his travels following the Trojan War. He was also responsible for cleaning the [[Augean Stables]], rather than [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. He befriended the Interloper, but otherwise, has lived mainly in solitude from the Eternals. He was captured by a being claiming to be [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]] and forced to train his Anachronauts, then he aged rapidly after he escaped. "Kang"/[[Immortus]] then sent an Anachronaut named Neut to slay him at Avengers' Mansion. In the 2009 series, he is living as a circus strongman who is manipulated by Druig into attacking other Eternals.
* Sigmar<ref>''The Eternals'' #17</ref> – Polar Eternal with an elderly appearance. He had at least two laboratories on Earth, one in Polaria and one deep below [[New York City]]. He created the Molecular Reassembler, the Dimension Cloud, and the Nerve Beast. Sigmar was one of the Eternals who left Earth in the form of a [[Uni-Mind]], with Phastos watching over his laboratories in his stead.
* Khoryphos<ref name="Eternals vol. 2 #1 1985">''The Eternals'' vol. 2 #1 (1985)</ref> – Eternal who has been mistaken for [[Orpheus]] and [[Horus]]. He is a musician whose current composition was started during the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]]. He met a Deviant woman, Yrdisis, who he fell in love with. He is able to use his [[mandolin]] to subtly control the thoughts of other people.
* Cybele<ref name="Eternals vol. 2 #1 1985"/> – Mother of [[Thena]] and the wife of [[Zuras]]. Cybele usually lives in a secluded forest in [[Colorado]] and does not usually take part in the affairs of her people, even though she was technically their queen while Zuras was alive. She has been mistaken for [[Gaea (comics)|Gaea]], Dyndymae, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and [[Agdistis]]. She aided the Eternals in a battle against [[Ghaur]] when he gained the power of the [[Dreaming Celestial]].
* [[Phastos]]<ref name="Eternals vol. 2 #1 1985"/> – Eternal who was often mistaken for the Greek god [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]]. He built most of the Eternals' devices, including the sword of [[Kingo Sunen]] and the flight harness used by Icarus. Normally, he lives and works in the [[Ruhr Valley]] of [[Germany]]. He  helped revive Virako and served as a member of the "New Breed" as "Ceasefire." He was reawakened by Ikaris when the Eternals lost their memories. Later he helped Thor in battling the Deviants and decided to stay in Lemuria to help the deviants with their loss of fertility. He cares more about things than about people. The hammer Phastos carries has the power to manipulate machinery in ways the Eternals' own matter control powers can not.
* El Vampiro<ref>''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]]'' #290</ref> – Eternal who masquerades as a [[vampire]] in his role as a [[luchador]] in Los Angeles. He has a human wife named Maria. He was prevented from answering the call to the [[Uni-Mind]] during the Fourth Host when the Deviant El Toro Rojo assaulted him and injured him badly.
* Interloper<ref>''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #147 (Jan. 1986)</ref> – Polar Eternal who normally lives in seclusion in a cabin in [[Siberia]]. The only fellow Eternal that the Interloper has truly befriended is the [[Forgotten One (comics)|Forgotten One]], who has also lived a life consisting mainly of solitude. Interloper died in battle against the [[Dragon of the Moon]] by transferring his life energy—forming the "Dragon's Circle" with some of the Defenders who were fighting with him (Valkyrie, Andromeda and the team's former foe Manslaughter)—into a blast of power that destroyed the Dragon of the Moon. He was later resurrected by possessing the body of student Will Fanshaw and transformed it into a replica of his own form.
* Virako<ref>''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Annual]]'' #7</ref> – Father of [[Ikaris]], brother of Valkin, husband of Tulayn. Virako is a Polar Eternal who participated in his people's missionary work to the America's cultures. He was mistaken by the Aztecs as [[Quetzalcoatl]], and by the Incas as [[Viracocha]]. He became a good friend of the Asgardian Thor but died in a battle with the Deviants. He was later resurrected but he didn't like the changes in Eternals culture
* Arlok<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #27</ref> – The Eternal chief engineer dissected by the Kree. The knowledge the Kree learned from dissecting Arlok was instrumental in creating the Inhumans.

They next moved to [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], after their craft was damaged by the [[Kree]]. Uranos died on Titan when his own people went to war while incited by the Dragon of the Moon, but his cruelty lives on through his great-nephew Thanos via his attempts to murder everyone.
