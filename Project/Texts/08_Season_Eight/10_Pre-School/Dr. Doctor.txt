From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride. We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure. Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life!  Get a cold towel on that pink belly! Over there!  Another wet willie? Give the poor kid some morphine.  Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl. It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.
