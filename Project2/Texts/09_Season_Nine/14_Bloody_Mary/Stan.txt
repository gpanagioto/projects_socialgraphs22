 Wait. Where's my Dad? Yeah. Dad? Where the hell could he have gone?? Dad, weren't you watching? Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive? Why not just pull over? Dad, we're gonna crash! Aww, it's all warm!  This is sooo embarrassing. Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it? Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves? Oh Jesus.  Dad! What the hell are you doing?! Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore! What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?! Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now! Aww, Goddammit! Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?! No! You don't need another beer! Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple. Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here? Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease? No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less. No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself. Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.   Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?! Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!  What?? Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years! ... I'm eight! Where? I can't see.  Oh my God... Dad, let's just wait our turn. I just, my dad was- What?! No, Dad, people will see!  Dad, we're going back! Praise Christ. Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come. No, my dad doesn't drink. Dad, Dad, Stop! Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue. Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means ''you'' did it. That means ''you'' didn't have a drink for five days all on your own. No! Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all. Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within.  I've had a great teacher. No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart. All right! That's probably okay if you spread it out. I think you're pushing it. That's not disciprine. Dad!
