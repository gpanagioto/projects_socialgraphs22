This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff. Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! ''This'' is what really matters!  Oh-oh boy, what's she done now? She's such a train wreck!  For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it. We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest. Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone.  An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
