 Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes. And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions? No! No, Filmore! You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear? ''Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,<br>Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?<br>Hey, there,-'' Hey, watch it, ''fag''. I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word "fag". So piss off, you fag-shitter!  Well, they can't use "fag". Because you can't say "fag" unless you're a homosexual. No. See, you got beeped. That's right. Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about ''you'', Jimbo, you frickin' fag! You wanna make out or something? Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now! Is this still part of the show?
