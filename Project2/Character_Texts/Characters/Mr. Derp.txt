 Hello there, children. It's time for lunch-e-roo Chef quit. Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp.  When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp.  Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone.  Derp! Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!
