==Fictional character biography==
Eugene Patilio was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Vincent Patilio (the supervillain '''[[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]]'''). After several defeats by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Spider-Man]], which eventually landed him in jail, Vincent subsequently decided to retire and go straight.

Eugene dons his father's costume as the '''Fabulous Frog-Man''' in an attempt to be a crime-fighter.<ref name="Marvel Team-Up' 1983">''Marvel Team-Up'' #131 (July 1983).

Frog-Man has a tendency to capture villains simply by dumb luck.
