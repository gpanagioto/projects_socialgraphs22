Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit. All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy. Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary. Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate. ...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please? All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly. Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%. But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
