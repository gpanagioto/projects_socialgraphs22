'''Wotan''' is a mystical [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book|American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by Gardner Fox and Howard Sherman, first appearing in ''More Fun Comics'' #55 (1940). The character is a major antagonist to [[Doctor Fate]], serves as an [[archenemy]] to various incarnations.  

Orignially a woman of prehistoric times, the woman who would become Wotan was sexually assaulted by male members of her tribe. Turning to magic, she took revenge and became a god-like entity to her tribe while learning to extend her life through reincarnation and became curious about the source of cruelty in humanity. Evetually, in a male body, he adopted the "Wotan" name  based upon Germanic and Norse mythology and gain a lust for power and knowledge, putting them at odds with Doctor Fate and other magical characters.  After the [[The New 52|New 52]] reboot, the character was then moved Earth 2 universe with a similar background; named '''Karel Wotan''', she is cursed by Nabu when she arrogantly challenged the mystic sorcerer by turning her skin green so he can recognize her no matter whom she may reincarnate into. In a male body, he plots to usurp Nabu's power and is challenged by Earth 2's version of Doctor Fate, [[Khalid Ben-Hassin]]. The character's original incarnation would later briefly reappar in DC Rebirth. 

Wotan has appeared in several media, having been adapted in both ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' and ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series.

=== Pre/Post Crisis ===

The being now known as Wotan started out life as a [[Stone Age]] [[woman]] who was raped by someone claiming to be a servant of God. She studied the black arts and became such a powerful [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] that she was worshiped as a [[goddess]]. She later learned how to switch from body to body and then to direct her own [[reincarnation]], eventually becoming the [[male]] being now known as Wotan.<ref name="Doctor Fate #14">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #14. DC Comics.</ref> In the [[Golden Age of comics|Golden Age]], Wotan encountered first [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] and then the sorcerer known as [[Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson)|Doctor Fate]] where he became Fate's nemesis.<ref>''Secret Origins'' (vol. 2) #24. DC Comics.</ref>

At one point, he was pulled back in time with other JSA enemies by the time-traveller [[Per Degaton]] to assist in capturing the JSA and stop them from interfering in his attempt to change the events of [[Pearl Harbor]]. Wotan uses his magic aura to hold the JSA captive in caves beneath an island. The plan is foiled by the actions of the [[All-Star Squadron]]. When the Spectre is released from the aura and frees the other members, Per Degaton goes back in time, thus erasing everybody's memories of this event and returning them to their proper places.<ref>''All-Star Squadron'' #1-3. DC Comics.</ref>

During the second volume of ''The Spectre'' in the eighties, he tries to take over the body of the sorceress [[Zatanna]], but fails.<ref>''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #7-8. DC Comics.</ref> In the early nineties, Wotan discovers the [[temple]] where the last body of the being known as [[Yahweh]] - God Himself - lay entombed, still seething with mystical power.<ref name="Doctor Fate #14"/> While fighting the current Doctor Fate and the Justice League, Wotan enters the tower with the intention of absorbing the power, confronting God himself, and supplanting Him. Instead, he emerges blinded, his evil having been burned out by God's power. Declaring that Wotan will never menace anybody again, one of Yahweh's servants spirits Wotan away.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #15. DC Comics.</ref>
=== Earth 2 ===
In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of DC's continuity), Wotan is reintroduced in issue #9 of ''[[Earth-Two#The New 52|Earth 2]]'' as '''Karel Wotan'''. Her original incarnation once again as a woman, Wotan calimed to be  "the mage of an organization that seeks to augment its control of magic in the world" although this was later revealed to be a lie.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]]|penciller=[[Nicola Scott]]|inker=Trevor Scott|story=The Tower of Fate: Prologue; The Man Who Was Scared|title=[[Earth-Two#The New 52|Earth 2]]|issue=#9|date=April 2013}}</ref> She is portrayed as an ancient sorcerer who started life as a female Viking and later mastered the arts of sorcery having lived several lifetimes, both male and female. An encounter with Nabu the Wise left her skin forever green and unable to enter the Tower of Fate which held the helmet Wotan desperately sought after.<ref>''Earth 2'' #11. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to centuries of sorcerous studies, Wotan is a master sorcerer and whose forte is black magic. Among their capabilities in magic includes dimensional travel, spell-casting, and has the power to transfer their soul into another body, directing their own form of [[reincarnation]]. At the height of Wotan's power, he is powerful enough to directly challenge [[Doctor Fate]]. In addition, Wotan is a skilled and capable scientist, having created technology considered far more advanced than anything created in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Who's Who in the DC Universe #1 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1990}}</ref> 

However, Wotan possesses poor skills in hand-to-hand combat and instead relies on magical powers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe Vol. XXVI |publisher=DC Comics |year=1987}}</ref>

== Other versions ==
In ''DC Universe'', the continuation of ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', there is a character called Wotan II who is part of a group of alien children called the Injustice Army.
