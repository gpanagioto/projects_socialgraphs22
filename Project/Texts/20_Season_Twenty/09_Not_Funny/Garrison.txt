Who wants me to bomb Denmark? Mr. Slave, this is all very complicated, diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't just go bombing other countries. Oh I'm a bitch, huh? I happen to be President, bitch! I'm not scared, my advisors have told me that I... If I decide a military strike on Denmark is warranted, then I will... Oh  Bomb Denmark!  The TrollTrace building or the whole fucking thing! Whatever it is, get the missiles ready! Yeah, yeah. Bomb the shit out of them. We have to be tough here. Oh geez. What does Kyle want. This is the President Oh, for Pete's sake, Kyle. Kyle, this is all very serious diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't understand the political complexities involved here. Excuse me? Who told you that? Kyle, I am the President. Oh that's what people think, huh? Well, maybe I won't bomb Denmark. What do you think about that?  Hold up! Hold up on the fucking bombs a minute!
