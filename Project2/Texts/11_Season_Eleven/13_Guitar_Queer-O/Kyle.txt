Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero. Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating.  For reals?  Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials.  Oh my God! ''Do'' we? He's a legend!  Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool. D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that? Oh, okay. Cool.    Who is this? Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan? But it's our game. We bought it together. Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?! I ''have'' been sick!  I'm not done yet. No. You're thinking of somebody else. Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Can I get a Fresca, please? Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters. I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet. Thanks, Mick. What are you doing here?  Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five.  Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities!  Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship!  You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore!  It was pretty fun, wasn't it? Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway. I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all! I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec? Thanks, Mick!  Goddamnit... Goddamnit.
