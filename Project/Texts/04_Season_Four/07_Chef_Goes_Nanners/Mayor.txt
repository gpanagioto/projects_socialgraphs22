Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?  Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again! Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.   Oh, boy. Oh brother, what now?! Ooh, Jesus. What a mess. Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.   Well, ''some'' people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this? Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday! What? This ''has'' been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.
