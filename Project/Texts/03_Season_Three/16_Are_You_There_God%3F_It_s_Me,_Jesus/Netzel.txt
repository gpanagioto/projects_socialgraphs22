Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park.   But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us! ...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus. Well, it's "The Millennium". ...''I'' don't know.  Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me.  Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event. How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night? Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as "the gayest party ever." Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
