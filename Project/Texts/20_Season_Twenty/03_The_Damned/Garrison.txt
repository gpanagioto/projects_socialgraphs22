Everyone, I need to just speak from the heart here. Uhm, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I've gotta come clean. Uh, I had no idea I would get this far,  I'm a sick, angry little man. Please, if you care at all about the future of our country, vote for her. Okay? She's the one who at least has some experience. She, she's not as bad as you think, I promise. And unlike me, she's actually capable of running this country.  Okay, look, look, just, vote for her, she... she knows politics. She really wants to put this country first. Would you just please shut up? Get out of your own way.  She doesn't mean what she's saying. She just doesn't know how to take this because... it's very weird and her advisers probably t- Fuck, oh fuck, why the fuck does it have to be her? I am so fucked. America, please listen to me. I have no idea how to be President. I am a complete jackass, and I have made a giant mistake here.  Nononono, nononono, why are you clapping? I'm not a good person for the White House. I am not a good person, period. I am peeing my pants... at the thought of being President, okay?  You don't want a guy like me in the White House! You don't even wanna know the shit I've done! I have scissored with another woman when I had a sex change! No, no! I'm not the guy you want going to Russia to negotiate with Putin. I'll probably end up gettin' drunk and tryin' to suck his dick.  OHHHH JEEEZ I hate all of you so much. 	I seriously hold so much contempt for each and every one of you pieces of shit.  I don't wanna be here. Please just let me go. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything. I'm scared. I'm completely clueless how to proceed. I just... spew bullshit and cry myself to sleep at night. Stop thinking that I'm anything more than a douche in over his head. For fuck's sake, please.
