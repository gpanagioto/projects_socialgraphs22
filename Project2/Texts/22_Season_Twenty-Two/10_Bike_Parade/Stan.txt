Dude, we did it. You're not gonna do the bike parade? Commodity fetishism? Come on, Kenny, don't be a dick!  Don't shoot up the school. How's it going? Our bikes aren't so bad. I thought the four of us were unstoppable. What? How do we get the bike parade cancelled? Hey, yeah. We can go to the Mayor and force her to cancel it. Yeah! First thing we've gotta do to get the bike parade cancelled is raise awareness. We sure do, Santa! Nononono! Wait wait wait, please! I mean, are we supposed to just keep going? Just go on, making total asses of ourselves?  Yeah! What? Did we think this was a fucking joke? The bike parade is offensive, and the government thinks they can just force it on everyone! Mayor, we demand you cancel this bike parade! It's him.  No! I guess they are offensive.
