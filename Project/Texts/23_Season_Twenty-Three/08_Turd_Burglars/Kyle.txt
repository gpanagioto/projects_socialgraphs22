A bacterial infection? In her stomach? So what can you do for her? Ike, if Mom lives, we can't let anyone ever know about this. Yes! Yuch.  Yeesh. Eewww! Aaagh!   Aaah! Do you guys have any idea what I'm saying?! Half the cells in our bodies aren't human! Right now there are alive creatures in your eyelashes and in your teeth! So?! Right now, that straw has a bunch of little bugs and they're going in your mouth and mixing with trillions of other little bugs that are alive inside you! You aren't even totally you! Okay, guys, listen. My mom had a fecal transplant. Why? What?! Eww! No! That is disgusting. Absolutely not! What is MY problem?! I'm not gonna go steal my mom's shit! I said "no", and that's final! The fuck are you doing?!  You are NOT stealing my mom's shit! It just freaks me out, Doc. [the doctor listens to Kyle breathing and heartbeat] We all have these... things... living inside our bodies, and everyone just seems fine with it. It's like, as soon as people learn they have microbiomes, the first thing they want to do is start swapping them. But where does it stop?! Then, are people just gonna start wanting skinny people's microbiomes to be skinny? Or an athlete's microbiome to feel athletic and young again? Well like, what about Tom Brady's poop? I'm just saying that Tom Brady seems to work really hard on his diet and stuff. His shit must be pretty good. [uncomfortable from the hard stare] What? The bookcase. [presses a button on the panel in front of him and the bookcase recedes and opens up, revealing a vault full of Tom Brady's poop in mason jars.] I didn't know. My microbiome did. All along they were trying to tell me something. I really learned that I'm not just me. I'm also all the creatures inside of me. From now on, I'm gonna trust my gut a little more. [pats his belly]
