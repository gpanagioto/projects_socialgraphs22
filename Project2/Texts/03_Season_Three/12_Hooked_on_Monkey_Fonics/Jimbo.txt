Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks. Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, ''always'' bet on the Jew. What?!  Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee! You can do it, kid! You can do it! You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh! Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds? You what?? See ya, Cotswolds.  Thanks for stopping by.  Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole! Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape. Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole! Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!
