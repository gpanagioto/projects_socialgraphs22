Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people <i>[she walks to the group and smiles]</i> for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame <i>[she frowns]</i>, but please, give her your full attention.  Go ahead. <i>[angrily]</i> Eric Cartman, you say ‘’excuse me”! <i>[to the choir teacher]</i> Go ahead. Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! <i>[to the choir teacher]</i> Go ahead. Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! <i>[sighs deeply and tells the choir teacher]</i> Go ahead. All right, that does it!!
