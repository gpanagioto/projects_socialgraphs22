'''Beautiful Dreamer''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Her real name and past prior to joining the Morlocks are unknown. She followed the terrorist Morlock leader [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] for a time and committed criminal acts by manipulating others with her mental powers at his behest. However, Beautiful Dreamer's primary motivation for doing so, as with most of her fellow Morlocks, is presumed to be her desire for company and community. 

Dreamer appeared in the first season of [[The Gifted (season 1)|''The Gifted'']] played by [[Elena Satine]].

When the Morlock leader Callisto had left for a time, [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] decides to re-implement Annalee's desires.
