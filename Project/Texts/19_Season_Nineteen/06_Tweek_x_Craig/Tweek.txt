What?  What is going on, huh? Huh? Me and him aren't together. Why is this happening?! Everyone thinks I'm gay! What if my parents find out! Huh! I'm not either! What's that? Gah! NO! Craig, can I touch your penis? No. Oh God.  AAaaagh! You're the one with the fuckin' problem!  You'd better not fuckin' push me again, man! No, no! What are you doing here?  There's no stopping it! The whole world wants me to be something I'm not! What?? What?! Are you insane?! The way everyone-! Like acting? No man, that is way too much pressure! I'll fail- Agh. I'm a terrible actor. Oh gah-okay. Oh God! What? Why not?  We don't belong together? What suddenly changed, Craig? Uh huh. And who the hell is Michael?! Huh?! You wanna tell me that?!  I went through your phone when we went out last night, Craig! I saw your texts to Michael about hooking up with him! Oh, it's not? Oh, don't use that lame shit on me, man! You don't wanna feel bad, so you try and tell me what I want?  Noho, you're not the bad guy! You're never the bad guy, are you?! You, you just step on people and you use them! Agh-I'm going too far?! What is wrong with you? Well, guess what, Craig! Love doesn't follow a plan!  Hi, is Craig here, sir? Hey, dude. I thought when we broke up everything would get better. I was thinking maybe we should say we're back together. What does that have to do with anything? You said to make it seem real. I'm so sorry, Craig. You, you made me believe in myself in a way I never have before. I didn't think I had any of that in me, but... you were right. I can do more than I think. You... changed something in me and I just... I wanna fix whatever's hurting you now.  Alright Craig. Alright.
