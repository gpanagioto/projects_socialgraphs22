Eric Cartman,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Eric_Cartman,,"In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", Cartman pretends he has [[Asperger's Syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]] by placing multiple hamburgers in his butt. He gave one to Kyle who liked the burgers a lot. Cartman then started a hamburger business in which he placed multiple hamburgers up his butt to give them the taste Kyle loved. He was later found out about this and his business was forced to shut down. This violates the Pure Food and Drug Act because Cartman put hamburgers up his butt and the sold them to customers. Since the burgers were up his butt, they were contaminated and might had some bacteria and E Coli in them, which is known to make people very sick. Some of the kids who ate the burgers might have gotten sick and some customers might have died from E coli. He does this again thrice in ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"" when he spiked laxatives into several cupcakes and tricked several students into eating them. He even does this in the same episode when he made the school faculty spike laxatives and horseradish into pizza in order to make the entire school crap their pants. He also did this to Mr. Mackey in the hallway and made him crap his pants and fart his whole body across the hallway.
*'''Piracy''': In ""[[Fatbeard]]"", he assembled several groups of Somalian pirates to plunder ships in increasingly aggressive ways, until all his pirates are shot to death by U.S. snipers. This crime in his criminal record is ignored by the government because they thought that Cartman was a hostage of the pirates due to his skin color.
*'''Breaking and Entering''': In ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"" and ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"", he broke into Kyle's room. The purpose for this was to steal one of the 3 triangles of Zinthar and give Kyle HIV. He also broke into the veal ranch in ""[[Fun with Veal]]"". Cartman also broke into several houses in "" [[About Last Night...|About Last Night ...]] "", in order to steal televisions.
*'''Credit Fraud and Identity Theft''': In ""[[Fatbeard]]"" Cartman steals his mother's credit card and uses it to buy plane tickets to Cairo for himself, Clyde, Butters, [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]], and [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]]. He also uses her Visa card to rent an [[E-Scooter]] in ""[[The Scoots]]"".
*'''Embezzlement''': In ""[[Probably]]"", Cartman starts his own church after he and the kids catch [[Father Maxi]] having sex in the church confessional with Clyde Donovan's aunt. Cartman made every kid in South Park into evangelists and asked for their money for charity. However, in reality, he was taking full advantage of them because he was actually taking all their money and was spending all of the supposed church money on himself. Therefore, it counts as embezzlement.
*'''Underage Driving/Hit and Run''': In ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"", Eric Cartman hijacked a race car and ran over several spectators and pit crew members, culminating in the deaths of eleven people. He later does this again, going off the race track and into a trailer campsite, presumably killing many people. In addition to all this, he purposely ran over another driver, Danica Patrick, on purpose after she was eliminated from the race.
*'''Resisting Arrest''': In ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", Cartman escapes from custody after being found guilty of committing a presumed hate crime. Cartman bribes Kenny to drive him to Mexico in his battery operated kiddie car and therefore puts the police in a wild goose chase with it ending near the U.S/Mexico borderline. He does this again in ""[[Casa Bonita]]"" when Sheila and the boys found out that Cartman selfishly kidnapped Butters and locked him in a bomb shelter, therefore scaring all of South Park so Cartman could go to [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]] for Kyle's 9th birthday. When Sheila says that the police were on their way to arrest Cartman for the kidnapping of Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch, Cartman runs into the restaurant and tries to avoid the police as much as he can while enjoying what Casa Bonita has to offer in the process. The chase therefore ends after Cartman tries one last ditch effort to resist arrest by jumping into a 20-foot waterfall only to get cornered and arrested.
*'''Child Abuse''': In ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"", Cartman made some babies diagnosed with fetal cocaine syndrome play a game of basketball with a bag of coke and videotaped it. This counts as child abuse, because Cartman was making a profit out of this and did not give the babies any credit, which counts as slave labor.
*'''Shoplifting''': In ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"", Cartman goes to a local grocery store with Butters in hopes of finding Vagisil there. While in the store, Butters forgets to bring money with him to buy the [[Vagisil]] because Cartman did not tell him to. Cartman then decides to ingest multiple Vagisil products in the store and then leaves without paying for the Vagisil.
*'''Blackmailing, Framing, False Evidence''': In ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", Cartman (a.k.a. [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]]) tries to blackmail [[Captain Hindsight]], in order to have him join the superhero team. He also framed Trent Boyett twice in ""[[Pre-School]]"" for arson and the assault of a teacher in order to get out of trouble and avoid his wrath for five years. He also commits blackmail in ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"" when he pressured Kyle into seeing the Passion Of the Christ and told him to have the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. However, this kind of blackmail was emotional blackmail because Cartman did not threaten Kyle with extortion or with a videotape or photos. Another example of his blackmailing is shown in ""[[Cancelled]]"" when the Joozian producers were caught having weird alien sex (They were sucking each other's jagons while high on alien drugs) in front of him and the other boys. Kenny takes a picture of the Joozian's doing this and Cartman takes advantage of this by using it as blackmail. However, this crime may not count because Cartman broke this law in another planet and was doing this in order to save Earth from being destroyed. Unfortunately, Cartman may be held accountable for this in the Intergalactic Justice system because he broke this law on another planet and may be an example of extradition. However, again, Cartman got his memory erased and could not remember anything about this blackmail at all. Also, in ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"", some people who had supernatural powers accused Cartman and his false ability of being a fraud and sued him. In order to avoid the lawsuit, Cartman intentionally framed this group of people for the murder of [[Veronica Crabtree]] and it caused the group to get arrested with one of their members killed by police. He even framed his mother in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"" after he found out that his family has the second lowest income in South Park. He engineered a plan to get himself into a foster home by creating a meth lab in his backyard and framing his mom for it, therefore getting her arrested. The police however found out about this later and arrested Cartman and placed him in jail for two months
*'''Torture''': In ""[[The Snuke]]"", he used farts to torture the Hakeem family. However this does not count as actual torture because Cartman does not use any weapons but rather his own gas to annoy and provoke the Hakeem Family. What Cartman did to the Hakeem family was actually government sponsored and therefore is not branded into his criminal record. Unfortunately, in ""[[Tsst]]"", Cartman kidnapped a student named Billy Turner and forced him to play a Jigsaw game. Cartman secretly spiked poison into Billy's lunch milk and handcuffed him to a school flagpole. Then, Cartman forced Billy to torture himself by cutting off his own leg in order to get the antidote.
*'''Fraud'''/'''Plagiarism''': In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", he replaces the words 'Baby' in love songs with 'Jesus', which is plagiarism, and fraudulent as the band is not technically Christian rock. He also pretends to be mentally disabled twice in ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"" and in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"". He also does this in ""[[Freak Strike]]"" when Cartman decides to go on the [[Maury Povich]] show and pretend to be an out of control teenage prostitute for the sole purpose of obtaining a valuable prize after Butters unintentionally scams him of one by appearing on the same show as a practical joke by the boys and with fake testicles attached to his chin.
*'''Rape''': In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", he gave Butters a blowjob (technically) without his knowledge, and puts Butters' penis in his mouth. It is also implied that he and his men raped women in ""[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]"" and ""[[Fatbeard]]"", but this is not proven.
*'''Forceful Confinement: '''During the events of ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", he (as 'The Coon') forces Butters to stay in a small jail cell in his basement. He also locked away 63 hippies in his basement in ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"".
*'''Contempt of Court''': In ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"", Cartman sues Stan for Sexual Harassment and then took full advantage of him in court. However, in this crime, Cartman was being used by Kyle's father Gerald Broflovski so he could make money by telling Cartman to sue [[South Park Elementary]] too.
*'''Vigilantism''': Due to Cartman's attempts at crime fighting in ""[[The Coon]]"" and his violent methods of dealing with crime, he is technically in violation of the law regarding vigilante actions. However, due to his constant ineffectual attempts, this is overlooked by South Park Authorities.
*'''Submitting False Evidence''': In ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"", Cartman uses the lie he made about [[Wendy Testaburger]] killing all of the Smurfs as the key plot device for his movie. He then uses the movie to frame Wendy by poorly dressing up as her and then doing the same thing he claimed that Wendy did. Not only did he provide a sneak peek for all of the students of South Park Elementary to see on his morning show, but he also released it on DVD and Blu-Ray to stores all across America. This lawbreaking led to the creation of the movie ''Avatar''.
*'''Slander''': In ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"", Cartman declared not only in general, but on national TV that his own mother Liane has ""fucked him"", all because she refused to let him have an iPad. While he is speaking figuratively, the audience and [[Dr. Phil]] assume him to mean it literally. In a slightly less liable manner, Cartman also slandered Wendy in ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"", he accuses her of being a slut, embezzling money from the school, genocide of the Smurfs and numerous other atrocities, but escapes legal liability by adding ""allegedly"" at the end. He also does this in ""[[The Snuke]]"" when he told the CIA that the Hakeem Family were a group of terrorists. However, this lie serves a very good purpose because Cartman ended up stopping the British from invading America because of that lie.
*'''Hitchhiking''': In '[[Imaginationland]]"", Cartman hitchhikes to Washington D.C to get Kyle to suck his balls, but in the State of Colorado, hitchhikers can face up to two years in prison.
*'''Theft''': In ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"", when the boys are building the ladder to Heaven, Cartman steals a seat from [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s car. Cartman mentions that Mr. Garrison did not throw away his car, so he obviously did not do it with permission.
*'''Child Pornography''': In ""[[Safe Space]]"" he tells Kyle, he has taken and published photo of his penis on the Internet. In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"" he also has in possession, and shares an image of Butters sucking his penis.

According to the creators, [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], they thought it would be impossible to put a character like Archie Bunker on late-20th century television. But then they came up with the idea that it might be allowed if the character were an animated nine (formerly eight) year-old boy living in the mountain town of [[South Park (Location)|South Park, Colorado]]. Thus, Cartman was born.Over the course of the series, Cartman managed to accomplish a wide range of achievements more than any other character of ''[[South Park]]''. Some of them are a success or failure:
Cartman is notable for having a very large criminal record. Although he has committed many atrocities and crimes, he has only been arrested seven times. He has been arrested for his mistakenly assumed hate crime, kidnapping Butters, framing [[Liane]] for operating a meth lab, being with Stan Marsh on ""[[Whale Whores]]"" (The prison Cartman went to for this assumed crime was Japanese), and incarcerating hippies. In ""[[Time To Get Cereal]]"" he, along with Kyle, Stan and Kenny, was arrested by [[Harrison Yates]] for assumed school shootings, which have been proven to be [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]]'s attacks. He was also arrested for the murders and terrorism of multiple people with Cthulhu, while under the disguise of the Coon, by Kyle, Kenny, Stan, [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], Tolkien and [[Timmy]], although they did not have the authority. Even then he was released almost immediately after his arrest. The real reason why Cartman does not stay in prison for a very long time is likely because his Mom bails him out, dismissing the severity of the crime. Another reason why because the town is too incompetent to do anything about it. Cartman's criminal record includes but is not limited to:

[[File:GingerKids (66).png|thumb|Cartman as a Ginger kid in ""[[Ginger Kids]]"".]]
''""You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman!""'' -Kyle, upon seeing Cartman manipulate the gingers into doing the opposite of what he had previously told them to do in ""Ginger Kids""

''""Yes, but at least I'm not going to die!""'' - In which Cartman, for once, agrees with Kyle, as he admits that he is manipulative, because that is likely what he does in almost every episode.

Cartman is often shown to be a poor student, but excels in leadership and team organization which usually involves exploitation of others' weaknesses. Although having his origins as a secondary role as the comic foil, Cartman has evolved into a character of stunningly articulate manipulative talents and techniques. His abilities are deeply Machiavellian in nature, and his character follows closely in the footsteps of other famous manipulators such as the character Iago from William Shakespeare's ''Othello''. In several episodes throughout the series, he employs this skill to get what he wants. His most frequent targets are adults and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], though he often targets other children for more personal purposes, including convincing Butters to ""take one for the team"" and be anally gang-raped by men from [[NAMBLA]] in ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", and repeatedly convincing Kyle that he is doing good, only to exploit Kyle's help later on. He talked the ginger kids out of killing all non-gingers after Kyle told him that they had played a trick on him in ""[[Ginger Kids]]"". Earlier in that episode, he had rallied all the gingers into a genocidal frenzy, convincing them that all non-gingers are inferior in a Hitler or KKK-esque way, as well as stage violent protests and march down the streets chanting ""red power!"". He then made them kidnap all the children in town and hold them in a cage over a pit of lava, but managed to convince them to stop when he was told by [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] that his case of ""[[Gingervitus]]"" was a prank. Along the same line, in ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"", he is able to rally all the members of the [[Mel Gibson]] fan club to march through the town while yelling, ""''Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!''"" (We must exterminate the Jews!). However, it should probably be noted that they were ignorant of the true meaning of this phrase, mistaking it for Aramaic. But given the fact that it caused a large argument in the middle of the city between his group and some Jews, and given the violent and ignorant nature of most adults in South Park, it would not be surprising if it had turned into violence if allowed to continue. Cartman was also shown smiling in the background at the argument, as if all was according to his plan. He also demonstrates great understanding of the human mind and the way to exploit it. In the episode ""[[Tsst]]"", Cartman was able to drive several nannies from his house with insults and insinuation (even causing one to be put in a mental hospital). In the same episode, he also made one child saw his own leg off in a reference to the movie ""Saw"".

Cartman is a good strategist, organizer and speaker. He devises elaborate plans to achieve his goals, sometimes presenting them to his friends using a whiteboard. In ""[[The List]]"", he comes up with [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail|a plan]] (and later [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time|a second]]) to get the [[The List/Trivia#The ""Fake"" List|girls' list]] into the boys' possession. In ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", when everyone else gives up playing [[World of Warcraft]], he devises a plan to defeat '[[Jenkins|the griefer]]' and successfully motivates the other boys to join him. In ""[[Fatbeard]]"", growing sick of school, he devises a plan to go to [[Somalia]] to become a pirate. He successfully convinces [[Pirate Club|a group of friends]] to join him and leads the ""expedition"".

Cartman's perceived stupidity by his friends can be attributed to his sometimes naive, careless behavior. However, his uncanny skill at manipulation, bilingualism, and ability to create elaborate schemes which are often effective imply a high intellect, despite his ignorance. Cartman seems to have no problem talking to people and speaking in general. He has an uncanny way with words and uses that to his advantage whenever he plots an idea. For example, in ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", Cartman delivers a speech to the United States House of Representatives convincing them to vote in favor of stem cell research. He also appears to be multilingual (though not very well).

He claims to be able to speak Spanish in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"", when he tells a [[Costa Rica]]n freedom fighter that he wants burritos, and in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"", he actually speaks Spanish to the Mexican workers hired to smear Butters home with excrement. In ""[[D-Yikes!]]"", Cartman again demonstrates his proficiency in Spanish when hiring Mexicans to write an ""essay"" (which the immigrants mistake for the Spanish informal word for a friend, ''ese'') on ''The Old Man and the Sea''. He is the only one of the children in South Park to speak Spanish fluently, as shown when kids go to him when they cannot understand people, although he is sometimes prone to grammatical errors, such as the previously mentioned example. In ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"", Cartman also speaks German, but most of his words are mispronounced, leading us to assume he only knew a few Nazi slogans. However, in ""[[Funnybot]]"", these assumptions were proven incorrect, as it was shown that he was fluent in German, with him proclaiming ''Dürfen wir der Kind dort...geboten? (We can offer the child ... here.) Er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. (He's a Jew. Eh? A handsome soft Jew. He's freeesh. And beauuutiful, beauuutiful.)''.

In ""[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]"", he exploited a controversy involving the appearance of Muhammad on Family Guy to try to get the show off the air; he pretended to be the hapless victim of an Islamic terrorist attack to try to discourage the FOX president and the Family Guy staff writers from airing the [[Muhammad]] episode. On another occasion he was able to convince the majority of the adults of South Park (as well as many people from other cities and the entire state of South Carolina) to nearly take over the U.S. via an out-of-hand re-enactment of the Civil War, as long as he kept them drunk so they would not realize what they were doing.

Cartman is also a very good leader as a pirate captain, in ""[[Fatbeard]]"", when he convinces all the Somalian pirates to join his crew, and causes so much trouble to international shipping that the United States Navy had to track him down and kill his crew.

[[File:ScottTenormanMustDie30.gif|thumb|left|The aftermath of Cartman's greatest triumph in ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"".]]
Cartman's shining accomplishment (according to [[Comedy Central]]'s list of ""Cartman's 25 Greatest Moments"") came in the episode ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", a testimony to Cartman's hidden ingenuity and cunning, as well as the full extent of his cruelty and mental imbalance. [[Scott Tenorman]] continually defeats Cartman's attempts at retrieving a sum of money Scott tricked him out of throughout the episode, humiliating Cartman and elevating his hatred and desire for revenge. Finally, Cartman gets the last laugh, as he indirectly coerces Scott's parents into a situation where they are trespassing, and are consequently shot and killed. Cartman then steals the bodies and makes them into chili which he promptly feeds to Scott. Cartman then coolly tells Scott how his parents died, hints at what happened to their remains, and inquires about his chili: ""''Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?''"". Scott is traumatized and horror-stricken, and Cartman gloats and laughs hysterically at the inconsolable Tenorman, while licking Scott's ""tears of unfathomable sadness"" off his face with intense pleasure. However, Scott discovered that Jack Tenorman was also his father, much to his shock, but not because he killed his own dad, but because he is half-ginger, ever since Cartman vowed to get revenge on Tenorman again and get the last laugh.

Cartman has also organized several groups of boys when rallying against his enemies, including an online griefer (in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"") and the girls on at least 2 occasions: Where he tries to obtain a ""future telling device"" in ""[[Marjorine]]"", and when he captures a list of what the girls declared the cutest guys in ""[[The List]]"", the boys following Cartman's plans. He is always the leader, and manages to lead all the boys in the group into success almost every time. Butters, Kenny, or [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] usually act as his right-hand man, and recurring members of the groups include Tolkien, Craig, Clyde, Kyle, Stan, Kenny, and Butters, but most of the time they (with the exception of Butters and sometimes Clyde) seem to realize how mentally imbalanced he is.

During the episode ""[[T.M.I.]]"", the psychologist started to criticize his obesity as a way to test his anger, as Cartman was suspected to have anger management problems. During the time of being yelled at, Cartman does not seem to demonstrate any angry response and simple allows the psychologist to curse Cartman's obesity, and even proceeds to sends a text message/e-mail on his iPhone in a non-concerned manner. Almost immediately on the psychologist receives a phone-call from his frantic wife, claiming that she moments ago received a police report about the psychologist having an affair with an under-aged girl. Confused, the horrified doctor hears her shoot herself with a gun over the phone, Looking back at his patient, Cartman says in a cold voice, ""I'm not fat, I'm big boned"". This cruel one-line comment along with the fact the supposed police report came from a ""[[Mitch Conner]]"" indicates that he was responsible for her suicide due to the doctor's remarks. This may echo the Scott Tennorman incident, stressing the importance of why it is not a good idea to provoke Cartman, as terrible consequences may ensue if you are not within his immediate ""circle of friends"".

Cartman has been shown to be an expert in the act of ventriloquism, as shown in ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", ""[[200]]"", and ""[[201]]"". It is also shown that Cartman sometimes uses his talent to express his delusional side, he demonstrates this through his hand, which he calls [[Mitch Conner]]. In ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", his hand has an affair with [[Ben Affleck]], gets signed onto a record company, and almost gets him killed by [[Jennifer Lopez]]. He seemed go through all of that solely for the purpose of tricking the rest of [[The Boys|the boys]]. Although, in ""[[200]]"", it is shown that [[Mitch Conner]] may be a real being, as he was shown to possess knowledge that Cartman did not.

Cartman is shown in ""[[T.M.I.]]"" to send a message to an anger management psychologist's wife in mere minutes, making it look like a police report; Cartman had to find the location / number of The Psychologist in order to send the message. Cartman is also shown to type very fast, as he wrote apparent emails about a teenage girl having a sexual affair with The Psychologist.

Throughout the entire run of the South Park series, there have been a few instances where Cartman spoke languages other than English quite well and he does seem to be fluent in Spanish and speaks very good German (for the sake of South Park). For example, in ""The Passion Of The Jew"", when Cartman dressed as Hitler, while rallying outside the theater presenting ""The Passion"" with a group of Christian followers, he began chanting hateful comments to Jews in German such as ""''Es Ist Zeit zu säubern''"" (""It's time to cleanse""), while the crowd replies """"''Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!''"" (""We must exterminate the Jews!""). Next, Cartman exclaimed ""''Es ist Zeit für Rache!''"" (""It is time for revenge"") and the crowd replies ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!"" (""We must exterminate the Jews!""). While Cartman did not necessarily pronounce the German words correctly, it was pretty clear that he understood what they meant in English and his followers did not.

In ""[[Pandemic]]"", the boys decided to start their own Peruvian band to earn some spending money. When they spotted a real Peruvian band ""stealing their spotlight"", after the other boys first confronted them in English and the band members continued to play as if they did not hear them (since they did not speak English), Cartman began yelling at them in Spanish, generally telling them to stop playing in their area. The band paused for a long second in confusion, then continued to play. This then prompted Cartman to repeat what he originally told them in Spanish and out of anger he even snatched one of their instruments away and threw it off into the distance.

Also, in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"" he spoke to Mexican workers in fluent Spanish, suggesting that he is, in fact, fluent or knows a few phrases. He also speaks French to Clyde in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"" as ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?"", or ""Would you like to sleep with me, Clyde?"". This, however, is a line from the song ""Lady Marmalade"", and considering the meaning of the phrase, likely means that Cartman does not actually speak French. Granted, there really has not been much focus on this particular talent of Cartman's (since most of the story plots do not focus on it) so there's virtually very little known as to how he learned these other languages so well at such a young age. It is possible that his mom Liane Cartman may have personally taught him the other languages, as was revealed in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"" when she purchased a educational game that helped Cartman to improve his spelling skills.

In ""[[Funnybot]]"", Cartman speaks German to the Germans, seemingly offering them Kyle as a way to make peace with them, or just kill him.

[[File:ChristianRockHard10.jpg|left|thumb|Cartman's cover for Faith + 1.]]
Cartman appears to be musically talented. He plays the piano quite well in the episode ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"" (although the piano plays by itself whilst he is singing so it may be a player piano and Cartman cannot play it), the violin in ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"", the French horn in ""[[Summer Sucks]]"", the drums in ""[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]"", the harmonica in ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"" and ""[[Whale Whores]]"", the recorder flute in ""[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]"", the acoustic guitar in ""[[Chinpokomon]]"", and pan flute in ""[[Pandemic]]"". He is shown to be randomly strumming a guitar and beating the drums so he is not too good at them.

His Christian rock group ""[[Faith + 1]]"" sold 1,000,000 copies of its album in the episode ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"" with the intent of earning a platinum album but according to the Christian Music Association their artists only receive Myrrh for this achievement.

In the film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Cartman is shown singing in mock versions of Chinese, French, Dutch and an unidentified African language by singing ""[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]"".

In ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"", Cartman sings, ""[[O Holy Night]]"" (despite several interruptions).

In ""[[Chef Aid]]"", he sings and does a German dance to raise money for Chef's legal fees.

He founded a boy band named [[Fingerbang]] in the episode ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"".

Cartman's musical tastes run toward progressive and arena rock in general and maudlin power ballads in particular. ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" shows for the first time that Cartman has the uncontrollable urge to finish singing Styx's ""[[Come Sail Away]]"" whenever he hears any part of the song, which he can do, under pressure, in 27 seconds (possibly a sign that he has a very minor case of OCD based on the fact that he mentioned it was not only songs he had to finish). In ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", Cartman sings ""[[Heat of the Moment]]"" to the United States House of Representatives convincing them to vote in favor of stem cell research. Cartman also appears to enjoy teen pop, as demonstrated in his [[Britney Spears]] dance sequence in ""[[AWESOM-O]]"". He also quotes, ""Haha charade you are"" from Pink Floyd's song, Pigs (Three Different Ones). During a scene in ""[[Whale Whores]]"" Cartman sings the Lady Gaga song ""[[Poker Face]]"" while playing the video game Rock Band with Kenny as the drummer. This song was later released as a real downloadable single for the game.

Cartman frequently bursts into song spontaneously, sometimes with melodies and topical lyrics of his own devising, although his musical talent is questionable. He often uses this skill in order to persuade others by using the song to manipulate their thoughts and emotions. This penchant for ''ad hoc'' songs was specifically mentioned in ""[[Ginger Kids]]"". This also happened in the episode ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"" when Stan asks Cartman to donate a kidney to a very sickly Kyle, Cartman replies by singing ""No no no no no no no no no no!"" to the tune of ""Comedy tonight"" from ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"".

In a mean-spirited feeling, Cartman begins singing an Elvis version of ""[[In the Ghetto]]"" when in Kenny's neighborhood, namely, the poor part of town.

For Rush's ''Snakes and Arrows'' tour, a short animated clip was made to introduce the song ""Tom Sawyer"", featuring the boys from South Park as a band attempting to perform the song. Cartman is featured as the lead singer (Geddy Lee). In ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"", he bursts into song, singing ""Kyle's Mom's a Bitch"" he also did this in ""[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]"", despite Kyle's repeated warnings.

Cartman has also been featured on several tracks on all three ''South Park'' albums.

Cartman knows a bit about Photography, as shown in a few episodes. In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", he demonstrates his knowledge of the nature of music artist's album covers, such as how the members of a band are mostly in random places looking in other directions and never smile. Also, in ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", Cartman takes up his hobby of inviting Butters over, just to take embarrassing photos of him. He is also shown presenting a slideshow in class, and comments about them skillfully. Also, in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"" and ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"", he is talking about how he should take his picture of Kyle sucking his balls. He even has professional help with his photo shoot in Part III. Also he is good at Photoshop, (though his art skills are very first grade like) as we can see from ""[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]"", when he is framing Kyle.

Cartman has been bad at sports, and sometimes good. He has been seen playing center in Football in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"" and on the Dodge-Ball team in the episode ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"". He plays Baseball, as he is seen hitting a home run and plays catcher on the Baseball team, as seen as one of the three players ([[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and Cartman) hitting a home run in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"".

In ""[[Grey Dawn]]"" he is seen playing street hockey along with the rest of the boys as a goalie. In later episodes ""[[ManBearPig]]"" and ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", Cartman is seen to be playing basketball with the other boys, however he is not nearly as talented as he seems to think or the others. He often cries out 'Stop cheating you black asshole!' when an opponent beats him, or 'You tricked me!' as if this was illegal. However, Cartman seems to have a grasp of cheating strategies (as seen in ""[[Eek, A Penis!]]"".) Cartman tries out for the wrestling team in ""[[W.T.F.]]"", but leaves after he is put into a ""gay"" move by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who was told by [[Mr. Conners|the teacher]] to do so. In the same episode he formed a wrestling league along with some of the other boys. However, the wrestling in which they performed was more dramatic theater in which they created complicated in depth story lines for their wrestling personas, rather than actual athletic prowess.

Cartman is also seen as a not very good swimmer in ""[[Summer Sucks]]"". Cartman is upstaged by handicapped children in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", where his elaborate plan to beat the handicapped children in athletics backfires, with him placing dead last in every sport. In ""[[1%]]"", he performed so poorly on the school's gym athletics test that it brought the school's average down to the worst in the country.

Cartman is shown carrying more weapons than any other kid in South Park, although where he obtains these weapons is never properly explained. He has been shown using a dagger when trying to stop Stan and Kyle from destroying the [[Wall-Mart]], and a pair of sai (a Japanese short sword) in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"". He never actually struck anyone with these weapons, although it is pretty obvious he could have.

In the early episode ""[[Chickenlover]]"", Cartman receives a nightstick (otherwise known as a baton) due to his duty as police officer. He constantly uses it to abuse suspects and criminals, usually hitting them in the legs.

In ""[[Imaginationland]]"", Cartman is seen brandishing a Bowie knife.

In ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", he also was shown using a very potent type of mace designed for use on bears. He uses it with gusto on suspects and people evading capture, as well as on people who probably did not need it. The rest of his crew uses the same mace.

Cartman also carries around what appears to be a Glock 17 pistol that has been seen in a few episodes. He however has never fired it, and only uses it to threaten people. He used it to ""persuade"" Kyle into giving him his Jew Gold in ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]."" In ""[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"", Cartman used it to threaten the president of FOX, however he realizes soon that he forgot to load it, causing him to throw it to the ground in frustration. In ""[[The China Probrem]]"" when he and Butters stormed a Chinese restaurant, and he orders Butters to use his gun to hold the crowd and fire at any intruders (although Cartman begins to regret giving Butters the firearm, as Butters keeps accidentally shoots men in the dick). His most recent use of the weapon was in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", where he threatens [[Liane Cartman|his mother]] at gunpoint, who soon after reciprocated the action.

Despite the fact that he has many weapons at his disposal, he does not seem to be very good with them. In ""[[Wing]]"", he is seen firing an unidentified assault rifle, although he never can land precise shots with it due to the recoil making Cartman flail his arms around, although this is understandable as 9 year olds are not generally intended to use firearms. He killed two Chinese but he was not aiming at them. He also shows an inability to use his dagger when fighting Kenny over the Wall-Mart, although it is likely he either had no interest in killing Kenny (only use the dagger for threatening people), or that he was too pre-occupied with Kenny lightly slapping him to use it.

Cartman uses bladed finger gloves similar to Freddy Krueger when dressed as The Coon. Cartman beats up several people with these weapons; Mint Berry Crunch and The Mosquito at the same time, though it was a surprise attack, a little girl in an airport; several adults in an attempt to stop ""murders"" and ""rapes"", and fights off [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] and [[General Disarray]], though he is eventually beaten. This shows skill, though most were surprise.

Cartman gains the ability to fire electricity at people in ""[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut]]"" by way of a defective [[V-Chip]]. Cartman uses this ability by using words that are considered naughty. Cartman kills a black demon, and is shown beating [[Saddam Hussein]] in a fight, whereas the military could not even harm him with machine guns. Cartman also rises into the air after a chain of naughty words, including ""[[Barbra Streisand]]"". Cartmans electrokinesis is gone in the show, most likely removed as a result of [[Satan]] making everything ""go back to how it used to be"" as per Kenny's final request.

In ""[[1%]]"", Cartman successfully engineers ( Subconsciously, in a psychotic delusion. ) the ""deaths"" of all his stuffed animals. Cartman ""kills"" [[Clyde Frog]] by slicing him open in several places, and crucifying him to a tree, showing skill with a blade, and enough strength to force sewing needles into a tree; he ""kills"" Peter Panda by setting him on fire while sleepwalking; he ""kills"" [[Muscleman Marc]] by supposedly boiling him alive; he hooks a bomb collar he apparently made himself onto Wumpletumpkins, showing immense skill with traps and explosives as well as creating and inventing deadly weapons that could be used by the military; and he shoots [[Polly Prissypants]] in the head with a magnum revolver several times and using the entire load case of the gun, which was 6 shots total, showing incredible marksmanship, never missing a shot, and always hitting the head and not damaging the chair at all despite the recoil the revolver had.

Cartman, along with the ret of the town, gets addicted to guns in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", although he does not fire one.

In the episode ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", Cartman is shown to be able to cook hamburgers very well, if only achievable after putting them in his underpants.

Cartman also makes something called a ""Toaster Pastry Chocolate Mix Butter Bar"", by taking two pop tarts and sandwiching them with a stick of butter covered in chocolate milk mix in ""[[Fat Camp]]"".

[[File:N107325192636835_435.jpg|thumb|Picture From Cartman On Facebook]]
Cartman has a Facebook account as seen in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"". He ran a regular podcast named Mad Friends (parody of Mad Money). The episode is based on the ever growing [[Facebook]] craze. He tried to help Kyle delete [[Kip Drordy]] and get new friends by using Chat Roulette, but the only result he got were men masturbating and pictures of penises. In the real world, he has a Facebook account which is run by someone from [[South Park Studios]].

In the episode ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"", Cartman's backpack is shown with a tag that reads:
::E. Cartman
::21208 E. Bonaza Cir.
::South Park, CO

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he has converted to Judaism and becomes a rabbi, assuming the role as the head of Gespetzah Synagogue in Colorado Springs. He is married to [[Yentl Cartman]] and has three children: [[Menorah Cartman|Menorah]], [[Moisha Cartman|Moisha]], and [[Hackelm Cartman|Hackelm]].

In order to protect his family, Cartman decides to foil Stan and Kyle's plan in traveling back to the past and change the future, establishing a faction against time travel. Through the help of Butters, Cartman successfully takes control of the time travel machine. He instructs Clyde to travel back in time and kill Kyle, but was intervened by the older Kyle, before getting into a fight. Yentl observes that her husband has changed his behavior since returning to South Park, and advices him to ""leave it to chance,"" or he would be ""no better than Kyle"", to which Cartman agrees.

Cartman, Stan, and Kyle eventually return to the past and fix their relations, albeit having to stop Clyde from killing the younger Kyle themselves. This sets an alternate timeline where Cartman becomes a homeless person.

Cartman wears a red jacket, yellow mittens, a blue hat with a yellow puff ball on top, brown pants, black shoes, and white socks (as seen in ""[[Super Fun Time]]""). He sometimes wears a green t-shirt with a bear picture on under his jacket, a white tank top, and occasionally a dark red t-shirt. He has medium-brown hair and a double-chin. He also has triangular-shaped eyebrows, in contrast to the other main boys' rectangular ones. Even though Cartman is overweight, he always denies it (especially in the earlier seasons) by saying, ""I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned"", or some variation thereof. However, as seen in ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"" and ""[[Cartmanland]]"", his weight problem may be, in truth, be genetic and runs in the family, as seen by the fact that, with the exception of his mother an aunt, and [[Alexandra Cartman|a cousin]], his entire family is extremely overweight. But in ""[[Fat Camp]]"", when he tells his mother to talk about how he is big boned and such, she instead says, ""Those were all lies, sweetie, you're just fat."" In ""[[Tsst]]"", he is slightly thinner, although in later episodes, he was shown to have regained the lost weight. Cartman likely has blue irises, as, due to the events of ""[[The Succubus]]"", he has Kenny's eyes, which were shown with blue in ""[[Starvin' Marvin]]"". In [[Season Twenty]], he wears a t-shirt with the words ""Token's Life Matters"".

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Cartman is supposedly converted into Judaism. He wears a dark gray suit with black tie and white shirt, along with a pair of round glasses. His yarmulke resembles the blue hat with yellow puff that he wears in childhood.
[[File:EricWithoutHat.jpg|thumb|Cartman uncapped in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]""]]
Cartman is described in various terms, in short, he is an evil, vicious, angry, self-absorbed, immature, destructive, sarcastic, snooty, loud-mouthed, lazy, and insane child. He is the most foul-mouthed character in the show. He is also racist and stereotypes almost everyone he sees. The very dark, usually disturbing undertones to his personality often hint at an extreme mental imbalance. Apart from being portrayed as having a general lack of moral responsibility or social conscience, he also seems to take pleasure from others' misfortune and is generally unable to show empathy, although there have been exceptions, such as in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]."" Despite the severity of his actions, it is likely that they are a type of emotional defense mechanism against his insecurity and (potential) confused sexuality. This ""defense"", however, does not seem to be impenetrable, as evidenced by ""[[1%]]"". This has been parodied as well, in the cliché of a typical villain becoming benevolent. In these episodes, he usually convinces [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] that he has good intentions, such as in the ""[[Cartoon Wars Part I|Cartoon Wars]]"" two-parter, where Cartman appears to Kyle that he is concerned about people's safety at the beginning, but it is later shown to only have been doing it to get ''[[Family Guy]]'' off the air. In the ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"" and ""[[Probably]]"" two-parter, Kyle and many others fall for Cartman's apparently ""good intentions"" for trying to prevent the children of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] from going to hell. However, it is revealed that he only did it so he could earn money. In ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", he is distraught at [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] impending death leading Kyle to console him. Later when his supposedly real motives were revealed, knowing how Cartman typically is, Kyle promptly fights him in Kenny's defense, although Cartman was genuinely distraught over Kenny's illness before and after he learns that he can benefit from it. This clearly shows that Cartman went through Congress for Kenny and reveals that he does not have a healthy way of dealing with the death of his friend.

Cartman can, on rare occasions, show compassion towards cats, as in ""[[Major Boobage]]"" in which he hides cats in his attic from the authorities. This compassion hints that he has not progressed to be a full sociopath.

In ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", Kyle sums up Cartman's character as a ""fat, racist, self-centered, intolerant, manipulative sociopath"".

[[File:SouthParkIsGay025.png|right|thumb|Cartman as a metrosexual in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]""]]
He has been shown to harass and bully people at his school, and, as a result, many people in the show despise him. Cartman, however, does not consider himself to be a bully who likes to pick on other people to pleasure himself; in fact, he seems to disregard good or bad altogether (or perhaps simply does not have a concept of it) and does whatever he feels necessary for him to get ahead. Cartman seems to be motivated not so much by personal gain as by asserting superiority over others. In ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"", he won $20 in a bet with Kyle, but, instead of using the money, he simply kept flaunting it in front of Kyle until Kyle conceded that Cartman was right, ruining his sense of victory and causing him to throw a tantrum (and apparently even abandon the money and having it given back to Kyle). The same thing happens in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"": Kyle makes a $10 bet that he can get a platinum album before Cartman, Cartman makes a successful album and makes millions of dollars and earning the album. But, when Cartman wins a myrrh album and discovers that the Christian companies do not give out platinum albums ([[Jesus Christ|Christ]] did not believe in such things, the albums stem from the gifts of the three wise men; they give out gold, frankincense, and myrrh albums), thus meaning he cannot win the bet, he angrily destroys the myrrh album, showing that he did not care how he just made millions of dollars, he just wanted to beat Kyle in a bet.

Cartman's much quoted line, ""Respect my authority"" (or as Cartman pronounces it, ""respect mah authori-tah"") highlights his power hungry and dictatorial characteristics. Despite these traits, Cartman rarely commands respect from his peers. Cartman's friendships with the other kids are clearly existent, but just not shown as much because of his personality.

Ironically, despite (or perhaps because of) these qualities, Cartman also seems to be a natural leader, able to utilize overwhelming charisma and rhetoric to gain the obedience of large groups on a moment's notice (as in ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]""), appearing to be innately aware of how to take advantage of ""mob mentality"" and direct it toward accomplishing his personal goals, as has been evidenced in countless episodes throughout the series' history. In situations where the other boys share his goals, Cartman is often the ''de facto'' leader (e.g. ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", ""[[The List]]"", and ""[[Marjorine]]""). Indeed, the others consistently show a willingness to follow him and trust in his leadership when he is using his abilities for ""good.""

Cartman also seems to share many of the shows creators' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) more controversial opinions, despite both of them modeling Stan and Kyle after themselves. Examples of this include an extremely strong dislike for ''[[Family Guy]]'' for its lack of character development, plot, or smart humor. Other examples include Cartman's strong distaste of hippies, to the point that he has personally kept them out of South Park since he was 4 years old, and his belittlement of the Catholic Church as extremist, homophobic, and a supporter of pedophiles (in ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]""). He also considers John Lennon to be the ""king of hippies"".

Even though Cartman is a child, he discriminates against a lot of people. In fact, he is a racist, sexist, and specialist. He hates African Americans, Mexicans, Native Americans, Aborigines, and Asians. He is a racist because he thinks that ""minorities"" would take over the world someday as revealed in ""[[The China Probrem]]"" and in ""[[Pee]]"". In first three seasons, Cartman did not show any racism but it soon developed after the events of ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"". His discrimination lead to him becoming a bully on Tolkien Black as he was African American. His sexism is also seen in the series as he hates girls too but that is because he is sexually confused. He actually believes that girls and women are weaker than men and stupider too. However he was proven wrong about that after he got beat up by [[Wendy Testaburger]] in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"". His sexism also made him turn his own mom into a personal slave who spoils Eric with anything he wanted, however, she started to resist him in ""[[Tsst]]"". Cartman's speciesism is also seen in the show and started to show it against his cat, Mr. Kitty. Cartman also has bigotry towards extraterrestrials and is extremely xenophobic but that is simply because some visitors placed an anal probe into him twice, thus starting his speciesism. However this kind of speciesism against alien races is very rarely seen in the show.

[[File:Pinkeye014.png|right|thumb|Cartman as Adolf Hitler]]
""''If you had a chance to go back in time right now and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it? I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him, because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?''"" - Cartman in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]""

Cartman is extremely anti-Semitic, and a great many of his bigoted actions are directed towards all Jews and especially toward his Jewish friend [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], whom he openly hates and considers sub-human because of his faith. In the episode .""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"", after seeing The Passion of the Christ, he believes the film was [[Mel Gibson]]'s way of rallying people against the Jews, and idolizes him for it. He then dresses up as Hitler and manipulates a group of people, who think that they are simply raising awareness for the movie and Christianity, to join him in an anti-Jew march while chanting in mispronounced [[Germany|German]]: ""''Es ist Zeit für Rache''"" (It is time for revenge'') and ""''Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten''"" (''We must exterminate the Jews'').''

When he tried to win the Special Olympics by feigning a disability in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"" , Kyle attempts to talk him out of it by telling him, regardless of their differences, that Cartman will surely go to [[Hell]] for such an act; Cartman replies that Kyle does not understand that Hell is reserved for the Jews, indicating once again his self-righteousness. He also has been shown to consider Judaism to be a disability and the title ""Jew"" to be an insult. He also believes Jews to be incapable of many professions, such as [[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina|basketball player]], [[Rainforest Shmainforest|singing/rhythm]], [[Pre-School|fireman]], [[Fatbeard|pirate]] or even so much as [[Something You Can Do with Your Finger|someone tough]], however on some occasions his accusations have been proven true (particularly rhythm).

In the episode ""[[Pinkeye]]"", Cartman dresses up as Hitler for Halloween (A costume made by his mother even though Cartman himself did not know who Hitler was, showing that his antisemitism may come from his mother in some part). When shown a documentary to demonstrate why dressing like him is not cool, Cartman is enthralled and imagines himself being the one commanding the Nazi troops in the video. Cartman's admiration for Hitler is further emphasized in ""[[The Entity]]"", after being offered $40 by Kyle not to tease Kyle's cousin, [[Kyle Schwartz]]. Since Cartman has trouble restraining himself from teasing Kyle Schwartz about his Jewish heritage (since he is the stereotypical Jew that Kyle Broflovski had been trying to avoid being for five years), when [[Ms. Choksondik]] later tells Kyle Schwartz to concentrate, Cartman impulsively blurts out: ""''Maybe we should send him to concentration camp!''""

A contradiction of his idolization of Adolf Hitler is seen in ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"" where in this episode Cartman is incapable of pronouncing ""Nazi"" correctly (pronouncing it ""Nay-zee"") upon seeing it written, as though he had never come upon the word before. Another contradiction occurs in ""[[Tsst]]"", when Cartman compares his mother who had been instructed how to treat her rampantly egocentric son by the Dog Whisperer, with Hitler, as a reason why she should be killed (although this is probably because Cartman is not being allowed to indulge in his personal desires).

In addition to taking regular jabs at racial, ethnic and religious minorities, as well as people of lower income like [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], Cartman is also prejudicial against red-haired, light skinned and freckled people, which means that he is anti ginger. This particular prejudice most probably originated from the notorious incident with [[Scott Tenorman]], who had red hair and freckles, although it may also be partially due to the fact that Kyle has red hair and Liane Cartman's presumed prejudice against red haired people. He believes that ginger kids are the most evil people in the world and that they have no souls, which is clearly false. During the episode ""[[Ginger Kids]]"", when the other three boys lead him to believe he has become a Ginger himself in order to teach him a lesson, he is horrified. Later, he organizes a cult of homicidal Ginger children bent on world conquest known as the ""[[Ginger Separatist Movement]]"", remarking: ""''I'm not going to live my life as a Goddamn minority!''"" Ironically, Cartman has an aunt who is red-haired. An even bigger irony however, would be when he later discover that he was indeed half-Ginger, as his biological father, [[Jack Tenorman]] (who was also father of Scott Tenorman) was a Ginger football player for the [[Denver Broncos]]. This would technically make him a ""Daywalker""; he does have the Ginger gene. Cartman hates ginger kids a lot because he thinks that they would take over the world someday and are soulless. Cartman seems to ignore his half ginger heritage in later episodes simply because he is ashamed of it.

Cartman also may harbor some bigotry towards African-Americans. He is never shown out right hating black people (although he does believe in several stereotypes), and is shown several times playing with [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] and seeking advice from [[Chef]] (one of the few characters on the show Cartman generally respected). Although Cartman was in jail for his ""hate crime"" on Tolkien, even though it is quite obvious he did not bash Tolkien's head with a rock because he is black, but because he thought Tolkien had insulted him (it was in fact Kyle who did this). Even though he usually rips on Tolkien for being black, and he said he is gonna kill Tolkien someday - (""[[Christian Rock Hard]]""), he does not seem to harbor negative feelings for black people, and Cartman always says he is going to kill people, so saying he was going to kill Tolkien might not be personal. In ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", when Butters asks him what if he is not supposed to go to Heaven, but to ""heck"", Cartman responds ""''I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!''"". This is strange because in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"" when Kyle informs that Cartman is going to cheat, Cartman responds to this by saying that hell is only reserved for Jews, but he did not include African Americans into the mix.

[[File:Pinkeye079.png|thumb|Cartman as a ""Ghost"".]]
Cartman's most passionate abhorrence is aimed at hippies, though he seems to use this term for liberals in general. In ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"", he believes that hippies will destroy the town, and while the rest of the townspeople are initially skeptical, his fears are eventually borne out. When too close to liberals, he suffers what could be called an allergic reaction. He also wore a bio-suit upon entering [[San Francisco]] in ""[[Smug Alert!]]"". His primary goal of that was because he needed someone to pick on (he had started to pick on Butters, but Butters just was not feeling it.). Cartman's hatred of hippies and allergic reaction to liberals could mean that Cartman is a conservative. This means that Cartman does support the republican party but he did not tantrum over any losses in presidential elections, unlike [[Ike Broflovski]]. Instead of throwing tantrums, Cartman burglarizes houses and steals property from liberals and conservatives as revealed in ""[[About Last Night...]]"" when he broke into peoples houses and stole their T.V.'s in order to make some cash while they were out getting drunk on the streets or had killed themselves. He seems to have some liberal beliefs, he never openly states that he is a Republican but does say that Democrats piss him off, although he does not need to have any objection to them protesting in ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"".

Cartman's bigotry and antisemitism seem to come in second next to his personal needs, however; despite his hate for the Jews, Cartman saves Kyle in the episode ""[[Smug Alert!]]"" because he can find no one else to pick on. In ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"", he is not above thanking Kyle for stopping him from humiliating himself on national television. Also, he saved the life of Kyle, (who had been killed by [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]]) in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]""; while this was seemingly because Kyle would not be able to suck his balls if he died, he was shown to cry, and showed concern even before the military leader reminded him that ""at least now he does not have to suck anyone's balls."" Enraged, Cartman yells in despair, ""''No, he has a strong heart, he wants to live!!!''"" and began performing CPR on his dying ""friend"".

Cartman is usually an orderly individual, while his goals are chaotic in nature, he obeys rules when they suit him, even using order to manipulate other people. He often idolizes people whom he feels share his various bigotries and aims. By this reasoning, he falls under ""Neutral Evil"", with no particular preference towards law or chaos, as either one can be used to his advantage. Cartman is usually cold-hearted and selfish, but can be warm-hearted and caring on a whim. This sensitive and selfless side of Cartman is often a superficial cover up for a selfish scheme he has in mind.

It has been repeatedly shown that Cartman has serious behavioral and emotional problems. He has extremely exaggerated anger issues and violent tendencies when upset. Perhaps the best example of this is seen in ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", when he had two people shot, ground into chili and then fed to their distraught son, causing a horrified Kyle to say that he and Stan should never piss off Cartman again. This has since been regarded as Cartman's defining moment and has been brought up again countless times during the series.

[[File:FreakStrike14.jpg|thumb|""''Whateva, I'll do what I want!''"" - Cartman posing as a teenage prostitute]]
He also has displayed traits of gender confusion; he occasionally has tea parties with stuffed dolls (pretending they are talking about how cool he is), owns a (supposed) female cat named ""[[Mr. Kitty]]"", and in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", he was seen re-enacting a scene from ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as Buffalo Bill with a rag doll he named Polly Prissy-Pants trapped down a well. In ""[[Freak Strike]]"", Cartman goes on the Maury Povich Show to be a panelist during a discussion on out-of-control kids. In an attempt to win the assumed prize, he dresses up as a promiscuous teenage girl. In the episode ""[[AWESOM-O]]"", Butters reveals to the residents of South Park a video of Cartman dressed as [[Britney Spears]], while dancing around a cardboard cut-out of Justin Timberlake, which he apparently later made out with.

Cartman's confused sexuality is most apparent in the episode ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", in which Cartman takes pictures of himself with Butters' penis in his mouth to make Butters look gay. However, Kyle, Stan and Kenny explain that such actions actually make Cartman look gay, which results in Cartman trying to get a picture taken of his own penis in Butters' mouth. Another moment of this apparent confusion can be seen during the events of the ""[[Imaginationland]]"" trilogy, where he bet Kyle that leprechauns were real, and if he won, Kyle would have to suck his balls. Although Cartman was proven to be right, Kyle refused, causing Cartman to become obsessed, and began going to extreme lengths to force Kyle to suck on his balls. When [[Jimmy]] later questions his motive behind pursuing Kyle to get him to suck his balls as being ""a little faggy"", he explains that it was all to humiliate Kyle. In [[Le Petit Tourette]] he unconsciously blurts out that he touched penises with his [[Elvin Cartman|cousin]].

Ever since Cartman's voice has changed, he has a peculiar, geographically indeterminable accent, or possibly speech impediment, with odd pronunciations of certain words and names which has shown to be a dominant trait in the extended Cartman family. Aside from the sheer volume of expletives in his dialog, he also uses words in different (and often grammatically incorrect) context. Some examples of this are: instead of saying 'I'm serious"" he will say ""I'm seriously"", instead of saying ""here"" he will say ""heahre"" (sometimes in the earlier episodes, he would even pronounce ""here"" as ""myah""), apologized to Wendy by saying he was very ""remoursefulness"" for his actions (""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]""), and instead of saying ''""respect my authority""'', he would say ''""respect mah authoritah.""'' This became a well-known catchphrase of the show.

A defining arc during the show's [[Season Four|fourth season]] was Cartman's single-minded quest to make 10 million dollars. The schemes he has tried include; [[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000|becoming a part of the Denver ""tooth racket""; and stealing Tooth Fairy money from kids]], [[Something You Can Do with Your Finger|starting a boy band called Fingerbang]], and [[Probably|forming his own church and embezzling its collection money]] These all failed miserably for several reasons. He also tried at it in the episode ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"" when Kyle's kidneys were failing and Cartman, being the only one with Kyle's blood type, demanded a payment of 10 million dollars when Stan begged him to let Kyle have his kidney. He has also tried to [[Kenny Dies|sell a crashed truck-load of aborted fetuses]] to the highest-bidding stem cell research center, and even to [[Shakey's Pizza|a restaurant]] as food. In ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", Cartman had also pretended he was retarded to compete in the Special Olympics and win $1000. The reasons for this are never fully explained, although in one episode ""[[Cartmanland]]"", after inheriting a million dollars from his grandmother, he reveals that he wishes to buy his own amusement park so he would not have to wait in lines for the rides. He also stated that it has been his dream to own a million dollars since he was two years old. In ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"", he threatens Kyle with a gun for his ""[[Jew Gold]]"". In ""[[ManBearPig]]"" Cartman stumbles upon a pile of treasure while the boys are trapped in a system of caves. Afraid that the others might find the treasure and demand a share, Cartman decides to swallow as many of the coins and jewels as he can, causing him to become extremely bloated and unable to walk or swim on his own. Later in the episode it is revealed, during the process of painfully crapping it out, that the treasure is fake and used for photographs for tourists at the caves. He is miserably and completely scrooged, determined not to give up the slightest amount of money, such as refusing to give a dollar to Afghan children in ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"", ""I'm not giving a ''dollar'' to those towel-heads!"" [[Craig Tucker]] observed in ""[[Fishsticks]]"" that [[Jimmy]] was lucky Cartman was only asking for half the money that would be made from patenting a joke that Jimmy had come up with, and Cartman was intent on taking credit for (he had actually lied on the couch eating chips, offering no input).

Although Cartman can at times be worldly, he is often wildly misinformed; he once believed that dolphins lived in igloos and mistook a canned food drive for 'when you cut open a chick's stomach and pull out the baby from inside,' and mistakes sexual harassment when 'you're having intercourse with a lady friend and someone tickles your balls from behind.'

Cartman appears to know very little about the female anatomy. In ""[[The Return of Chef]]"" he threatened a woman with, ""''Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off''"". Also, in the episode ""[[Chickenpox]]"", when he was told that his [[Liane Cartman|mom]] sent him to [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s house so he would catch chickenpox, he claimed that he would ""kick her square in the nuts"". In ""[[Raisins]]"", he agreed with Butters when he said to Bebe ""''Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes.''""

In ""[[The List]]"", he made a plan to steal a list the girls made of who the cutest boys in the class were. The plan involved Butters kicking one of the girls in the balls, which failed of course, forcing Cartman and the rest of the boys to conclude that ""Our mission failed, but we've learned a lot; primarily that girls do not have balls"". Despite this, in ""[[Member Berries]]"" he was shown to still not have learned this. In ""[[Fort Collins]]"", having seen [[Heidi Turner]]'s vagina, it is implied he still does not realize women do not have balls.

In ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"", Cartman claimed he had hit puberty because he had his period, when really he had an infection that made him bleed out his butt (he did not realize that only girls got periods until [[God]] told him at the end of the episode.)

In ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", it is shown that Cartman's idea of sexual intercourse is to ""''Stick it inside her and pee. If you don't want to get her pregnant you pull it out and pee on her leg.''"" In the [[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe|first episode]]. Cartman complains ""Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!"" showing ignorance of the context in which ""dildo"" is used and, possibly, what a dildo is. However, it is possible he is using it as a generic insult, such as calling someone a ""dick"".

Also in [[Pee]], his ignorance is again displayed when he thinks all the minorities in ""his"" water park are what the Mayans predicted and by 2012, the apocalypse will be when the whole world is minorities.

Cartman also confuses English people with French people. In the early seasons, he often teased Pip and called him a ""''French piece of crap''"". On the other extreme, in the movie, he called [[The Mole]] a ""'British piece of' shit"", despite The Mole being supposedly French. Additionally, in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", he alludes to despising Austrians, apparently failing to note the irony of the fact that he admires Hitler, who was Austrian.

It is also worth noting that Cartman is completely oblivious to the fact the other kids hate him, and often assumes they are joking when they imply or even openly declare it.

In the episode ""[[201]]"" Cartman completely ignores the fact that he got his own father killed and fed to his half-brother and is more concerned about being half-ginger.

In ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", Cartman is oblivious to the fact that his making another student crap herself is useless when trying to prevent the suicide of another student.

[[File:ImALittleBitCountry061.png|right|thumb|Cartman in the 1700s.]]
Cartman shows a pathological degree of impatience when forced to do something he does not want to do or when he has to wait for something he wants. An example of the former is seen in ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"", in which Cartman electrocutes himself in an attempt to create a flashback and avoid studying. In the episode ""[[Go God Go]]"", where Cartman freezes himself so that he would not have to wait three weeks for the [[List of Video Game References#Nintendo Wii|Nintendo Wii]] console to be released, which shows irony in the end; Butters cannot find where Cartman was frozen due to an avalanche, and Eric is thawed out almost 500 years in the future, the people there zap him back to his own time where it turns out that he got sent back three ''months'' before the Wii's release. In [[Medicinal Fried Chicken]], Cartman is shown to be extremely agitated when he has waited to have [[KFC]] for too long and blurts out obscenities and shouting horrible things to his friends and to his mom Liane Cartman and when the KFCs get replaced with medicinal marijuana stores, he goes to an addiction clinic to be prescribed with KFC gravy.
Although Cartman frequently insults and taunts his friends, he sometimes appears to be more cowardly than they are when it comes to physical confrontation. In ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", after Cartman repeatedly threatens to beat Kyle up if they do not get home in time for Christmas, Kyle punches Cartman and he immediately bursts into tears. A similar instance can be seen during ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", although Kyle only punches Cartman in the arm. Cartman may react like this to gain sympathy from other boys so he may turn the other boys against Kyle (showcased in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", where he turned Butters and a few other boys against Kyle by exaggerating how Kyle pushed him against a tree) or he could just be cowardly, it is unknown which (It is likely the latter).

At the end of ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", after Cartman revealed his true motives for fighting to lift the ban on stem cell research, to replicate a ""[[Shakey's Pizza]]"" and not to save Kenny's life, Kyle, enraged about this, brutally begins to beat up Cartman, delivering several blows to his chest and a good roundhouse right. The beating continued on until the end of the episode and has not been mentioned at all since, although it shows Kyle was able to beat Cartman easily when angry.

[[File:WithApologiesToJesseJackson082.png|thumb|Cartman and [[Dr. David Nelson|Dr. Nelson]], engaged in a fight in ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"".]]
In ""[[Goobacks]]"", Cartman threatens Kyle and it leads to Kyle giving Cartman a bloody nose. In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", Cartman is beaten up by [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] after provoking him with racial jibes. In several episodes, he is seen able to overpower Kenny, but in some episodes he is not capable of doing so. However, in earlier episodes like ""[[Damien]]"" he is able to beat up Kyle. Despite this, Kyle beat up Cartman in the more recent ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"" without hesitation.

In ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", Cartman has no problem with fighting the other boys back physically (and it is revealed that Sumo is his martial art of choice). In ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"" he smiles and sings the Dawson's Creek theme while he kills the Official Messenger Boy with a piece of wood then drags the body off-screen, although this happens in what was essentially a fantasy of Cartman's and may, therefore, due to Cartman's inflated ego, not be representative of his actual abilities. Also in the episode ""[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"", he and Kyle have a slap fight, which he won (though this was more through deceit than skill), and in the episode ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", he was dominant in a physical fight against a midget (who supposedly had a black belt in karate). Also in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"" he threw a rock at Tolkien, giving him a black eye.

In ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", Cartman is shown being physically abusive to innocent kids in the hallways. He once pushes an unnamed kid up against a wall, until the kid showed him his hall pass, after which Cartman acts as if nothing happened. The kid questions Cartman about his abuse of power, and Cartman promptly kicks him across the room in a somewhat cartoonish way, although he is never shown pulling off a feat like that again.

In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", Cartman is shown to be quite nervous over fighting [[Wendy]] and is shown going to great lengths to avoid the confrontation. However, when Wendy decides to fight him regardless, he is quite spectacularly defeated.Cartman has a disturbing habit of appearing in other people's homes in the middle of the night. He has a preoccupation with becoming mature, or at least more so than his friends, which frequently ends in him doing something that is anything but mature. Cartman also appears to be driven by a desire to surpass Kyle (especially), Stan, and Kenny. Knowing that his satisfaction chiefly comes with seeing other people unhappy, Kyle once deliberately congratulated Cartman on winning a bet. This, of course, ruined Cartman's egotistical satisfaction at having humiliated him.

Cartman also carries around what appears to be a Glock 17 pistol that has been seen in several episodes. He has actually never fired it, and only uses it to threaten people. He used it to ""persuade"" Kyle into giving him his Jew Gold in ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]."" In ""[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"", Cartman used it to threaten the president of FOX, however he realizes soon that he forgot to load it, causing him to throw it to the ground in frustration. His most recent use of it was when he and Butters stormed a Chinese restaurant, and he orders Butters to use his gun to hold the crowd and fire at any intruders (although Cartman begins to regret giving Butters the firearm because he keeps accidentally shooting men in the genitals).

Cartman apparently sees scenes of sickening and/or disturbing imagery every time he closes his eyes, but thinks nothing of it. He also occasionally has milk come out of his nose when he laughs, even when he was not drinking any. This milk-sneezing problem is due to a malfunctioning kidney, which Cartman is tricked into donating for transplant, benefiting his friend Kyle, who receives the malfunctioning organ as seen in the episode ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"". Many of Cartman's mannerisms were revealed to be inherited in ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"", in which most of the Cartman family were depicted in a similar manner.

Eric is quite possibly morbidly obese. In ""[[1%]]"", it is revealed that he is so unhealthy that he single-handedly made the school's average on the Presidential Fitness Test the lowest in the entire country, despite the fact that all of the other students scored average on the test.
In the first episode of the twelfth season, ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"", it is revealed that Cartman has in the past needed a routine tonsil checkup. In this episode, however, he was diagnosed with tonsillitis and his tonsils had to be removed. In doing so, they accidentally gave him HIV, the virus that causes [[AIDS]]. He was angered by this and his anger worsened when Kyle laughed - out of irony, disbelief and thrill that something so horrible has happened to his worst enemy. Cartman, with the help of Butters, then snuck into Kyle's room and intentionally gave Kyle AIDS. Kyle figured it out and hunted Cartman down and beat him up in the schoolyard and broke many of his toys (including [[Clyde Frog]]). Cartman, in the meantime, researched the virus and found out that [[Magic Johnson]] had AIDS for decades and is still alive. Cartman and Kyle then found out, along with Mr. Johnson, that the actual cure for AIDS was heavy doses of cash, the point being the solution to any problem is to throw lots and lots of cold-hard cash at it. Cartman and Kyle have both since recovered from the disease. Kyle still made it a point to break his Xbox after they come back from New York and LA curing AIDS.

In the episode ""[[The Succubus]]"" it is revealed that Cartman's eyesight is very bad. After several unsuccessful attempts by the optician to cure them, including a pupil dilation that resulted in him walking into several walls and a botched laser eye surgery that ended up with Cartman having to wear bandages over his eyes for three days, he managed to get a transplant from a ""donor"" who's head he had preserved in ice - the donor being [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], who Cartman says had perfect sight.
[[File:Cartman berrinche.png|right|thumb|Cartman having a tantrum]]
However, obesity, HIV, poor eyesight, and bad tonsils may be the least of Cartman's health concerns; Cartman seems to have a very poor mental health. He shows signs of not only anti-social behavior, but also sadism, identity issues, sexual confusion, psychosis, psychopathic nature, and narcissism. He apparently dreams of humiliating, beating, emotionally destroying or even killing Kyle. For example, in ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", Cartman dreams of taunting Kyle (""I told ya so!"") so much that the latter starts crying. In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", he seems to hope to kill Kyle without any reason. However, it was not until the [[Season Five]] episode ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"" incident that we see how deep his insanity goes, when he creates a highly elaborate and sociopathy scheme, resulting in murder and cannibalism. In ""[[Tsst]]"", he beats up a kid, handcuffs him to the flagpole, gives him a hacksaw, poisons him, and tells him the only way to get to the antidote was to saw off his leg. This is similar to the ''Saw'' movies.

Cartman also seems incapable to admit his own errors and history, and instead alters past events in his own mind to show himself in a better light, as seen in ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"" (though so did everyone else) and ""[[Fishsticks]]"". Cartman's mind even once backfired against him during ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"", during which he made everyone believe he was suffering from [[Tourette's Syndrome]], so as to be able to go around saying whatever horrible hateful thing he wanted without consequences. Unfortunate, this resulted in him being completely unable to control what he said, and began revealing assorted secrets such as him and his cousin touching penises. Cartman's sanity is called in to question with the existence of [[Mitch Conner|Mitch Conner/Jennifer Lopez]], who is Cartman's hand given a personality/backstory. In [[Fat Butt and Pancake Head|""Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"" Cartman did ventriloquism with his hand, claiming it thought itself to be a real person, named Mitch Conner, who was a con-man posing as Jennifer Lopez. Cartman would often argue with the hand at length, and the hand would apparently work independently of Cartman, such as masturbating [[Ben Affleck]]. Cartman would later claim it was just a prank on Kyle and the others. However, in ""[[200]]"", Cartman brings back Mitch Conner to swindle a group of celebrities, and again proceeds to argue with his hand and disagreeing with it, despite the fact there is no one around him to trick, leading one to believe that Cartman really believes the hand is a person. The hand also claims to have knowledge that Cartman does not, such as who Cartman's father really is. In ""[[201]]"" it is revealed that Cartman is [[Scott Tenorman]]'s half-brother, meaning that he killed his own father; [[Jack Tenorman]] and fed it to Scott Tenorman in a bowl of chili. However, he was more concerned about being half-ginger than the fact that he murdered his own father.

In ""[[T.M.I.]]"", it is revealed that Cartman has an exceptionally tiny penis (even for a boy of 9 years old), and the insecurity of that seems to a leading or at least additional factor driving Cartman's psychotic rages. When the schools posts height measurements in the hallway for the boys, Cartman assumes it to be penis sizes and demands all the boys measure their sizes to disprove the original measurements. His rage in this particularly incident leads him to getting Anger Management, during which his doctor attempts to insult him to produce an angry reaction. Cartman oddly enough does not demonstrate his rage vocally, in a coldly sadistic manner by manipulating the doctor's wife into killing herself through a simple set of text messages. Cartman is then put in a group anger management session, during which he several like-minded individuals with small penises go on a rage driven rampage.

In ""[[1%]]"", it appears that Cartman has multiple identity disorder, as he appears to have ""murdered"" his stuffed animals while having no memory of destroying them. However, it is implied that ventriloquism is used only when the toys speak, and that they do indeed have a mind of their own. For example, Cartman could not possibly have killed his stuffed animals while heading downstairs with Tolkien. Cartman could be best described as having sadistic personality disorder with passive-aggressive traits, also known as a ""Tyrannical Sadist"".

Cartman often shows less interest in sexuality than the other boys. This seems intentional on the writer's parts, and fits with his self-absorption, immaturity, and gender confusion. An example for this would be seen in the episode ""[[Raisins]]"", where the boys end up in an [[Raisins (Location)|eponymous Hooters-like restaurant]], and Cartman only shows interest in the food, rather than all the skimpily-dressed waitresses. The other boys, however, do show interest in them, except Stan, who was too depressed at the time because [[Wendy Testaburger]] broke up with him.

In ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", [[Wendy]] kisses Cartman on the lips at the flag debate, due to the fact she had a weird dream about him and started feeling attracted to him in the middle of the episode. However, as soon as she was done kisses him, she had no more feelings for him. Although at the end Cartman walked away sad, when she said they were friends again.

Cartman also displays a lack of knowledge about sex, despite the fact that his mom is frequently having sexual relations with other people in South Park; when [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] says that Ike is too young to understand sex in the episode ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", Cartman replies, ""What's there to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some, then stick it inside her and pee"". Cartman's lack of knowledge is also displayed in the episode ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"", when he tells [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] that sexual harassment is ""trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind."" However, the other children, except for Kenny, Butters (who explains sex in great depth to Jimmy ""[[Erection Day]]"" but in a childlike sort of way) and possibly Clyde, do not seem to have more knowledge of sex than Cartman, which is probably because they are only 9 years old.

In ""[[Imaginationland]]"", Cartman makes a bet with [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], stating that if he can prove that leprechauns are real, then Kyle will suck his balls. Cartman wins the bet, and his single-minded quest to force Kyle to suck his balls subsequently becomes a significant subplot of the trilogy. Although he does not get Kyle to suck his balls in reality, he ''does'' imagine Kyle sucking the balls of an imaginary Cartman with much enthusiasm at the end of ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"". It is quite plausible, however, to assume that Cartman's obsession with his quest stems significantly from his desire to humiliate Kyle, rather than from any homosexual attraction to him.

In ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", after listening to Butters get beaten by his parents, as Cartman was responsible for it by pretending to be Butters on the phone and insulting them, Cartman says, ""If I were older I would totally start jacking off right now"", hinting at sexual sadism.

In '[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", when [[Clyde Donovan]] tells Cartman he is going to stop playing ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', Cartman says that the French also stopped playing when Hitler rose to power. He then taunts [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] by asking him if he is French, and then says, ""''Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?''"", meaning ""Do you want to sleep with me, Clyde?"" in French, although he could just be quoting the French lyric from the song ""Lady Marmalade"" without understanding the meaning, but he could have been taunting him by saying he is French and using the French stereotype as a way to taunt him.

In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", Cartman seeks to humiliate and degrade Butters by taking a picture of himself with Butters' penis in his mouth. After being told by Kyle and Stan that being photographed that way is humiliating him rather than Butters (in other words, being photographed in such a way makes him gay), Cartman then seeks out Butters to make him put his penis in Butters' mouth, but this fails, as the both of them are caught by [[Stephen Stotch|Butters' father]].

In ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", Butters is putting on a condom, when Cartman is caught by Kyle looking at Butters' penis; Cartman dismissively claims he was trying to see how to put on a condom, which Kyle does not believe.

In ""[[Cancelled]]"", Cartman once again finds himself the victim of getting an anal probe from aliens. When Chef and the boys take him to see a proctologist, the doctor sticks his finger and his entire hand in Cartman's rectum. Although initially surprised, Cartman lets out moans of pleasure, just before a fifty-foot satellite dish shoots out of his rectum. Although when the satellite retreats back into his rectum, he experiences severe pain.

However, during the events of ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", Cartman briefly became an object of affection for Stan's girlfriend [[Wendy Testaburger]]. After being passionately kissed by Wendy at the end of the episode, he is disappointed at the end when she says that she no longer has any feelings for him. In ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", Cartman, along with Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and the entire third grade class, were all attracted to the substitute teacher, [[Ms. Ellen]]. Although she was a lesbian, and the boys did not understand what it meant, they tried to become lesbians in order to try to win her. Additionally in ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"" he accidentally admitted to having a crush on a girl named [[Patty Nelson]] and also said that he and his cousin ""touched wieners"".

In ""[[W.T.F.]]"", he cross dresses as ""Bad Irene"", a woman who is addicted to abortions.

In ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"" Cartman's uses his hand as a ventriloquist dummy, who claims his hand is a con-artist named [[Mitch Conner]], who is claiming to be [[Jennifer Lopez]]. In order to try and trick the other boys into thinking that his hand might be truly sentient, Mitch/Jennifer (and thus Cartman) pursues a relationship with [[Ben Affleck]] during which Cartman proceeds to give Ben multiple hand jobs, one time even waking up in bed with a naked Affleck, his hand covered in ""Affleck splooge"". While Cartman claims this to be an act in the end, these sexual actions seems to be unconsciously executed, due to the fact that during or after, Cartman is both shocked and disgusted. The fact Cartman does this could indicate an unconscious sexual desire towards men (Ben Affleck in-particular in this case), Cartman's extreme lengths to trick his friend (despite them not being present to witness the hand jobs, making the actions pointless in the grand scheme of things), or that Cartman's Mitch Conner is part of a psychological break resulting in a multiple personality.

In ""[[T.M.I.]]"" when the schools posts a list indicating the amount of height that the male students have grown over the past year, Cartman mistakenly assumes it to mean penis size, and goes on a rampage decreeing the ""results"" to be incorrect due to the tiny size of his own. He then proceeds to demand all the boys submit to new penis measurements, which he personally administers with the exception of his own (due to the fact he falsely claimed to have 13 inch penis). During the process he compliments Butters on his size.

In ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"", Cartman's imaginary friend, [[Cupid Me]], debuts. He can only be seen by Cartman himself, which makes the other boys get confused. In ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"", he reappears and attempts to flirt with Cartman, but Cartman denies he is gay. Cartman ends up on a date with him, ending in anal sex, which is mistaken by Liane for masturbating.

The episode ""[[The Damned]]"" ends with Cartman asking [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]] what was at the bottom of a vagina, and she responds by saying ""want me to show you?"", to which he responds ""holy shit"", as the end credits begin.

Cartman has also had encounters with sexual abuse. In ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", Cartman mentions that his mom subjected him to humiliation in a sexual way. He goes on about what he would do if a girl ever threatened to fight him, but instead recounts one such incident.

In ""[[Fun with Veal]]"", Cartman is awoken by Kyle, Stan and Butters to help save some baby cows from slaughter. As the other boy's knock on his window Cartman gives a scream of ""NO UNCLE JESSE, NO!"" implying that one of his relatives may have abused him. It could also mean he has a sexual fear of Uncle Jesse from the TV show Full House.

In ""[[Cow Days]]"", he receives a concussion that makes him think he is a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li, who frequently says ""fucky sucky, five dolla"" (a reference to Stanley Kubrick's ''Full Metal Jacket''), to passing male carnival goers. He then ""services"" Leonardo DiCaprio, much to his disgust after he reverts to his normal self.

In ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", his attempt to find older friends winds up with him almost being molested by members of the [[NAMBLA]].

In ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", after discovering that semen will fertilize his sea-people, he goes to a sperm bank to collect ""sea-men"". At the sperm bank, he pretends to test a semen sample by smearing it on his fingers. When Cartman later empties a bowl of semen into the tank. He then tells Stan and Kyle that he got some of it from a man named Ralph in an alley, who told him to ""close his eyes and suck it out of a hose"".

In ""[[AWESOM-O]]"", a movie producer asks Cartman, who is disguised as a robot, if he is a pleasure model. Cartman does not understand him until he takes his pants off, at which point, he runs out yelling in monotone fashion ""Lame!"" Also, in the episode ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", Cartman convinces Ben Affleck, among others, that his left hand is an actual woman named Jennifer Lopez; Affleck later has a sexual encounter with ""Miss Lopez"", leaving Cartman's hand covered with his semen.

In ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", Cartman was one of the various victims of [[Snooki]], others being [[DogPoo Petuski]] and [[Stephen Stotch]]. Ironically, after having attacked [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] throughout most of the episode due to his being conceived in New Jersey (as well as being ginger and Jewish), Kyle is the one who saves Cartman from this encounter.

In ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", Cartman converted to [[Blaintology]] along with most of the residents in South Park. When it is revealed that all the Blaintologists are to commit mass suicide in Washington D.C. to further their cause, Cartman becomes overjoyed, even turning on Kyle who did not agree in such an act.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he has converted to Judaism and becomes a rabbi, and has a Jewish wife with three children, all of which was met with skeptism from Kyle.

The most active family member in Cartman's life is his mother, [[Liane Cartman]]. A recurring joke throughout the series is that, despite his mother's sweetness and wholesome demeanor, she is in fact a promiscuous, oversexed, crack-smoking, scheiße-porn queen, prostitute, and nymphomaniac. Many of these aspects of Liane's personal life are a constant source of annoyance for Cartman, whose friends often mock him over, and which he attempts to fruitlessly deny. An example being when Stan and Kyle continuously stated she was on the cover of ""Crack-Whore"" magazine in ""[[Pinkeye]]"". Cartman, attempted to deny this fact, until presented with the magazine itself. He then stated that she had been ""young and needed the money"", which unfortunately did not work, as Stan and Kyle pointed out that the pictures had been taken just a month ago. Liane constantly dotes over Cartman, doing almost anything he asks and at times even agreeing to his most horrible ideas and plans, such as signing him up for the Special Olympics in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]."" The fact Liane allows Cartman to bully and control her is apparently due to extreme loneliness brought up by not have a serious romantic partner and also apparently not having any close friends. She thus desires that Cartman be her 'friend', and will do anything to keep him happy. This unfortunately could explain much of his behavior. It has been implied (at least in earlier episodes) that Liane may be responsible for much of Cartman's racism, anti-semitism and homophobia, as he often was to quote disparaging things that he had supposedly heard her say. For the most part, it seemed that Cartman was perhaps lying or misquoting his mother, except for in ""[[Pinkeye]]"", in which Liane made Cartman an Adolf Hitler Halloween costume, despite Cartman not knowing who that was at the time.

For over twelve seasons since ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"", Cartman lived under the belief that his mother was a hermaphrodite and also his biological father. In ""[[200]]"" however, Cartman's hand/puppet [[Mitch Conner]] reveals that what Cartman was told was a lie and that Liane was not Cartman's father. After demanding answers out of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] and [[Mr. Hat]], it is revealed that the paternity tests were altered and one of the people in the room at the time of revelation was indeed Cartman's father. In ""[[201]]"" it is revealed that Cartman's father is actually [[Jack Tenorman]], a [[Ginger Separatist Movement|ginger]] haired member of [[File:Cartmans Dad And Sister!.jpg|thumb|Cartman's original Dad and Sister]]the [[Denver Broncos]] and father of Cartman's arch-rival [[Scott Tenorman]]. Apparently during the night of the Drunk Barn Dance, Liane proceeded to have sex with assorted men and women; however Jack was the one who impregnated her. Cartman unfortunately never got to meet his father properly, due to the fact that during his war against his half-brother Scott (in which Scott sold Eric his pubes, stating it would allow him to reach maturity), Cartman killed both Jack and his wife, ground their bodies up into ground meat, cooked it in chili and proceeded to feed it to Scott. Cartman does not regret killing his father however, instead is horrified to know that he is half-ginger and thus carries the ginger gene in his body. He was, however, happy when reminded that his father was actually a Denver Bronco.

Cartman's extended family is shown in the episode ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"", where he and the others go on a trip to Nebraska to visit them for Christmas. Most of his relatives appear to be similar in manner to him; all fat, with the same speech accent and catchphrases. The family is seen again in the episode ""[[Cartmanland]]"", at his grandmother's funeral. Where she leaves her estate (valued at $1,000,000) to Eric, citing that all the other family members would have spent it all on crack.

In the ""[[The Unaired Pilot]]"" episode, Cartman was shown to have a father and sister, but these characters were cut out in the official pilot. In ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"", he accidentally revealed that he cries at night because he does not have a real father.

He has some Dutch and Irish descent, as in ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", he mentions that his grandmother (Mabel) is Dutch-Irish.

[[File:HUMANCENTiPAD021.png|right|thumb|Cartman crying because his mother would not buy him an iPad due to expense and his misbehavior.]]
Liane dotes on her son endlessly, beyond simply spoiling him. Cartman usually gets whatever he wants simply by whining in his signature style. He also frequently insults her in her presence, which she accepts without question. Although Liane possesses a social and moral conscience, Cartman is usually able to manipulate her into doing even morally reprehensible things for him. In ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", Cartman is able to have his mother sign him up for the Special Olympics, even though Cartman was not disabled. It appears that Liane is convinced of her son's goodness and accepts any excuses or stories he makes up, no matter how improbable. The relationship between the two shows a significant change in ""[[Tsst]]"". To manage Cartman's behavioral issues, she hires [[Cesar Millan]]. Cesar's methods work, and Cartman becomes a normal, good natured, well behaved boy. Liane tries to form a relationship with Cesar, but he turns her down as she is just a client, and she soon begins to spoil Cartman again—as this boy is the closest thing to a friend she really has. However, Liane seems to be one of the only humans whom Cartman genuinely cares about; it was only his much-repressed conscience that kept him from killing her in the same episode. She does not mind doing stuff that is completely gross, as seen in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", when she takes a bedpan down to the basement where the boys are playing Warcraft and lets Cartman crap into the bedpan that she is holding.. In the later seasons, she has been shown to be strict with him as seen in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", and ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"" all of which show her not only following through with punishments, but also showing obvious disgust with Cartman's behaviour. Still, despite her taking a more firm stance with Cartman, Liane will still often spoil him, due in large to part to pre-emptively avoid his tantrums as seen in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"".

Cartman places his mother second on his 'Shit List', seen in ""[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole|The Fractured But Whole]]"" with Kyle as first on the list. This implies he has a strong hatred for her, however he is defensive of her whenever her promiscuous nature comes into question during earlier seasons, as well as being disturbed during ""[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]"" to discover she was a star in a German pornographic video. With this factored against his outrageous acts against her, it can be seen that he has a strong loathing of her and yet has some form of caring about her at the same time.

[[File:CartmansMomIsaDirtySlut006.png|thumb|Cartman having a tea party with his dolls in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"".]]
Cartman has a cat named [[Mr. Kitty]], and a pot-bellied pig named [[Fluffy]] Mr. Kitty and Fluffy have never been seen together in the series thus far. He also has a stuffed frog toy named [[Clyde Frog]]. Other beloved stuffed animals include Wellington Bear (a take on Paddington Bear), Polly Prissypants the rag doll, purple lizard Rumpertumskin (a take on Rumpelstiltskin), and Peter Panda. Cartman nearly always plays with these toys by himself, perhaps out of embarrassment or (just as likely) mean-spiritedness. Occasionally others are allowed to play with him, such as [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"". Cartman's games with these toys can demonstrate his vindictive and cruel nature; one of his games, as seen in aforementioned episode, is ""Lambs"", in which Cartman reenacts scenes from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" with his dolls, such as placing a doll in a pit in his basement and then voicing the doll begging to be released while the doll holding it prisoner threatens the pit-bound doll. Often Cartman's games involve the toys telling him how cool and smart he is, and he directs towards them an affection which is not seen towards any other person except his mom. Oddly enough, during one incident in which Cartman's toys were 'praising' him, one of the toys called him a 'fat piece of crap' which was a surprise to Cartman himself. Considering Cartman was voicing the toys, this could imply that a small part of a Cartman despises himself, and that the insult was a subconscious slip. In ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"", when a group leaves to conduct a rescue mission, all the group members say goodbye to a person close to each of them, except Cartman who bids farewell to Clyde Frog.

:Cartman: ''""I... don't want you to worry about me.""''
:Clyde Frog: ""''(Clyde Frog just sits there)""''
:Cartman: ""''Hey, you're the best stuffed animal I ever had.""''

In the [[Season Twelve]] episode, ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"", although Cartman had given Kyle AIDS as punishment for Kyle laughing at him for having HIV, Kyle angrily breaks many of Cartman's toys in reaction. Among these toys, he rips off Clyde Frog's head. In ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"", Clyde Frog is seen on the chalkboard in Cartman's morning announcements implying that Cartman has fixed him.

In ""[[1%]]"", someone begins destroying Cartman's toys after he was told to grow up. He is seen with a new toy, Muscleman Marc. Clyde Frog is stabbed and nailed to a tree with the word VENGEANCE underneath. Then, Peter Panda is set on fire while Cartman was asleep, which burns his room. Later, Cartman takes them to Tolkien's house, convinced that ""black people are incapable of doing anything wrong."" The toys soon disappear, leading Cartman to find Muscleman Marc inside a pot of boiling water, and Rumpertumskin chained with a bomb collar, which Cartman inadvertally sets off, blowing its head off. Cartman finds Polly Prissypants in a chair, with a revolver. The act is dropped when we see Cartman voicing Polly as she ""confesses"" to the murders, claiming that the others were right, that Cartman had to grow up. So she killed the other toys and planned on framing Tolkien, but Cartman reminds her that because of Obama, black people cannot be blamed. In desperation, Polly asks Cartman to kill her, which he reluctantly does. The other boys watched, and realized that this was Cartman's delusional way of getting rid of his stuffed animals.
Cartman, though incapable of empathy towards people, exhibits a strong bond with cats despite being a speciesist. In ""[[Major Boobage]]"", cats are made illegal because Kenny, along with several other kids around the country, begins using male cat musk as a hallucinogenic drug. Cartman lies to the police, claiming that he had his cat put down when he really is hiding his cat in the attic. Throughout the episode he collects abandoned cats in his attic out of sympathy. His cat has been on the show since the series began, and his love for cats could have developed from his lack of other family members besides his mother; he has no father or siblings. This empathetic relationship is reserved for cats and not humans; he does not (or more likely chooses not to) recognize a parallel between his cat safe-haven to the history of Jews hiding from Nazi soldiers during the Holocaust, which Kyle points out.

[[File:ThePoorKid026.png|thumb|Cartman angry at Kyle.]]
The rivalry between Cartman and Kyle has been a recurring theme from the beginning, but has become significantly stronger since [[Season Four]]. Cartman appears to have a very strong hatred for Kyle, and shows that he has no tolerance for Kyle's Jewish faith. Kyle hates him in turn. However, neither one of them seems to realize the effects of their almost poisonous relationship, and continue to live in close contact with each other.

In [[Season Five]], Cartman and Kyle's relationship meets a turning point, going from a relationship of them simply ripping on each other constantly to near hatred simply because Cartman [[Kenny Dies|caused Kenny's semi-permanent death]]. It was around [[Season Eleven]] that they began their descent from love-hate to full on hatred.

However, in the ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", during the scene where Cartman has Butters apologize to all of his peers in his stead (as he believes he is a ghost), he seems to wish to recant some of his earlier misdeeds towards Kyle (and obtain his forgiveness), and seems genuinely moved upon seeing him.

Kyle is often put in the shoes of the protagonist to Eric Cartman's antagonist. For example, in ""[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]"", the two of them work against each other; when Cartman tries to get [[Family Guy]] canceled, Kyle tries to stop him. The two of them often have arguments about morals, like in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", where Cartman decides to pretend to be mentally handicapped so he can win the ""Special Olympics"".

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', when they were facing certain death, Cartman tried to atone for all the times he called Kyle ""A big dumb Jew"", telling him ""''I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew''"". Bewildered, Kyle replies that he is indeed a Jew, and Cartman tells him not to be so hard on himself (implying that Jew was an insult rather than a religion).

Cartman also has attempted to murder Kyle more than once, the most significant incident being in a scene from ""[[Toilet Paper]]"" in which he lures Kyle into going rowing with him to the middle of [[Stark's Pond]], and then, when Kyle's back is turned, attempts to bludgeon him to death with a wiffle bat, without comprehending the stupidity of the plan. When he learns someone has confessed to the crime he, Kyle, Stan and Kenny had committed, thus eliminating the need to kill Kyle who was going to confess himself, Cartman asks Stan (in his usual trademark-pathetic way) if he can still kill Kyle. Cartman tries to murder Kyle again in ""[[Fatbeard]]"".

However, in ""[[Smug Alert!]]"", Cartman saves Kyle and his family when a large storm is about to go towards their house in San Francisco. Cartman finds Butters as too boring a nemesis since he will simply accept anything Cartman directs at him, and realizes that in order to have someone with which to argue incessantly again he must get Kyle back. At the end of the episode he hides the fact that he was the savior of Kyle's whole family, opting to insult Kyle again instead; Kyle replies angrily and storms off, to Cartman's satisfaction. In the episode ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"" when Kyle (unintentionally) saves Cartman from shouting out all his secrets on Dateline (Cartman had originally intended to use fake Tourette's so as to deliver a hate-speech against Jews), Cartman hugs Kyle and thanks him, even saying ""I love you, man."" In the episode ""[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]"", when Kyle falls into a cavern and asks from the bottom, ""''Is Cartman there?''"" he responds with a sincere ""''I'm here, Kyle!''"". Of course this only occurs after Cartman suggests they leave Kyle for dead and continue to their search for crocodiles. In the episode ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", Cartman defends Kyle saying, ""Broflovski's a good cop!""

Cartman's obsessive hatred of Kyle above almost all others, has called into question Cartman's deeper feeling for Kyle. In the episode ""[[Imaginationland]]"", Cartman wins a bet with Kyle which requires Kyle to suck his balls, and goes to various extreme measures throughout the Imaginationland trilogy to make Kyle do so, including going to the Supreme Court and breaking into the Pentagon (twice). In the end of the trilogy's first part, Cartman is seen with a photo of an innocent looking Kyle. The scene ends with Cartman dragging his finger slowly across Kyle's mouth in the photo, which could be interpreted as an act of lust, this further hints at a confused sexuality. At the end of the trilogy's third part, Cartman conjures up an imaginary Kyle to suck the balls of an imaginary Cartman.

Cartman also, in the episode ""[[Go God Go XII]]"", offers to suck Kyle's balls (after Kyle said ""Suck my balls, Cartman""), in exchange for Kyle's help in getting Cartman back from the distant future. In the episode ""[[Fatbeard]]"", Kyle encourages Cartman to run away to [[Somalia]], hoping that he will die. Cartman also seems to have no qualms about seriously invading Kyle's personal space, as shown in a scene from ""[[ManBearPig]]"" wherein Cartman, while contemplating his hatred for Kyle, looms a mere inch or two from Kyle's face as he sleeps; soon Kyle wakes up and yells, ""''Dude, get away from me!''""

However, the fact that Kyle challenges Cartman more than any other character in the series, may in fact be the core reason for Cartman's obsessive fixation on him. In ""[[Fatbeard]]"", he says that Kyle has ""finally come to terms with his disability"" and seemed more willing to kill Kyle later in the episode by making his walk the plank over an alligator. As of ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"", he seems to be more passive toward Kyle, greeting him with only "" 'Sup, Jew?"". This passive attitude however seemed to be only temporary, as seen in ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", in which during [[Towelie (Character)|Towelie]]'s intervention on national TV, each of the boys is asked to read a pre-written statement about their feelings for Towelie. Cartman however instead reads off a long-winded hate speech against the Jewish people (most likely the one he intended to use during ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]""), where he urges the rest of the country to help him in rising up against the Jews and in which most of his speech is directed primarily towards Kyle.

The two have occasionally gotten along such as in ""[[Kenny Dies]]"" and ""[[Pinkeye]]"" when Kyle put his hand on Cartman's shoulder when was upset about Kenny dying. In fact, in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"", Cartman helped Kyle make new friends, even though Cartman did not appear to be gaining anything out of it. In ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", Kyle was ironically the one who saved Cartman when he was being raped by [[Snooki]]. Cartman showed genuine appreciation for this act, thanking him and later going as far as to say that although Kyle was a ""monster"" (for having Jersey blood running through his veins), he was ""my [Cartman's] little monster"", and pinched his cheek. Although they bicker constantly, the two have not full on fought since then, and have had a lot more moments together where they seem happy, such as Kyle sharing music with Cartman in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"". There are also moments such as in ""[[Faith Hilling]]"" where the two share a common goal. However, there are many moments where they are at ends like earlier in the series, such as in the Coon trilogy. Therefore, their friendship is in a constant state of disrepair.

The back-and-forth of their outward conflict yet still regularly meeting with the other boys can be seen as somewhat ironic. Therefore, Kyle and Cartman could be seen to have a more complex connection than Stan and Kyle with . In [[The Entity|""The Entity""]], Kyle described Cartman as ""my sort of friend-ish"", as his best explanation of their relationship.

In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", Stan's behavior change upon turning 10 causes a rift to develop occurs in his friendships with Kyle, Cartman and Kenny to the point where they no longer wish to interact with him. As a result, at the episode's end with Cartman and Kyle playing video games together, the pair offer each other kind smiles, showing their friendship growing even further.

In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", Kyle and Cartman have quite a few friendly moments together. Although they are shown bickering, the argument is not angry as most of the arguments between the two can be. Kyle is quick to support Cartman in his new business, even going so far as to tell Stan that they ca not be friends anymore because he is with Cartman Burgers now. When Stan shows up, drunk, talking to Kyle, it is shown that Cartman is keeping a close eye on them from where he was standing. He even eventually comes over to check if Kyle is okay, giving Stan a distasteful look. However, this is rapidly tarnished by the episode's end when Kyle discovers his method for producing his burgers.

In ""[[Jewpacabra]]"", Cartman constantly rips on Jews throughout the episode, even to the point of making up a Jewish creatures that eats children in Easter egg hunts. When Cartman believes that the creature could be real and is chained so the creature can eat him, he is tranquilized and is hazed. Kyle finds him and takes him home and puts him to bed. The next day, at the [[Sooper Foods]] Easter egg hunt, Cartman claims that he is Jewish and knows how Kyle feels.

Cartman and Stan's friendship is clearly existent but it is very tense. In fact, when Kyle and Kenny are not around, he and Stan often do not show a close friendship with each other or rarely interact one-on-one.

In ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"", Stan and Cartman hang out at the boating rack, and Cartman even comments that it is great that they are hanging out with each other without Kyle, to which Stan does not disagree to, implying that Stan somewhat shares these feelings. Stan also agrees with Cartman in the episode, such as not telling Kyle he caused the dam to break, and not telling [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] he was the one who broke the dam.

Cartman's song ""[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]"" was joined by all the other classmates (minus Kyle of course), even getting Stan's attention in which Stan actually enjoys the song.

In ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", while Kyle is immediately distrustful of Cartman's claim that he cannot control the actions of his hand (which has seemed to take on a life of its own), Stan gives Cartman the benefit of the doubt and admits that, with all the stuff that happens in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], Cartman could be telling the truth. Cartman and Stan were also seen interacting one on one in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"" when Kyle, Kenny and Butters were away at the Karne Institute for Sex Addicts and they were playing with each other on the domestic violence/golf video game [[Tiger Woods|Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2011]] at Cartman's house and they were getting along just fine with no arguments. When the boys were playing street hockey in ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", Stan was the only one he did not insult, referring to him as ""Marsh"", as any commentator would, as opposed to Kyle and Kenny, who he referred to as ""the Jew"" and ""the Poor Kid"", respectively.

In ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"", Cartman made Stan the protagonist of his Christmas story (he is described as 'the boy in a red poof-ball hat'). Everyone but Kyle likes the story, including Stan. The fact that Stan is portrayed normally in the Christmas story hints that Stan is Cartman's friend, unlike Kyle, who is portrayed as evil. In ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", Stan votes for Cartman's mascot instead of Kyle's, much to Kyle's dismay. Also, in the episode ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"", when Stan appears to be the only boy who has not gotten their period, Cartman reassures him that he will get it one day. However, in ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"", Cartman declares that he hates Stan because Stan loves animals. Even so, in the episode ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"", all three boys de-friend Stan after he becomes the leader of Scientology. As the boys leave, Cartman turns to Stan and says, ""''I still hate Kyle more than you''"". In ""[[Fun with Veal]]"", when Cartman was negotiating for weapons and an escape route for him and the rest of the boys, he is at first reluctant to meet the demands of [[Glen Dumont|the timid FBI negotiator]], but soon agreed to his conditions when he looked at Stan and recognized the sores (which were actually mini-vaginas) on his body and his deteriorating health. This implies that Cartman cares about Stan's well-being to an extent. Another reference to their friendship is in ""[[Pee]]"" when Cartman notices that Kyle, Stan, Butters and Jimmy are still alive he instantly hugs Stan, running past Kyle.

In some episodes Stan is shown having a strong hatred for Cartman even if Cartman is not doing anything. In ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"" when the cyborg says he has to kill Cartman, Stan asks if he can do it, and prepares to shoot Cartman before the cyborg decides against the idea. In ""[[Spookyfish]]"" Stan is fully for sending Cartman away forever. Although Stan is much more tolerant of Cartman than Kyle is, he often holds Cartman in very high contempt for his unacceptable behaviour. In ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", when Mr. Mackey claimed that Cartman killed himself for being fat when the school faculty ""threw him under the bus"", Stan was only concerned with preventing Eavesdropper from publishing the biggest story.

In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", Cartman ends his friendship with Stan rather quickly after Stan's personality change, and soon begins getting along better Kyle, who also ends his friendship with Stan. Though, they did become friends again in ""[[Ass Burgers]]"".

[[File:KennyDies043.png|thumb|Cartman cries outside of Kenny's hospital room.]]
Because of Cartman's selfish personality, his friendship with Kenny is not as obvious as Stan and Kyle's, and it sometimes looks fake, but it is clearly existent. They are also shown to share a sense of humor, as can be seen in the episode ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"" when Kenny and Cartman continue an elaborate joke, despite Stan and Kyle's objections.

However, Cartman has at times displayed a special dislike for Kenny, often without any reason; most often, he shows contempt for Kenny's family living in poverty. In two separate episodes, ""[[Chickenpox]]"" and ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"", Cartman is heard singing the song ""[[In the Ghetto|In The Ghetto]]"" in order to tease Kenny. In ""[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]"", Kenny and Cartman are alone in the scene, and Cartman blurts out ""I hate you, Kenny"" out of nowhere. In the episode ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"", Cartman makes up a song called ""I Hate You Guys"" where he sings:[[File:SuperFunTime103.png|thumb|left|Cartman and Butters suffer great injuries together during ""[[Super Fun Time]]"".]]
Butters has become Cartman's most frequent victim. Butters sees Cartman as his good friend and treats him as so but in later episodes he treats Cartman the same as everybody else. But, Cartman takes advantage of this and finds Butters extremely easy to manipulate and convert to his point of view, or get him to do what he wants. In ""[[Douche and Turd]]"" Cartman easily gets Butters to vote for his idea of a ""turd sandwich"" simply by describing the candidates in a certain way. In ""[[Go God Go]]"" he gets Butters to bury him in snow so that he can be unfrozen three weeks later in time for the release of the Wii video game console.

In many episodes entire plots are centered on Cartman's antics against Butters. In ""[[Casa Bonita]]"", Cartman faked an apocalypse so Butters would hide in a bomb shelter for over a week, so Cartman could go with Kyle, Stan, and Kenny to Casa Bonita instead of Butters. In ""[[AWESOM-O]]"" he dressed as a robot to trick Butters, but in the end this failed miserably and Butters happily showed a tape of Cartman dressed like Britney Spears in front of everyone for revenge. In the episode ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", Butters does another one at Cartman while he is beaten down by Tolkien, by farting on his face giving him the finger while saying ""fuck you Eric"", for his repeated blasphemy and ruining their band. He also taunts Cartman for being the real 'ugliest' kid in their class and mocks his neo-Nazism in a deleted scene in the episode ""[[The List]]"".

In ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"" all of the kids at [[South Park Elementary]] decide to ignore Cartman because they feel he is a ""son of a bitch"". Unlike the other boys, Butters is not aware of the plan and Cartman believes that Butters is the only one who can see him, now that he is ""dead"". In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"" he repeatedly invited Butters over to spend the night to play pranks on him, until it backfired on him and he made an inappropriate picture which featured him putting Butter's penis in his mouth, and which ended up being showed to the entire fourth grade class, humiliating Cartman instead of Butters. In the episode ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", after Cartman gets brutalized by [[Wendy]], Butters agreed with [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] that he always hated Cartman with everyone else. However, ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", Cartman shows as much compassion as the other boys towards Butters after he is queefed upon, and even gives him a present, as well as participating in a state-wide attempt to ban queefing with Butters as a mascot, suggesting some compassion for Butters although he, like the others, refuses to go near Butters after he was queefed on. Cartman also ""punishes"" Butters with the tetherball for not kissing another girl in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", though later he would praise Butters for kissing a girl for 5 bucks. In the episode ""[[Pee]]"" when everybody is rescued Butters is disappointed that Cartman did not die.

Cartman has the tendency to pull pranks on Butters while he is asleep. This is most apparent in ""[[Asspen]]"" and ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"". One of which is to place a warm glass of water under Butter's hand and then urinate on him. Also in ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"" while [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] got grounded by his parents, Cartman decided to cover for Butters while Stan and Kyle tried to get 4 million dollars when Butters' parents told him they would call him on the phone every hour.

In ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", Cartman was assigned and paired up with Heidi to take of an egg for a school assignment, later when Cartman broke the egg he begged [[Herbert Garrison|Ms. Garrison]] to give her an ""A"" and give him an ""F"", this could possibly prove that Cartman cares and has feelings for her, however in later episodes it does not show much of them having a relationship. It is also likely that he said this to get a better grade, because the A and F average out to a C, whereas two F's would mean Cartman failed.

In ""[[The Damned]]"", Heidi Turner and Cartman form a relationship when she gives him a glimpse of life outside social media. Following that, in ""[[Wieners Out]]"", it is revealed by Cartman the two are now a couple and he claims to be wiser from the experience.

In ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"", they both work together to help Denmark put an end to internet trolling. They even sing ""[[Let's Come Together As a School]]"" in a vain attempt to unify the boys and girls at [[South Park Elementary]].

In ""[[Fort Collins]]"", Cartman is unable to tell Heidi about his past bigotry, out of fear of being dumped. He lies to her and blames the incidents on [[Jimmy Valmer]]. In order to further prevent the truth from coming out, the two journey to [[SpaceX]] in ""[[Oh, Jeez]]"" to get to [[Mars]]. 

Focused on her ""Emoji Analysis"" in ""[[Not Funny]]"", Heidi begins to focus more on her work, rather than Cartman. Cartman laments to Butters about this, who tries to convince him that Heidi will ""leave poop on his heart"".

At the end of [[Season Twenty]], in ""[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]"", Heidi and Eric stay together, although Eric is disappointed in her.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] premiere episode, ""[[White People Renovating Houses]]"", their relationship becomes stained. Cartman begins to be annoyed with Heidi for not being submissive to him. He blames her for his unhappiness in their relationship, accusing her of being mentally abusive. At the end of the episode, Cartman breaks up with Heidi, and leaves her heartbroken. Despite this, it is revealed in the following episode, ""[[Put It Down]]"", that Cartman truly does love Heidi, as he leaves Heidi a voicemail, threatening her that he will commit suicide if she does not take him back. Worried about him, Heidi accepts this, and they get back together.

The toxicity of their relationship plays a large role in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, ""[[Sons A Witches]]"". In the episode, Cartman grows frustrated with Heidi for taking so long to get ready when they planned to go to the pumpkin patch together. Instead of telling her how he felt, he attempts to spare her feelings and therefore any guilt he'd feel for telling her by irrationally attempting to get rid of her. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] reprimands Cartman for this, saying that “Heidi is a nice girl”, and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her, adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly. Cartman dismisses this, and later he convinces Heidi to dress up as Gretel, while dressing himself up as Hansel. Immediately after he takes Heidi into the woods with him at night, and ultimately ditches her in the woods to die, and gets her kidnapped by a witch. She is rescued at the end of the episode, much to Cartman's dismay.

Their relationship plays its most significant role to date in the seventh episode of Season Twenty-One. It was revealed in the episode, ""Doubling Down"", that Heidi tolerates Cartman's abuse towards her because she does not want to admit she made a mistake when she became his girlfriend. These feelings are directly influenced by the other girls, who laugh at her, and tease her for ever dating him, albeit playfully. They also expressed concern for Heidi's sanity, and her safety while in her relationship with Cartman, all holding a personal vendetta against him. Kyle addresses this and politely asks the girls to cease their teasing because it is making her feel insecure about herself. The girls assume that Kyle has feelings for Heidi, leading Kyle to question his relationship with her, and he soon develops an interest in her. After breaking up with Cartman, Heidi agrees to be Kyle's girlfriend, angering Cartman. Cartman recognizes Heidi's confusion about what she wants, and uses this to manipulate her into betraying her healthy diet, and contort her beliefs, making her unintentionally prejudice against Jews.

Cartman is known to taunt Wendy for her liberal and environmentalist views, and often refers to her as a hippie or a tree hugger. However, in ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", after they were working together on the flag debate, he entertained her by talking through two action figures. During this encounter, they found out that they had a lot in common with each other. When Wendy kissed him at the presentation to get her emotions out of her system, he was pleased and facially bragged to Stan about it. He later seemed dejected when Wendy told him her feelings for him were gone which obviously proved he fancied her. It is believed his taunting of her is his way of ""pulling pigtails"".

[[File:ChefGoesNanners082.png|thumb|Wendy kissing Cartman.]]
In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", after Wendy grows adult-sized breasts Cartman and the other boys laugh at her and Cartman calls her a ""stupid bitch.""

In the episode ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", Cartman treats Wendy's plea for breast cancer awareness as a joke, and subsequently she beats him up, leaving him in a pool of his own blood.

Despite this, Cartman may still have a sexual attraction to Wendy seen in Cartman's inaccurate flashbacks and imaginations in ""[[Fishsticks]]"": when Cartman ""killed a dragon"" and ""saved South Park from the Jew-Bots"" as Wendy showers him in praise as he basks in it.

Cartman seems to grow more hate and always assaults Wendy when he gets any chance in ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"" as he may still hold a grudge against Wendy after being beaten up by her in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]] "".

Cartman is the only one to say greet Wendy in ""[[Pinkeye]]"" when she meets up with the others to go trick-or-treating, and says it in a nice tone. However, Cartman could have liked the fact that Wendy humiliated Stan.

In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", Cartman says that Wendy has huge boobs; this could be him trying to impress her by saying she looks attractive. Also, this is one episode after ""[[Chef Goes Nanners|Chef goes Nanners]]"", which is when Wendy kissed Cartman, implying that Cartman still likes Wendy.

Wendy and Cartman have both killed people, and both have made psychotic and sadistic faces and actions; in ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", Wendy watches [[Ms. Ellen]] get rocketed into the sun and says in a sweet, creepy voice, ""Bye - bye Ms. Ellen"", then puts then on a smiling, psychoeyed face saying, ""Don't. Fuck. With. Wendy. TESTABURGER!""; In ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", Cartman had informed Scott Tenorman of his parents' death with a smile and a creepy voice; he also taunts him, saying, ""Na na na na na na, I made you eat your parents, Na na na na na na.""; Cartman then licks Scotts tears saying, ""Let me lick your tears Scott. MMM, they're so yummy and sweet. The tears of unfathomable sadness. MMM, yummy, yummy you guys."". This shows that the two are alike in mental health; homicidal and sadistic, which could be something for them to bond over.

In ""[[The Cissy]]"", Wendy uses the transgender bathroom to get back at him.

Although Cartman does not generally like anyone in particular, he was very fond of Chef, as seen in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"" where Cartman was crying in front of Butters and even admitted that he was going to miss Chef, but did not know how to tell him. He normally used to go to Chef with his problems, and Chef was always willing to help him. Chef even helped Cartman get Kenny's soul out of his body, before it killed him.

However, when Cartman was creating a crew to free the town from the hippies, he chose Chef as the black man to sacrifice himself later. It should be noted that before Cartman found out that Liane was his father, he had been told that Chef was his father. And despite Chef's willingness to help Cartman, he like everyone else in town, is more than willing to insult Cartman and call him fat.

Throughout the series, Cartman shows a special dislike for Craig. He usually tries to prove Craig wrong and annoy him. In many episodes Craig competes against Cartman and shows satisfaction when he has advantages. This can be seen ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"" or ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", where Cartman declares wrathfully ""God, I hate Craig! That son of a bitch!"". In another episode Cartman tries to go to Craig when runs from home, but Craig tells him he hates him and shuts the door in his face. However, whenever all the boys join forces for a common cause, such as in ""[[Marjorine]]"", ""[[Imaginationland]]"" or ""[[The List]]"", Craig is usually Cartman's right-hand man. In ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", Cartman trained Craig in sumo wrestling. In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", Cartman is the most excited in showing off their weapons to Craig. In ""Skank Hunt"", he along with Stan, Kyle, Butters, Clyde, Jimmy and Tolkien smash Cartman's electronics due to them thinking that he is Skankhunt42.

Ever since ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", Clyde seems to show great respect for Cartman, since he went through everyone calling him a fat ass. Everyone seems to be shocked whenever Clyde stands up for Cartman, especially Cartman (one example was in ""[[Marjorine]]""). Clyde joined Cartman's pirate crew in ""[[Fatbeard]]"". He is also always in Cartman's groups whenever Cartman assembles a group against other enemies. In ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"", he invited Cartman to participate in his birthday party at ""Casa Bonita"". After watching the [[Terrance and Phillip]] commercial in the episode ""[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]"", he immediately calls Clyde and goes to his house to watch it again. Furthermore, in [[You Have 0 Friends]], Cartman encourages people to add Clyde as a friend on [[Facebook]]. However, in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", Clyde is reluctant to join the Cartman-led attack on the [[Jenkins|the griefer]], and ultimately no-shows as he is more preoccupied looking at a ''Playboy'' centerfold than playing the game. Cartman also once slingshotted Clyde in the balls for his own (and, as he later defended his actions in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]]'s) amusement. In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"" Clyde joins Stan, Kyle, Butters, Jimmy, Craig and Tolkien to smash all of Cartman's electronics due them think that he is [[Skankhunt42]].

It appears that Cartman has a strong hatred for Clyde, as shown by his ""Shit List"" in ""[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole|The Fractured But Whole]]"" where he placed Clyde 3rd for his most hated person, after Kyle and Liane Cartman respectively.
Cartman has a mixed relationship with Tolkien Black, although it is mostly negative, displayed by his use of stereotypes and general, reoccurring meanness to him. Tolkien really hates Cartman because he is generally racist toward numerous minority groups, including black people. In ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", when Tolkien constantly mocks Cartman about his weight, and Kyle after provokes him, Cartman throws a rock Tolkien. However, after being released from prison and after winning the race against the girls, Cartman vows to never take his friends for granted again, much to Tolkien's delight, who starts to warm up to him. In ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"", Cartman makes fun of him because he is rich and wealthy. In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", Cartman got beat up by Tolkien after he wasted money that they made and scared their crowd away; he also racially insinuated that Tolkien could play bass guitar on the grounds that he was black, which turned out to be true. Him, Butters and Tolkien have their own album, Wendy's best friend, Bebe, often shows hatred for Cartman, as he does for her. In ""[[Raisins]]"", Bebe tells Stan that Wendy wants to break up with Stan, leading to a heated argument between Cartman and Bebe, Cartman calls Bebe a whore numerous times to which Bebe calls Cartman a fat ass. In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"" at the beginning of the episode, all of the kids are seen playing Call of Duty: World At War. Cartman is shot and killed by someone within the game and he says, ""''Ah! Who just shot me?!''"", and Bebe leans away from her computer and flips Cartman off, saying that she killed him within the game, when Cartman's character respawns, he immediately attacks Bebe and refers to her as a ""bitch"". Also, in ""[[The List]]"", When Bebe refused to give him the list, Cartman says: ""''Fuck you, Bebe! Fucking bitch!''"". He also disagress with Bebe about farts in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"". In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Cartman role plays ''Silence of the Lambs'' with his dolls with Bebe. The two get on well together, although this was only due to her breasts.

In ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"", when Cartman's fake Tourette's become real, he reveals to everyone that he is in love with Patty Nelson, and that he fantasizes kissing her. Upon hearing this however, Patty Nelson looks horrified as she mutters ""Eww..."".
Jimmy is one of the kids that Cartman have manipulated sometimes, and sometimes becomes his rival in ""[[Craig's Gang]]"". However, Jimmy seems to be one of the few people that Cartman respects and is willing to do good deeds for. As shown in many episodes, he enjoys Jimmy's comedy and often goes to him whenever he needs advice. He was even willing to sacrifice himself to save Jimmy in ""[[Fishsticks]]"". Even though this was because Cartman believed he wrote Jimmy's joke and was in a way trying to take credit, the fact that he was willing to sacrifice himself to [[Kanye West]] to save Jimmy, this is still very noteworthy as one of the few times Cartman did a good deed without being promised anything in return. Jimmy also sometimes go to Cartman for advice, such as when Cartman helped Jimmy with his love life in ""[[Erection Day]]"". When he thought he lost his sense of humor in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"" he goes to Jimmy for help. However Cartman beats Jimmy up in [[Casa Bonita|""Casa Bonita]]"" in an attempt to gain Kyle's friendship even though Jimmy was trying to help Cartman.
[[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] has been shown working with Cartman on occasion, and is the only Jew that Cartman does not seem to discriminate against (although it is possible he does not know he is Jewish, which is unlikely due to events in ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]""). In the earlier seasons, Cartman seemed either indifferent or hostile to Ike, although recently he has started to work with him more. Ike joined Cartman's crew in ""[[Fatbeard]]"", and was the only Jew in the crew. He acted as Cartman's right-hand man and second in command, Cartman usually going to him when he needed something done.
Cartman is probably the only friend he has, Cartman and Jackson have a very good relationship together. In Stan's house when they were sleeping, he was sleeping next to him. Cartman also wanted to have a slumber party in his house. He also told everyone about Mr. Jefferson. All this occurs in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"".

Despite their previous friendship, he seemed to resent his presence in ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"" when he possessed Ike and may not have recognized him. Cartman was later seen with the rest of the boys cheering for him at the pageant and bribed the judge in order for him to win.
In ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"" Cartman shows surprising respect and loyalty to Billy Mays for introducing him to the product [[Chipotlaway]], which allows him to continue eating at Chipotle despite the fact that it causes blood to stain his underwear. Throughout the entire episode, Cartman is motivated solely by his desire to put Billy Mays' soul to rest, never once expressing any intention to gain anything from this endeavor in the process. Even at the end of the episode, by which time Cartman usually reveals his ulterior motive(s), Cartman still focuses on the fact that Billy Mays is at peace.

Cartman seems to have formed a genuine friendship with his cell-mate while he was in prison in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"" after Romper Stomper showed compassion to him when he was seen crying. Though Cartman seems to have held him little regard (as evidenced from when he attempted to run away from the prison while Romper-Stomper suffered an injury and stayed behind), he appears to have genuinely appreciated Romper-Stomper's help. After Cartman was released from prison, he visited Romper-Stomper again and pooped Disneyland (the place Romper-Stomper had always wanted to see) into the toilet for him with nothing to gain from it. In addition to his relationship with Billy Mays and [[Shelley Marsh]], Romper-Stomper is one of the few people which Cartman has done a good deed for without being promised anything in return.

Scott Tenorman is Cartman's half-brother and nemesis. Their first meeting was in [[Scott Tenorman Must Die|""Scott Tenorman Must Die""]], in which Scott sold Cartman his pubic hair, convincing Cartman it would signify maturity for him. When Cartman realized the truth, he then proceeded to attempt several fruitless revenge plots, until at last he created an elaborate scheme in which he had their father [[Jack Tenorman|Jack]], and [[Mrs. Tenorman]] killed, ground up into Chili and fed to Scott. This event drove Scott insane, and during his time in a mental institution he plotted his revenge. They met again in ""[[201]]"", in which Scott resurrected the [[Ginger Separatist Movement]] that Cartman created, as part of a complicated plan to get revenge on Cartman by revealing who his real father was. After capturing Cartman and all the surviving possible fathers of South Park and [[Liane Cartman]], Scott revealed that Cartman's father was a member of the [[Denver Broncos]], but that the town covered up the truth because they did not want to ruin the Bronco's season by spreading knowledge of an illegitimate child scandal. Scott then explains that his own father was a member of the Broncos, and the only one who lived in South Park. Cartman is horrified to learn that Scott's father was also his father. After feeding Cartman tainted chili, Scott escapes capture by means of a jet-pack. Scott's plan works however, in that Cartman is left in tears, not because his father is dead however, but because he is half-ginger.

Shelley babysits Cartman in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"", after his mom goes off to attend the Meteor Shower party. At first they are displeased with each other's presence, but then they appear to get along near the end. In fact, Cartman comforts Shelley when she feels insecure about her appearance and feels that no one likes her. Cartman tells her that he does not think she is ugly, which makes Shelley feel better. And they become friends after Cartman convinces her to dump her boyfriend Skyler deeming him a jerk.

In ""[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]"", when Shelley walks in the living room and changes the channel while the boys are watching TV, Cartman tries to manipulate Shelley into letting the boys continue watching by telling her that he thinks she is hot. Shelley is visibly angered by this remark.

Most people at school regularly and openly despise and hate Cartman for being selfish and mean spirited, also mocking him for his weight (which has lead Cartman to be extremely insecure, going as far to be known to dismember children when they insult his weight), but most of the time Cartman seems to have a on and off relationship with everyone in in town. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and possibly [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and Kenny, however, seem to be the only ones aware of how dangerous and mentally imbalanced he is, as well as the only ones who try to keep others from falling into his manipulation. Eric has also been portrayed as somewhat of a bully; he always insults new kids with offensive, often profane words, usually never leaving them alone. He physically abuses others, both through his fists and weapons (such as when he hit [[Tolkien Black]] and [[Pip Pirrip]] with rocks). He is also shown to be very vulgar and disgusting, doing things like holding people down and farting on them and making them smell his rectum. He also tells extremely dirty jokes. While many of his male peers think this is funny (especially [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]), it often causes the girls to despise him. Cartman is heavily implied to only pick on others because of the insecurity he has acquired from others calling him fat. Also, despite their hatred of him, all the kids seem to accept him as a leader because of his ability to manipulate people, and sometimes invite him to social events such as parties and vice versa. In ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"" particularly, it is implied that Stan, Kyle, and Kenny only hang around with Cartman because they cannot find other friends or vice versa; [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] states that everyone at school hates them, of which [[The Boys|the boys]] immediately dismiss.

The students at South Park Elementary are all apparently aware of Cartman's stuffed animals and his mental health as shown in ""[[1%]]"", where Craig tells Cartman he should go home and cry to his stuffed animals. However, in the same episode, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny express concern over Cartman's safety and keep a lookout at Tolkien's house to protect him.

*'''Filing a false police report''': In ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", he lies to the police about his parents abusing him.
*'''Cannibalism:''' In ""[[Pinkeye]]"", Kenny started taking bites out of anyone and everyone, turning them into zombies. Since he was a zombie himself, however, this would be forgivable.
*'''Kidnapping:''' In ""[[Cow Days]]"", Kenny, along with Stan and Kyle, took Cartman from the hospital for the purpose of him entering the bull-riding contest at the rodeo. Cartman had not actually healed and thought he was a Vietnamese prostitute called Ming Lee. Since this was for the purpose of money, it would be considered illegal.
*'''Violation of firearm laws:''' The sniper rifle Kenny carried is definitely illegal and unregistered. It was never explained how Kenny obtained the sniper rifle, but it is likely he obtained during the events of ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"" when he attempted to kill Cartman after he ruined the [[NASCAR]] sport's reputation.
*'''Breaking and entering:''' In ""[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]"", Kenny along with the boys broke into the rich kid's houses to trick their parents into giving them money, and steal it off of them.

*'''Arson:''' In ""[[Butt Out]]"", Kenny along with the boys threw their cigarettes into a nearby dumpster to prevent from getting caught by [[Mr. Mackey]] but later ignites and proceeds to burn the whole school down. In ""[[Pre-School]]"", Kenny, still kindergartener, along with the boys, were trying to play firemen. They decided that they should start a fire, so they had their classmate [[Trent Boyett|Trent]] start the fire and when they try to urinate out the fire it eventually got worse and burned the entire school down, but put the blame on Trent.
*'''Prostitution:''' In ""[[Fat Camp]]"", while promoting the ''[[Krazy Kenny Show]]'', Kenny competed with [[Tom Green]] and [[Johnny Knoxville]] to see who would give [[Howard Stern]] a ""hummer"" for the least amount of money. Kenny was willing to go for $10, which forced Knoxville and Green to submit, and he was eventually arrested and jailed for prostitution, forcing a lookalike to do the final stunt (and, as a result, die) on the show.
*'''Framing/blackmailing:''' In ""[[Pre-School]]"", Kenny along with the boys framed [[Trent Boyett|Trent]] for starting the fire (which he did), However Kenny, Kyle, Stan, and Cartman are responsible for making the fire worse, which caused the school to burn down and gave [[Miss Claridge]] severe burns. In [[Cancelled]], while in [[Planet Fognl]], Kenny took a picture of the two head ""[[Joozians]]"" sucking on each other's ""jagons"" and sticking their fingers in each other's ""thrushers"", Kenny and the others later used it against them which saved the world so it would be forgivable.
*'''Pedophilia:''' In ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"", during the ending Kenny takes full possession of [[Rob Schneider]], While possessed he attempted to kiss [[Millie Larsen]], which caused South Park civilians (unaware that he was being possessed) to think he was a pedophile. However, this action was shown in the form of a commercial, possibly indicating that this was in fact just a scene from a Rob Schneider movie.
*'''Vigilantism:''' In ""[[The Coon]]"", (before his identity was revealed) he took the role of Mysterion. Later after defeating both [[Butters Stotch|Professor Chaos]] and [[Dougie|General Disarray]], with the help from the [[Eric Cartman|Coon]] (who was trying to get rid of Mysterion), Mysterion attempted to remove his mask since he cannot risk putting people's lives in danger with every villain wondering who he is. After some deliberation, he reveals himself and gets arrested, much to the Coon's pleasure, despite people pleading with him not to. Although, this may have been [[Kyle Broflovski]] because in a deleted scene it is shown that Kyle pretended to be Mysterion so that the real Mysterion would not get in trouble. He reappeared as Mysterion again in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" (where his identity is revealed to the viewers), ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", and ""[[The Poor Kid]]"".

Like many of ''South Park'' 's characters, Kenny is based on a real person; in this case, a childhood friend of Trey Parker's also named Kenny. In a 2000 interview Trey said that the real life Kenny was the poorest kid in the neighborhood and wore an orange parka that made it difficult for anyone to understand what he was saying. Trey also stated that real life Kenny would skip school from time to time causing the others to jokingly say he had died, and a few days later, he would join his classmates and attend school again.In some episodes Kenny is known to do some crimes on his own, but not very often, in part due to him usually being selfless, albeit somewhat lecherous.

He has been arrested four times - once for prostitution, in which he gave [[Howard Stern]] a ""hummer"" for ten bucks, once for participating in Stan's Whale Wars crew, once for illegally downloading music, and once for vigilantism. However, he never stays in prison for long since the town is full of idiots. He may not actually have been arrested in ""[[The Coon]]"" because in a deleted scene, it shows that Kyle posed as Mysterion so Kenny would not get in trouble. Kenny's criminal record includes, but is not limited to:
:''See also: [[Kenny's Deaths]] and [[List of Kenny's Deaths]].''

[[File:KennyDeath1.png|thumb|left|Kenny Dies in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"".]]
Kenny McCormick is best known in the show for his recurring death in nearly every episode of the first five seasons, often followed by some variant of [[""Oh my God, they killed Kenny!""]] and ""You bastards!"" from his friends [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], respectively. The gag has many precedents, going back at least as far as the regular cry, ""You rotten swine! You've deaded me!"" by Bluebottle voiced by Peter Sellers in ""The Goon Show"" in 1951. In the first few episodes, Kyle said the entire phrase. Later on, it varied, depending on who killed Kenny.
Kenny has died and come back over 103 times in the franchise (86 in the series, to date, two in the early animated shorts, six in other authorized TV parodies, six times in the video game, and twice in the movie). [[File:KennyLightning.png|thumb|right|Kenny struck by lightning in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"".]] He has also been killed nine different ways in the opening sequence. Kenny's most recent death was in Season Fifteen episode, ""[[The Poor Kid]]"" when he is mauled by a [[Giant Reptilian Bird]]. Kenny died in almost all the episodes until the writers killed him off permanently in the fifth season, in ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", but he returned at the end of the next season's finale, ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", remarking that he has ""just been over there"" (pointing off-screen).

Although he does not appear in ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"", ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"", ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", or ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"", he technically is in them, as Cartman mixed his ashes with milk and drank it, causing his soul to be trapped inside of him. By the sixth season, Matt and Trey got rid of the practice of killing him in every episode; they got tired of the joke. The reason why Kenny died continuously was given in an interview with Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who stated vaguely that it was because Kenny is poor. Kenny is always resurrected for the next episode, although the explanations for his reappearance varied. In ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", it is explained that his soul returns to his mother, takes to another body, is reborn, and then grows to be 8 or 9 years old in record time (and somehow retaining physical appearance and memories), while another simply had Kenny magically reappearing out of thin air in the second part of the two-part episode ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"" after he was run over by a train in the first. The most recent explanation comes from the episode ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", in which Kenny himself reveals he is unable to stay dead and always wakes up in bed eventually, while nobody else remembers his death. However, in the next episode, ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", it is confirmed that, while he may wake up in his bed, it is indeed his mother that gives birth to him every time. Kenny's ""immortality"" may be connected with the [[Cult of Cthulhu]], as Carol mutters under her breath, ""I knew we should have never gone to those cult meetings.""

[[File:KennyFuneralTheRing.png|thumb|left|Kenny's funeral in ""[[The Ring]]"".]] 
None of the other characters seem to find this at all unusual. Stan merely greeted Kenny when he materialized, and no one else even blinked. Kenny himself is aware of the fact that he is constantly killed, expressing resentment over the fact that Stan was worried about Kyle's impending death while never mourning Kenny, and opting to take home economics classes over wood shop partly because he was afraid of getting killed by the dangerous power tools in the shop class, and cheering after realizing he had survived the episode ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"". In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", Kenny's will states ""In the highly likely event of my death..."" In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", he says to Hindsight ""Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, ""Oh, hey Kenny."" Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes."" This would suggest that Kenny is fully aware of his deaths, but nobody else is. In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", Kenny points out that nobody can remember his deaths. He even shoots himself in the head after a desperate plea to his friends to try and remember this time, but to no avail.

[[File:KennyFuneralSexualHealing.png|thumb|left|Kenny's funeral in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"".]]
Other characters occasionally seem to be vaguely aware of Kenny's deaths. In ""[[Cartmanland]]"", Kenny dies in Cartman's theme park, and when the lawyers suing him mention ""that boy who died,"" Cartman replies with, ""Who, Kenny? He dies all the time."" It would seem that the others are also aware of Kenny's deaths, but are quite nonchalant about them since they know he will re-appear. Stan and Kyle say their ""Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"" lines like they do not care in ""[[Gnomes]]"", in which the gnomes accidentally crush Kenny, and mourn over this tragedy, but are confused as to why the kids do not seem to care. In ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", Kenny eats antacid tablets, thinking they were mints, and drinks some water afterwards. When Kenny explodes, the four boys and Kyle's dad laugh and applaud, and Stan even says, ""That was a good one."" And in ""[[Fourth Grade]]"" Kenny dies on a wheeled sled and Stan says ""Well, who didn't see that coming."" In other episodes, however, Kenny's death is sometimes taken more seriously for plot purposes, especially in ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", where it is considered a major dramatic event in the boys' lives. In ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"" Stan at one point reacts incredulously to the idea Kenny could have ever died more than once, and Cartman agrees that it ""wouldn't make sense.""

[[File:KennyDeath2.png|thumb|right|Kenny's death in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"".]]
Kenny survives a few episodes in the first five seasons:
Kenny's family is one of the poorest families in South Park. His parents are both unstable alcoholics and occasional drug users, the former which was a trait that his father Stuart inherited from his own father.

Because Kenny's family is so poor, they eat frozen waffles with no side dishes for dinner and bread sandwiches for breakfast. In ""[[Starvin' Marvin]]"", Kenny won a can of green beans for his family, though they could not afford a can opener. In ""[[Sexual Healing]]"", Kenny's family ate microwave pizza. Cartman frequently exploits Kenny's poverty by offering him money for performing strange or dangerous tasks. In ""[[The List]]"", Cartman frequently mentions that his family eats Pop-Tarts for dinner. This is actually proven at the end of the episode; Kenny and his family are all seen eating Pop-Tarts before a stray bullet kills Kenny at the dinner table. In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"" it is shown that all of Kenny's possessions are kept in a small cardboard box. Though his family is extremely poor, his parents are known drug addicts and heavy drinkers. They drink so much that only a fairly large income would pay for it, which might explain the degree of poverty. In ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", it is suggested that the McCormicks make meth for a drug cartel and in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", they are arrested for having a meth lab.

Despite his family's poverty, Kenny always manages to stay current with trends in toys and video games, such as maintaining [[Make Love, Not Warcraft|a ''World of Warcraft'' subscription]] (and a computer to play it on), being the [[Best Friends Forever|first kid in South Park to get a PSP]], or [[Chinpokomon|being able to buy Chinpokomon dolls]] as well being the only child in the town to have a Go Go Action Bronco, a battery-powered miniature car. Kenny might have gotten these items from the odd jobs and dares from his friends and neighbors since his parents spend all their money on drugs and alcohol and eat whatever food is leftover. His mother was also able to afford $100 worth of [[Ritalin]] in ""Timmy 2000', although it caused him and all of his friends to be extremely boring. In [[Ginger Cow|""Ginger Cow""]], Kenny is seen recording with an iPhone, which seems to be his, as he was taking it with him away. He might have been able to afford an iPhone or got it from somebody.

Early versions of the character first appeared in Parker and Stone's two pre-''South Park'' shorts, ""''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]''"" (1992 and 1995). In the first ''Spirit of Christmas'' short, the character resembling Kenny is unnamed, while the character resembling [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is named Kenny. The unnamed Kenny-like character also speaks unmuffled in the first short. Both of these characters get killed in the short. In the second ''Spirit of Christmas'', a character with both Kenny's appearance and name appears and dies. Kenny's first ''South Park'' appearance within the series was alongside [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"".

Despite these problems, Kenny is often portrayed as the hero of the group; indeed, many of his deaths have been acts of heroic self-sacrifice. Among others, he fixed the [[Hells Pass Hospital]] backup generator by using himself to connect two wires (resulting in electrocution), and he once smashed a shell with his head to release [[Moses]] from captivity inside the shell (smashing his head in too). Arguably the most touching of these deaths was in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', when he wishes for everything to be back to normal despite that he would knowingly go to hell in the process (he instead almost immediately ascended to Heaven, where he was gifted with a Halo, wings, and thirty or so busty, naked women. Apparently one saving the earth from eternal damnation causes God to overlook one not being a Mormon). His ascension also marked the first, and to date only time his entire face has been seen (in other instances he has some form of cover, such as a baseball cap or a snorkel mask) and the first time his voice could be heard clearly. ""[[Super Best Friends]]"" depicts Kenny as a willing martyr for a cult he has recently joined. In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", Kenny used the Golden PSP to defeat Satan's army.

The most shining example of his heroism, however, is his role as [[Mysterion]], a hero who defends the town from evil forces including [[Butters Stotch|Professor Chaos]] and [[Eric Cartman|the Coon]]. First appearing in ""[[The Coon]]"" with an unclear identity and returning in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"" Mysterion is shown to be a resourceful and intelligent hero with a strong sense of morals and justice - however his identity remained unknown until ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" during which Mysterion opens the episode with a monologue mentioning having a power - Mysterion is later revealed to have been Kenny the entire time, and his super ower bishis inability to die. It is at this point that Kenny begins taking upon the role of the hero; though his loyal characteristics and sense of morality are strong, his increasing frustration becomes apparent when he confronts his friends for not remembering his many deaths.

He spends most of ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"" trying to come to terms with his powers, and at the end he begs Cthulhu to bring back the other Coon Friends making the ultimate sacrifice by offering himself up, noting ""only an immortal can kill another immortal"", meaning if Cthulhu killed Mysterion, he would not be reborn.

In ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", Kenny returns as Mysterion to protect his sister, [[Karen McCormick|Karen]]. He defended her against a school bully and got his foster parents arrested before they were able to hose [[Karen McCormick|his sister]] down with Doctor Pepper.

When the boys decide to attack the robbers in ""[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]"", Kenny is the one who gives instructions to Kyle, Stan, and Cartman on how to ambush the intruders.

It is implied in ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"" that Kenny speaks fluent Romanian and a bit of Spanish in ""[[W.T.F.]]"".

Kenny is the most recognizable in South Park as being very knowledgeable with the subject of sex. Indeed, he is depicted as being obsessive with the female body. In ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"" Kenny's memories include his father asking him if he had been looking at his porn magazines and his father holding up a picture of a scantily clad woman with the crotch cut out. In ""[[Major Boobage]]"", the majority of the episode Kenny is trying to see the busty cowgirl lady by getting high. In other episodes, you can see in Kenny's room a poster of a lady in a bikini. In ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"" he is seen with porno magazines in his schoolbag. In ""[[The Ring]]"", he tries to get his [[Tammy Warner|girlfriend]] to give him a BJ by taking her to a Jonas concert,since rumor had it she gave someone else a BJ after becoming aroused by the Jonas brothers.

Kenny is shown to be one of the more intelligent characters later on in the series; along with Kyle, Stan, Jimmy, and Tolkien. Kenny also seems to be good at Origami when you usually see him in his desk messing around with paper.

Kenny is shown to be the best with weaponry in the group. Although Cartman uses them more he is unskilled with them. In ""[[Volcano]]"", he blows up the fish with a grenade in the lake and shoots a ram down with a shotgun. He also shows skill with a shuriken and hits right on target in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"". Kenny is shown in ""[[Towelie]]"" to be able to do a backflip when they sneak into the ""military base"", while climbing the fence. He was able to obtain a sniper rifle in ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"", but it got confiscated by a security guard. In that episod,e he managed to jump onto a speeding NASCAR (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) race car. As Mysterion, Kenny takes the gun from Captain Hindsight and uses it effectively against himself twice, loading it in the process, showing knowledge of that weapon. In ""[[Major Boobage]]"" Kenny is able to perfectly throw a spear through a monster's throat (but it could be something else since he was cheesing). He seems to know a lot about explosives as he was about to disable Timmy's wheelchair bomb but he dies and he and Cartman set a bomb to blow up the ""future telling device,"" which causes a massive explosion.

Kenny dressed up as a pregnant underage girl to get morning-after abortion pills (though the only thing he wore was a long, blond wig) in ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"". He dressed up and posed as Michael Jackson's son in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"" as [[Blanket Jackson]]. He also acted in ""[[W.T.F.]]"" as a wrestler. He was also part of the [[South Park Elementary]] school Christmas play in ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"".

In ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"", Kenny demonstrates his ability to stay perfectly balanced by doing a hand - stand for several minutes, with the constriction of his clothing on him, never falling or swaying.

In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"" he teaches Stan and Kyle how to download music free of charge from the Internet. He also helped along in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"". In the ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", Kenny was seen playing ''Call of Duty: World at War'' with all of the other children. He also had a laptop from the One Laptop per Child program in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"".

Kenny is shown to have a large mastery of strategic video gaming in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", reaching Level 60 in the Game ""[[Heaven]] vs. [[Hell]]"", and was known by the angels as the Heaven's equivalent of Keanu Reeves (Neo from the ''Matrix'' trilogy or John Constantine from the film ''Constantine''). In ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"" he is a human hunter in the game ''World of Warcraft'' (a race/class combination not actually possible in the game until the release of the ''Cataclysm ''expansion four years after the episode). In ""[[Towelie]]"", he plays the 2001 Okama Gamesphere with the other boys until his death, at which time Towelie takes his place. In the ""[[Chinpokomon]]"" episode, he suffers a non-fatal seizure while playing a game about bombing Pearl Harbor. Also in ""[[Whale Whores]]"" he plays the drums in ''Rock Band'', playing the song ""Poker Face"" by Lady Gaga, with Kyle on the guitar and Cartman on the vocals. Also, in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"" he is playing EA Sports ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11]]'' on the Xbox 360 with Cartman and appears to be winning.

Kenny appears to be very musically talented. After taking opera voice lessons in ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"", Kenny is shown to be very good at singing. He uses this talent to travel to Romania where he performs for money. He is also a good drummer as seen in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"" and ""[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]"" (also playing drums on Rock Band in ""[[Whale Whores]]"") and plays violin as seen in ""[[Summer Sucks]]"". He can also sing and dance at the same time, extremely evident in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"", ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"" and ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"". Also in ""[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]"", it is shown that he can play the flute as well. He, along with the rest of the fourth grade (third grade at the time), is shown to have (questionable) talent with the recorder as seen in ""[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]"". In a pan flute band he can play the Zampona and he is seen with a trumpet at the end when they think of starting a salsa band.

He played football in the Season One episode, ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"", was part of the dodgeball team in the Season Two episode, ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"", and played Center Field on the baseball team in the Season Nine episode, ""[[The Losing Edge]]"". In ""[[The Losing Edge]]"" and ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"", the number on the back of his shirt is the number 13, a joke on how Kenny is unlucky due to being in poverty and dying all the time. In ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"", his number is 69, a reference to his perverted sense of humor. Kenny can also play tetherball, but ended up getting strangled by it in ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"". In ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"" Kenny is shown to love NASCAR. In ""[[Grey Dawn]]"" he was seen playing street hockey with the rest of the boys. He has also played basketball with Cartman, Stan, and Kyle.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Kenny has become a scientist, humanitarian, philanthropist, and a Nobel laureate, having being granted the ""Dr."" title. He retains his Nobel prize in the alternate timeline seen at the end of ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', albeit through unorthodox means (for combining dark matter and breast implants).

Out of all the boys, Kenny has the highest voice pitch (aside from when acting as Mysterion). His speech is muffled, so that it is often difficult to hear what he says, although closed captions sometimes verify his lines. In later episodes, his lines have become somewhat more intelligible. An example of this is in ""[[Chinpokomon]]"", where he appears to say ""Fuck you"" to Cartman after he attempted to trade another Chinpokomon for Kenny's Penguin. He says the same thing to Kyle in ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"" upon being told he cannot just have mints (which are really antacid tablets) for dinner, although the interpretation of what he said was helped by the fact he was flipping Kyle off at the time.

His unique muffled voice is accomplished by his voice actor [[Matt Stone]], speaking into his cupped hand. He speaks clearly and without his hood in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", ""[[Lice Capades]]"", and ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" with proper, unmuffled lines. In ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", when he is seen in his baseball uniform, he is heard cheering when the team wins at the beginning of the episode. In ""[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]"", when he is literally pulled out of his parka in an attempt to have one of his baby teeth pulled out, he lands completely nude in front of Cartman and is heard groaning. Kenny is shown without his hood in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", ""[[Lice Capades]]"", ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", ""[[Margaritaville]]"", ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', ""[[The Coon]]"" ""[[W.T.F.]]"", ""[[Pee]]"", ""[[Sexual Healing]]"", ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"" , ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"" ""[[Sarcastaball]]"", ""[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]"" and ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"". In the film, Kenny's voice unhooded is performed by Mike Judge, creator of ""Beavis and Butt-head"" and ""King of the Hill"". In ""[[The Jeffersons]]"" and ""[[Lice Capades]]"", Kenny's unmuffled voice was performed by Eric Stough, a former Director of Animation at South Park Studios and a now-producer of the show, making it sound more high-pitched than it did in the movie in the former, and in the latter deeper. When dressed as Iron Man in ""[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]"", Kenny is voiced by Matt Stone who can be clearly heard but is slightly masked by a voice changer. He sounds like Kyle but in a higher voice. In the original Christmas short, his mouth is visible and he has an unmuffled line (""Yeah!"") which sounds slightly nasally (a bit like Craig or Clyde).

Despite that his mouth is rarely shown and covered by his orange parka, he vomits in ""[[Major Boobage]]"" and his mouth is clearly seen, though it disappears when he finishes vomiting. In ""[[Pinkeye]]"", when Kenny (as a zombie) attacks a lady giving the boys candy, you can see his mouth as he starts to eat her. Also in ""[[Fat Camp]]"", when Kenny is paid to eat all kinds of disgusting things for money, you can clearly see his mouth as he eats a dissected Manatee spleen in class, and dog poo, and his own vomit, even though lots of kids get disgusted.

He was revealed to be Mysterion, so in ""[[The Coon]]"", ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", you can hear his voice clearly, though he disguises it with a deep tone. In one scene in ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", Kenny's voice is heard unmuffled, provided by Eric Stough as listed in the end credits, and it sounds closer to ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' than the previous episodes. In ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"" when Mysterion confronts Cartman, his voice wavers, although it is debatable whether he had dropped the disguise or has simply let his guard down partially due to emotional impact is unknown. Kenny has the unusual ability to modify his normally high-pitched voice to a very deep one as Mysterion.

In the earlier seasons, he tended to take a backseat to the [[Stan Marsh|other]] [[Eric Cartman|three]] [[Kyle Broflovski|boys]], given rather limited dialogue as opposed to them. A majority of his roles involved showing off his sexual knowledge, or being killed as a running gag of every episode, the latter resulting in Stan exclaiming ""Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"" followed by Kyle adding ""You bastards!""

He does, however, make a major plot contribution near the end of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', where [[Satan]] is willing to grant him one wish after he made him realize that [[Saddam Hussein]] was a bad lover; Kenny wishes for everything to go back to normal and sacrificially risks returning to Hell in the process. Afterwards, all the Canadians are resurrected and the dark battlefield transitions into a grassy and bright atmosphere thanks to him. Because of his heroic sacrifice, he is admitted into Heaven as he initially desired, and gives everyone a happy end.

Afterwards, he was given more central episodes around him where he spoke more lines of dialog, for example: ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", ""[[Major Boobage]]"", ""[[The Ring]]"", ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"", ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", and ""[[The Poor Kid]]"".

Kenny is also noted for having the most absences out of the boys. He was also appeared in a very limited capacity in [[Season Twenty]], receiving only one line total in ""[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]"".

Kenny wears an orange parka, orange pants and brown gloves. Almost all of the time, Kenny has his hood on so that only his eyes are seen. Underneath his hood, he has messy blond hair, which looks somewhat similar to that of [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]]'s, another character on the show. On occasion, usually when he is scared or crying, he will pull the strings on his hood to make it tighten, although he did this once after Cartman had farted in an unventilated space on an airplane (""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]""). In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", Kenny has a parka that is light purple with a part of his hair coming out of the hood, black pants, and brown boots with a black stripe down them. Later in the episode, he buys another parka that is pink and fluffy.

He is shown at times to have almost nothing on underneath his parka, as seen in ""[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]"", [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|the film]], ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", and ""[[Lice Capades]]"", though mostly he does have a white T-shirt on. Kenny is shown to have blue eyes in ""[[Starvin' Marvin]]"", in which a mutant turkey pulls out his eye and in a close-up, a blue iris is momentarily visible. In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", in anime style Kenny's eyes shows his iris which are blue. However, in an early draft for ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Kenny is described as having hazel eyes. In the film and ""[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]"", it is shown that Kenny sleeps in his underwear, making him the only one of the boys who does so (Kyle, Cartman, and Stan all wear pajamas, and [[Tweek Tweak]] rarely sleeps and thus has no pajamas, except in ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]""). However, in other episodes, he is shown sleeping in his parka. It would seem that his parka was made from pieces of his bedroom curtains, because in ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"", when we see Kenny practicing opera singing, we see his curtains in the background. They are of orange material, and a huge part of one is missing.

After ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', he can be seen unhooded in several episodes, although, in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", when Stan finds Kenny drowned in a pool, he has a bald fade due to every kid having shaved their heads earlier in the episode, making him indistinguishable from the others (minus Cartman). In ""[[Margaritaville]]"", when the boys are playing with squirrels, Kenny is shown wearing part of his ""toga"" (a bedcloth) over his face, mimicking how his parka covers his face. More parts of his face—and his hair—are still visible, such as in ""[[W.T.F.]]"", when he is in his wrestling outfit, he wears headgear that covers most of his face; in the same episode, when playing his wrestling alter-ego [[El Pollo Loco]] (a parody of Mexican wrestler Rey Mysterio), he wears a mask that also covers most of his face. In ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", he wears a baseball cap that covers up a little of his right eye and forehead (as well as a jersey with the number 13). In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"" Kenny is also seen without his hood, and unlike other times his face is clearly shown in a side view. In ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"", Kenny is in his bathing suit with his face clearly shown.

In the original Christmas short, he looks generally the same, but he wears green mittens and has a red scarf. His mouth is visible and his voice is intelligible (it sounds a little like [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]'s or [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s). He only has one line, though.

A photo-realistic version of Kenny's appearance was produced as a police artist sketch for the episode ""[[Free Willzyx]]"", showing his nose.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he has grown a full beard, and has gained much weight. He wears an orange t-shirt with beer bottle patterns, brown shorts, and green slippers with white socks. He also wears a light brown hat with a yellow badge bearing the words ""Be Cool!"" and a pair of black tinted glasses, maintaining a form of cover.

[[File:N8989836574 1309.jpg|thumb|Kenny On Facebook]]
Kenny is the most sexually knowledgeable and experienced of the group. In earlier episodes, when an unknown term is introduced to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman, Kenny will be called upon by his friends to clarify, although Kenny sometimes does not know the meaning of the term himself. His muffled responses are often met with laughter or further confusion. Kenny does seem to act differently without his parka on.

In ""[[The Ring]]"", upon finding out that his girlfriend [[Tammy Warner]] gave another boy a ""B.J."" (oral sex) in a T.G.I. Friday's parking lot, he pursued that wish throughout the episode and eventually got his wish, though he subsequently died of syphilis. In ""[[Fat Camp]]"", he gave [[Howard Stern]] a ""hummer"" (also oral sex) for ten bucks while promoting his [[Krazy Kenny Show]].

His sexual knowledge may be gleaned from his parents, or from the pornography which Kenny possesses in ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"". He often performs disgusting acts for money, such as dissecting a Manatee and eating its spleen, then regurgitating it and eating it again (""[[Fat Camp]]""). He also drinks from Jimbo's gas tank in ""[[Volcano]]"". In ""[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]"" he creates a haiku:

''When you rub your dick''Kenny has fought on a few occasions and is most likely the most physically active out of all the boys. He holds the ability to perform his ""Spin Blossom Nut Squash"" on command, as seen in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"". He is also able to throw shurikens correctly, as demonstrated by hitting Butters directly in the eye with one in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"". He occasionally gets into physical confrontations with Cartman due to Cartman's abusive nature (especially in early seasons). While Cartman overpowered him by sitting on him and farting in ""[[Clubhouses]]"", Kenny was able to easily beat him when he tried to stop Stan and Kyle from entering the Wall-Mart with a dagger. It is also shown in many other episodes he has a rather good accuracy with lon- range objects. Disregarding the deleted ending to [[The Coon]], he is easily able to hold off Butters and Dougie singlehandedly, although in both his encounter with Cartman and his encounter with Professor Chaos, his main strategy seemed to consist of simply hitting his opponent until they gave up. When the deleted ending is taken into account, this is Kyle's fighting strategy. It is also worthy to note that both Cartman and Butters have repeatedly been shown to be physically weak. He is shown to have great climbing skilsl in that episode, which is again displayed in ""[[1%]]"". In ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", Kenny, as [[Mysterion]], effortlessly beat up a bully who was picking on his sister, [[Karen McCormick|Karen]]; firs,t he kicks her with enough force to send her into the air, does a spinning kick into her head, then punches her in the head, causing her to fall on the ground.

Kenny is unable to die. In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", he remarks on how many times he has died, but instead of dying permanently, he ends up waking up in his bed, alive. He is troubled by the fact that no one remembers his deaths. He views his ""power"" as a curse. However, Cartman once stated that he dies all the time in ""[[Cartmanland]]"", which indicates that Cartman is the only one to remember Kenny's deaths, but, presumably due to his selfish nature, refuses to acknowledge them unless it would somehow benefit him. Also, in ""[[Fourth Grade]]"", Stan remarks ""Who didn't see that coming?"", indicating that he also knows.

Stuart McCormick is Kenny's alcoholic father. He is usually seen hanging out with the other men in South Park and sometimes arguing, or physically fighting, with his wife. Stuart's alcoholism is probably why the McCormick family is so far into poverty. Kenny is shown to not care when Stuart and Kevin are fighting, merely watching television with a bored look.

Carol McCormick is Kenny's mother. In ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", it is shown that after Kenny dies, his soul returns to her, takes to another body and is reborn. Similarly, in the last episode of the Mysterion Trilogy, Kenny is literally reborn, however, this time it is left open that Kenny's immortality is due to his parents worshiping [[Cthulhu]]. She says in ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", ""We never should have gone to those stupid cult meetings."", meaning she is probably tired of having to give birth to Kenny over and over again.

Kevin McCormick is Kenny's older brother. He is very untidy in appearance. He does not have many speaking lines, but when he does speak, he seems to repeat much of what he says. His voice sounds similar to those of Terrance Mephesto, Bill, and Fosse, but he must get the accent from his mom. He is seen with a few band aids on his face. Kenny is shown to not care when Kevin and Stuart are fighting, merely watching television with a bored look. Kevin is quite different from Kenny, since Kevin always gets into arguments with his family, while Kenny seems to ignore everything that is happening around him. Kenny and Kevin do not seem to talk to each other much.

Karen McCormick is Kenny's reclusive younger sister. She first appeared in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", when she and the rest of the McCormicks visited Kenny in the hospital. Kenny is shown to care a lot for his little sister, even going so far as to dress up as his alter ego [[Mysterion]] to comfort her and show her that she is never alone, as well as beating up [[Jessica Pinkerton]] for attempting to bully Karen. In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"" he immediately follows Karen out of the room to comfort her when their dad yells at her, and uses the money he earned at [[City Wok]] to buy her a new doll.

''See ""[[Fat Camp]]"" for details''

Kenny's grandfather did not have any speaking lines but he appeared in ""[[Fat Camp]]"" when Kenny, as a stunt on the 'Krazy Kenny Show', gave him a full-body massage on live television. He has never been mentioned or appeared on any other episode. It is unknown if this was his paternal or maternal grandfather.

Kenny is a friendly person in general, often seen interacting with other boys in background scenes. He is one of the leaders of the male student population, along with the rest of [[The Boys|the boys]]. Despite his obsession with sex, he seems to have a decent relationship with girls. He was shown to be successful in maintaining a serious relationship with [[Kelly (""Rainforest Schmainforest"")|two]] [[Tammy Warner|girls]] in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"" as well as ""[[The Ring]]"".

Even though Kenny usually rivals against Craig and his friends along with Stan, Kyle and Cartman, they all seem to still get along with him for the most part when the two groups are not in disagreement. They can all been seen playing and working together in episodes like ""[[Free Willzyx]]"" and ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"". Craig and Kenny chose to be partners in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"". Craig even allowed Kenny to join him in making his ""Animals Close-Up With a Wide-Angle Lens"" video when Cartman would not let Kenny join their report team in ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"". This is explained by the fact that Kenny is hooded all the time - being a news reporter, he would have had to show his face and have a really nice hairstyle. The given reason, though, is that Cartman thinks Kenny does not watch the news because he is poor. However, in episodes like ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"", Kenny has shown da islike for Craig by saying that he does not like him, though it could have merely been out of frustration that Craig refused hto elp them again.

In ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"", Rob Schneider was possessed by Kenny, after eating a meat loaf that Kenny's soul was trapped inside. Then, during a commercial for a Rob Schneider movie coming out, he was seen trying to kiss Milly which may conclude that Kenny had a crush on her. Also in ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", Kenny chose Milly to rub and hug him for their music video.

Cartman generally seems to tolerate Kenny, although he regards him as being lesser than him because he is poor, and can even at times be seen to treat Kenny as sort of a general laborer/servant, he is also very abusive, both physically and verbally. Cartman does appear to consider Kenny as his best friend out of the other three boys, although he is not above exaggerating the depth of their friendship in order to achieve or obtain something he wants, usually after Kenny dies or is incapacitated, such as in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"". In the same episode, Kenny described his general attitude toward his friendship with Cartman as his feeling sorry for him, because everyone else hates him. However, it is also shown that the two share a ""best friends forever"" necklace (hence the title of the episode). However it is implied that Cartman managed to sneak the necklace onto Kenny's neck in order to prove to everyone that he and Kenny were indeed best friends. It is seen that some times when something beneficial happens to the town, Cartman and Kenny are seen hugging, such as in ""[[Red Man's Greed]]"" and ""[[The F Word]]"". In ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", Kenny agrees with Cartman's assessment that the two are best friends, as Kyle and Stan are. However, this is refuted in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", in which Kenny had written in his will that Stan and Kyle were his best friends and he never really liked Eric Cartman. All things considered, their ""best"" friendship seems to end as of ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"".

Kenny will go along with Cartman if he talks about something he agrees on, such as the time he giggled uncontrollably when Cartman farted in Kyle's face in ""[[Cancelled]]"", or Kyle and Stan if he gets really annoyed by Cartman's attitude. Although muffled, Kenny has often called Cartman by his first name ""Eric"", such as in ""[[Probably]]"", when he calls Cartman on the phone from Mexico and later when Jesus sends Cartman to Mexico as punishment. On occasion, he is known to punch Cartman when Cartman rips on him for being poor, and Cartman has been shown beating up Kenny when Kenny refuses to go along with his ideas, particularly in the early seasons. In fact, in ""[[Cartmanland]]"", Kenny was invited to go to Cartman's theme park, when Kyle and Stan could not come.

Cartman has shown to get angry and defensive after Kenny has died, while Stan and Kyle take it like it was nothing and have sometimes used it to get what they want (such as asking for ice cream with butterscotch in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]""). He also seemed to be aware of Kenny dying in ""[[Cartmanland]]"", but in ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" Kenny said nobody noticed.

Kenny has also been known to detest or mock Cartman on occasion, such as when Cartman degraded NASCAR fans by crashing a stolen car into a lake in [[Poor and Stupid]] - Kenny stormed down to Cartman's house to yell at him (nearly destroying the door in the process) - he was even prepared to kill Cartman in defense of NASCAR's reputation. He also laughed when Kyle and Stan abandoned Cartman for cheating at a war game when he yelled ""I can play with myself all day!"" in ""[[Clubhouses]]"". In ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"", Kenny got mad at Cartman again when he started claiming he hated Kenny. He then tried to distract Cartman by pretending to be a new species of antelope (so that the Jakovasaurs could be smuggled to France), but instead got mauled by a bear.

It should be noted that although his voice is muffled, Kenny can be heard using Cartman's first name, ""Eric"", on occasion (such as in ""[[Probably]]""), making him the only one out of Cartman's primary three friends to do so. However, in ""[[Chickenlover]]"" and more recent episodes, Kenny called Cartman by his surname when Cartman was at his house.

It should also be noted that Kenny's alternate identity, Mysterion, and Eric's, the Coon, appear to have a rivalry. This can be seen in ""[[The Coon]]"", ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"". In particular, Mysterion kept the group name ""[[Coon and Friends]]"" after Cartman was kicked out because it ""pissed Cartman off beyond belief"", and he found it ""extremely funny"".

Cartman is the only character to be aware of Kenny's constant dying, saying ""He dies all the time!"" in ""[[Cartmanland]]"". In ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"" he told a story while they were stranded on the bus about Kenny dying before he was killed by a giant black monster. Kyle points out that Kenny dying before would have been impossible because ""he can't die twice"". This would mean he is immune to the psychic effect that Kenny's deaths have on others. By extension, this may mean Cartman has immunity to mind control or other psychological effects.

While not shown in as much detail as Kyle and Cartman's newfound friendship, with the boys ending their friendship with a pessimistic Stan in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", he also seems to be developing a better one with Cartman.

A picture of Kenny and Cartman at Casa Bonita is seen ""[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]"" which implies they have a close friendship.

Kenny does not take part in smashing Cartman's electronics in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"".

Although Kenny and Stan do not seem to share the same bond that Stan and Kyle do, Stan does seem to think of Kenny as a close friend. In ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", out of the 3 boys, Stan has the hardest time dealing with Kenny dying, and cannot even bear to see him in the hospital. When Stan finally realizes that Kenny passed on ""for good"", he feels like he was Kenny's worst friend (until they hear about Cartman's selfishness). The two boys often hang out with one another when Cartman and Kyle get into their arguments and Stan and Kenny do not want to listen to it, such as in ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"". In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", Stan and Kyle fight against Cartman to not have Kenny's feeding tube removed to save Kenny's life.

However, in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"", when all hope seems lost to save Kyle and Stan breaks down crying in front of Kenny because of Kyle's impending death, he does not seem to care or even acknowledge the fact that Kenny dies all the time. This angers Kenny and makes him leave Stan to go home after using Cartman's catchphrase ""Screw you guys I'm going home!"" - which in turn causes his death by walking under a falling piano, and even then Stan still fails to notice or care.

During the first five seasons, Stan would merely say, [[""Oh my God, they killed Kenny!""]], after one of Kenny's classic deaths, and then he would not acknowledge him again after that.

Like Cartman and Kyle, Kenny is at first only annoyed with Stan in [[You're Getting Old]], with his constant complaining and buzzkilling. Unfortunately, when Stan gets worse and becomes unbearable to be with, he first ditches him and then, along with Cartman and Kyle, breaks off their friendship until the conflict is resolved in [[Ass Burgers]].
Kenny and Kyle's relationship does not seem to be as strong as it is with the other boys. Kyle does not seem to really even notice Kenny a lot of the time. There is even a time in ""[[Chickenpox]]"" when Kyle says that Kenny is not his friend (this could be to get out of going to his house).

Though along with Stan, Kyle's shown his definite concern for Kenny and does view him as a very close friend, they rarely interact one-on-one. In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", Kenny gives all of his belongings (excluding his PSP) to Stan and Kyle, and Stan and Kyle fight very hard to save their friend from Cartman and his supporters. He also invites Kenny to his birthday party in ""[[Casa Bonita]]"". Kenny often sides with Kyle on many issues, even over Cartman, like in ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", where Kenny supports Kyle's mascot instead of Cartman's. Also in ""[[Jewbilee]]"" Kyle asked Kenny to come to Jew Scouts so that it would be fun.

Despite the neglect, Kenny has been shown to bear feelings of friendship towards Kyle, even to the point of trying to convince him of his own power as Mysterion to the point of shooting himself in front of him and Stan, much to their surprise and his later dismay when neither of them remember. Kenny also thinks Kyle is the smartest kid in his class, asking him for help in ""[[The Coon]]"" for that reason.

In the first five seasons and sporadically afterward, whenever Kenny dies, Kyle follows with ""You bastards!"" after Stan yells, ""Oh my God, they killed Kenny!""
After the episode, ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", and after Kenny's comeback in the [[Season Six]] finale "" [[Red Sleigh Down]]"", he seems to have less of a major role until Season Eleven, sharing with Butters. The episode ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", where Butters drew a picture of him and Kenny (as best friends) together in an airplane in which Kyle delivered to Kenny at the hospital, indicates that Butters sees Kenny as a really close friend. Kenny played the ""good cop"" and comforted Butters in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", and Butters tried to help Kenny during ""[[Major Boobage]]"". The two were also playing together in a sandbox in ""[[Eek, A Penis!]]"". Butters took Kenny's place when Kenny died, possibly hinting that Butters deeply missed Kenny (instead of simply wanting to hang out with the other boys). In ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", Kenny and Butters can be seen hugging when Stan and Kyle break 1,000,000 points on Guitar Hero, and they hi-five each other after Willzyx is returned to the ocean in ""[[Free Willzyx]]"". Also, in ""[[The Ring]]"", Butters seemed quite alarmed when he discovered Kenny had a new ""whore"" girlfriend. Kenny can also be seen shaking Butters' hand after kissing [[Sally Darson]] in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"". In ""[[Going Native]]"" Butters considers Kenny his only true friend and allows him to go to [[Hawaii]] with him, against his initial protest.

Kenny briefly had a girlfriend named Kelly in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"" (she was first to admit her feelings for him) who came to his aid during one of his famous ""death"" scenes. In the next episode, ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", it is revealed that he spends a lot of time at a new girlfriend's house but the viewer never sees her. Because Kenny had started dating Kelly in the previous episode, it is safe to assume that they are one and the same. Kelly has not been heard of since, although she was seen at the dance in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"", possibly having arranged to meet up with Kenny, but not being able to as he is dead at that point. If you look closely, however, you can actually see parts of Kenny's parka with Kelly at the dance.

In ""[[The Ring]]"", Kenny gets a new girlfriend, a fifth grader named Tammy Warner. She happens to be the only person in the school poorer than Kenny's family. Classmates at school call her a slut because she gave a boy named Dave Darskey a B.J. (blow job) in the parking lot of a T.G.I. Friday's. Kenny later finds out that she did this because she got worked up watching the Jonas Brothers on television. This prompts Kenny to go and buy her tickets to a Jonas Brothers concert, hoping that it becomes his way into her heart, as well as her body. After the concert, Tammy and several other girls are called backstage where they are given a purity ring by the Jonas Brothers themselves, which stops them from doing anything ""naughty"". As Kenny is given a purity ring by Tammy, he is very upset at this, as well as completely bored. Eventually, due to boredom, they take off the purity rings and Tammy gives Kenny a B.J. Unfortunately, the next day, Kenny ends up contracting syphilis and thus dies; in the final minutes of the episode, his funeral is held, and the Vicar attending the funeral gives a speech about the dangers of syphilis: ''""And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection.""''

Kenny appears as one of the main characters; along with [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. Kenny is one of the playable characters.

Kenny appears as [[Princess Kenny]], the same role he filled in the [[Black Friday]] arc, this time remaining on Cartman's side for most of the game. However, he betrays both Cartman and Kyle, since he was born a half-orc, a species that was destroyed by humans and elves. The player must then defeat him as a regular character, and a nazi zombie, before they must use the power of farting to fully defeat him, and the nazi zombies.

Kyle Broflovski,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kyle_Broflovski,,"is one of ''[[South Park]]''<nowiki/>'s main characters, along with [[Stan Marsh]], [[Eric Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick]]. Based on co-creator [[Matt Stone]], Kyle is a member of the only Jewish family in South Park. He is often noted for this, as well as his intelligence.

Upon arrival, Ike is used as a table stand at a bar there.
*'''False Imprisonment:''' In ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", following [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy's]] advice, he ties [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] to a tree, using him as bait to get the Visitors to return to Earth and present an opportunity to rescue Ike. In ""Spontaneous Combustion"", he and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], as part of a passion play at the [[South Park Church|latter's church]], tie Cartman to a cross and place him on top of the nearby hill. Instead of untying him, though, they leave him there, thinking he will die and resurrect, helping to solve [[Gerald Broflovski|his father's]] impotence somehow.

*'''Academic Fraud:''' In ""Gnomes"", Kyle and his study group ([[The Boys|his friends]] and [[Tweek]]) use the essay Tweek's dad wrote for them. This is academic fraud, because they are claiming they created a piece of academic work that they did not write.
*'''Burglary:''' In ""[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]"", he breaks into [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto's]] [[South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch|laboratory]] and frees [[Larry (""Prehistoric Ice Man"")|Larry]].

*'''Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction/Manslaughter:''' In ""[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]"", in an effort to show up the New York kids at Yoko Ono's recorder concert, he and his friends alter their song sheets to contain the brown note, so when the New York kids play their music, they will lose bowel control, soiling their pants and humiliating them. However, the organizers discover the revized sheet, believing that it is for the entire performance, resulting in the fake sheet music being distributed to every single child at the concert. As a result, the brown note - backed by the lungs of over four million American third-graders - is heard throughout the world, with disastrous consequences and, [[Kenny McCormick|in at least one case]], loss of life.

*'''Attempted Murder:''' In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", after being bullied for not conforming to the metrosexual fad, he decides, along with [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] and [[Mr. Slave]], to travel to New York City and murder the hosts of ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]] ''for popularizing the fad. Their plans are thwarted when Mr. Slave severely injures himself trying to crash through a glass window. Despite this, the hosts do not press charges against them, so the police do not prosecute the three.
*'''Murder:''' In ""[[Sexual Healing]]"", he and Butters are ordered by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] to shoot at a ""[[Wizard Alien|wizard alien]]"" who, unbeknown to them, is a soldier dressed up in an alien costume. However, this does not really count as a crime as they were forced by the authorities to kill the soldier and were tricked into thinking he was an alien.
*'''Illegally Downloading Music:''' In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", he, Stan, and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] try to find inspiration for their band [[Moop]] and download various songs off of the internet illegally.

Kyle is of the [[Jews|Jewish]] faith, but this detail is not officially revealed until ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"", despite having been mentioned briefly in the second ''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]'' short, and in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"". It was also mentioned in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"". Cartman regularly makes derogatory remarks about the Jewish people, often directly in Kyle's presence specifically to aggravate him.

Kyle appears to have mixed feelings toward Judaism, and there is conflicting evidence as to the religiousness of his family - for example, while they dress similarly to many religious Jews (Gerald, for example, always wears a yarmulke), they apparently do not keep the Sabbath or follow very strict sexual lives (Sheila Stone, mother of [[Matt Stone]], was herself a secular Sephardic Jew). Kyle's apparent indifference to religion may be part of his effort to fit in with his friends, who are mostly Roman Catholic. Kyle is more often defensive than proud of his faith, and though he regularly attends such functions as ""Jew Scouts"", he often has a poor grasp of the history, traditions and rituals of his religion. He is very naive, though he is seen to know more in later seasons. This could be the fault of his parents, who, in a misguided attempt to shelter their son, generally do not discuss with him the finer points of their religion. For example:

According to Mr. Garrison, Kyle is a ""smart"" and ""A+"" student. Also Kyle, along with the other boys, is portrayed as having multiple useful and trivial talents. However, at very rare times, like most of the children, he is also portrayed as being ignorant.

In ""[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]"", Kyle begins to question reality once he discovers the Tooth Fairy is not real. He reads what seems to be every book on psychology, reality, and science ever written. This also leads him to question whether or not he truly exists. In the end of the episode, Kyle seems to fade from existence before going into a God-like state for a while; distorting reality and making a giant squirrel-chicken hybrid appear. In the end, he returns to normal, shrugging off the experience. Subsequently, towards the end of ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"" Kyle screams at [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the other ""psychic"" detectives, causing the lights to go out and the shelves behind his hospital bed to shake and their contents to fall.

Kyle is often seen playing video games with Stan, Kenny and Cartman, and owns an Xbox. In ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", the boys compliment Kyle and Stan's skill on Guitar Hero 123, and later in the episode, they pass the million point mark together in co-op mode - a feat that was thought to be practically impossible. In ""[[Whale Whores]]"", Kyle is shown playing guitar or bass in Rock Band for the song [[Poker Face]].

Kyle has played a numerous amount of sports including Basketball, Football, Baseball, Soccer, Hockey, and Dodgeball. He is very talented athletically. Kyle is known to be the best basketball player at South Park Elementary, one of two sports at which Stan is not the best (the other being Dodgeball, at which Pip is considered the best). However, in ""[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]"", he goes to the all-state game tryouts and is rejected not because of his skills, but because of the fact that he is short and Jewish (rather than tall and black). Oddly, Kyle was not in the basketball team in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", though this was probably to avoid Kyle being active in the fad. Kyle has stated that he wants to play in the Denver Nuggets someday. On the football team however, he is very talented. He made a touchdown, which remarked his skills. He played as a Guard in Basketball, a Wide Receiver in Football, and Second Base in Baseball.

In ""[[Hooked on Monkey Phonics]]"" Kyle plays the guitar to serenade home-schooled Rebecca, who responds by throwing him money. He also performs with the boy band [[Fingerbang]] in ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"". And accompanied Stan in their attempt at reaching one million points in co-op mode on Guitar Hero, in ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"". And is seen performing a musical number in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"". He also played bass in the boys' band Moop. He does not appear to have much sense of rhythm in terms of dancing however, as in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]""; he kept messing up every time the group performed (although in 'Elementary School Musical' this was contradicted by the fact the main boys performed a long and complicated dance routine perfectly). Kyle also shouts after [[Robert Smith]] in ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"" that ""Disintegration is the best album ever!""

Kyle is shown to have relatively strong computer skills, as shown in ""[[The Snuke]]"" wherein he uses various public resources to thwart a terrorist threat from a Soviet-style militant. In the film, he initiates research on the clitoris and accidentally stumbling on pornography featuring [[Liane Cartman]]. When arrested by the Japanese government for ecoterrorism in ""[[Whale Whores]]"" Stan enlists the help of Kyle (who remained in South Park) to manipulate an image showing a dolphin and whale in the Enola Gay to a cow and chicken. Kyle is also shown to be active on social media websites such as Facebook and using popular electronic devices such as Apple's iPad in ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"". During the events of ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", he solved the mystery of who was behind the [[Eavesdropper]] website scandal by tracking the IP address within the [[South Park Elementary|school]]. He is considered to have the best technological skills out of his entire class.

Kyle occasionally phrases what he says in a somewhat poetic way when he speaks philosophically, questioning reality and why things are as they are. In ""[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]"" Mr. Garrison begins to explain haiku's (a form of poetry) to the class, but stops on noticing Cartman was not in the classroom. Kyle shortly after comes up with three haiku's on the spot which are all used to insult Cartman. Also, in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"" Kyle is informed that Cartman had three extra tickets on the 28th row at the Raging Pussies concert, but Kyle's mom tells him he cannot go to see it unless he has done all his chores and brought democracy to Cuba (assuming it to be an impossible task). This prompts Kyle to write a letter to Fidel Castro, who is actually convinced to bring democracy to Cuba after reading Kyle's innocent, persuasive rhymes, lyrics, and words. Kyle also seems to take a leading role in writing the book ''[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]'' with the other boys in ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"".

In ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", Kyle seems to speak pig-Latin extremely well, even losing [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] in conversation. He can also speak and understand [[Marklar]] well.

:''See: [[Human Kite]]''

Kyle becomes sick more often than any of the other [[The Boys|boys]], despite [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] dying repeatedly. He experiences a painful infectious hemorrhoid when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] inherits $1 million from his grandmother and uses it to buy his own amusement park in ""[[Cartmanland]]"". He also experienced renal failure and needed a kidney transplant in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"". In ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", sickness apparently prevents Kyle from practicing Guitar Hero as much as [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] does. By contrast, in ""[[Chickenpox]]"", he is the only person in his class who does not easily catch the illness, even after playing a [[Ooky Mouth|game]] in which Kenny spit into his mouth and he had to swallow it while saying, ""Ooky Mouth"". He ultimately catches it after prolonged exposure to Stan and Cartman, and contracts a more severe case than any of the other children.

Kyle and Cartman share the AB negative blood type, as revealed in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"". It was also revealed in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"" that Kyle is diabetic, which may be the root for his many health concerns.

He is also shown to not have great oral health after getting two dental fillings in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"".

Like the other boys, Kyle is rarely grounded. He does regret most of the things he is grounded for. Kyle has been grounded on the following occasions:

Kyle has committed various crimes over the course of the series.
In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Kyle is involved in an online counseling startup company. He becomes skeptic towards Cartman, who had converted into Judaism and became a rabbi.

At the end of ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', Kyle, Cartman, and Stan travel back in time and successfully changed the future, setting a new timeline where Kyle has [[Future Kyle's Kids|two children]].

[[File:1213preview.jpg|thumb|Kyle without his hat in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]""]]
Kyle wears a greenish lime ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens. Kyle weighs 83 lbs. as stated in ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"". Underneath his hat, he has red hair, much like his mother's. This was first shown in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]];"" he is seen without his hat in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"", ""[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]"", ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", ""[[W.T.F.]]"", ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", and the [[Coon and Friends]] arc (as his vigilante alter-ego, [[Human Kite]]). His hair is a nod to [[Matt Stone]]'s (his creator) old hairstyle, as well as his character in ""Cannibal! The Musical"", who also wore an ushanka. In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", he as depicted as a ninja with brown eyes.

In several episodes, he has appeared in different outfits other than his, such as in ""[[Margaritaville]]"", when [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] recommended that the townspeople wear bedsheets instead of normal clothes (and riding llamas, among other things) to propitiate the economy's anger, Kyle wore a red bed sheet in the form of a robe. Also, on several occasions, he has altered his Jewfro stylishly, as shown in ""South Park is Gay!"" (when he briefly followed the metrosexual fad), ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"" (in an exaggerated anchorman coif), ""Elementary School Musical (in the style of Corbin Bleu), and in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"" (when he 'transforms' into a Jerseyite). In ""[[Free Willzyx]]"", a photo-realistic image of him is drawn by the police (along with the other boys); his mother [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] comments that it is ""kind of a bad drawing"".

[[File:KyleOriginal.jpg|thumb|left|Kyle in the original Christmas short]]
In ""[[The List]]"", Kyle was voted the ugliest boy in class out of the 16 students attending the class. This shakes Kyle's confidence; he stoops down to the level of the ugly misfit kids at school (who are so ugly that he still stands out), who constantly talk about burning the school down. Eventually, Stan and Wendy informed Kyle that the list was the result of a corrupt compromise just before Kyle set the school on fire, relieving Kyle of his status as ugliest kid.

In the original Christmas short, Kyle's appearance was drastically different: Instead of his orange jacket, he wore a green jacket, and instead of an ushanka, he wore a yellow baseball cap and looked very similar to Stan.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Kyle has grown a full beard. He wears an orange jacket over a light green shirt, dark green pants, and brown shoes. He does not wear his trademark ushanka.
[[File:N22193014176 9369.jpg|thumb|200px|Kyle on Facebook]]
Originally, Kyle's personality was extremely similar to his best friend Stan's - he had firm morals and generally was the ""good boy"" of the group, often being the one to deliver the ""I learned something today"" speech at the end of the episodes. After the abandoned plan to kill Kyle off in Season Five (that honor went, predictably, to Kenny) his personality was changed - most notably, his temper shortened considerably. Like his mother, Kyle does speeches to say what he thinks is right,

Kyle has extremely strong beliefs, and when forced to question them, he becomes very upset and has somewhat of a short temper (especially when it comes to Cartman. This is has caused a lot of fights between the two boys). For the most part, Kyle bases his decisions on both his emotions and beliefs; therefore, he is easily coaxed into fights or manipulated by his feelings, an example of this being when Cartman sang [[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch|a song about his mother being a ""bitch""]] and got everyone to join in, which annoyed Kyle. As a result, this has happened at least twice (''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]""). Cartman is more than happy to poke fun at Kyle in other ways as well, which has landed him in trouble many times. However, Kyle has been known to abandon his beliefs if there is a lot of money in it for him and self-justify himself despite knowing how wrong he is- he only changes his mind when he realizes he is turning into Cartman (""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"" and ""[[Raising the Bar]]""). Out of all the major characters, Kyle seems to have the greatest moral standing, often refusing to go along with acts he finds wrong or evil, though he is easily pressured into going through on them by his friends.

Kyle seems to have a strong fraternal instinct. Despite his initial displeasure after learning that Ike was his adopted brother in ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"", he recalls his bond with Ike prior and protects him when misconceiving that Ike was in immediate danger. Kyle has, in numerous episodes, dedicated all of his focus on saving Ike or Ike's general well-being. (""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", ""[[Canada on Strike]]"", ""[[Fatbeard]]"", and ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"") In the ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", he was initially the first one to show concern for the new neighbor's son by promptly tending to [[Blanket Jackson|Blanket]]'s scraped knee when he was unnoticed by his father ""[[Michael Jackson|Mr. Jefferson]]"". Throughout the episode, Kyle willingly looks out for Blanket: caring for his wound, taking him to Stan's house after showing outrage that Blanket was found alone in his backyard, putting him to bed, trying to hide him from his neglectful father, and defending him by delivering that Mr.Jefferson should be more responsible for Blanket's well-being and should act as more a father figure.

Despite his short temper, Kyle has a wide imagination and is easily the most compassionate of [[the boys]], evident by how he did not find the invasive gossip from Eavesdropper to be amusing unlike the majority of the other kids in his class. He shows genuine empathy by reasoning that others would not find the site to be funny if it wrote about them (""[[Bass to Mouth]]""). Though, Kyle can also be mean and sometimes neurotic. He also is known to be the most sensible and intelligent of the four and even though he sometimes puts his own emotions before common sense, he usually manages to find logical solutions to problems - solutions which are often ignored in favor of something ridiculous (Cartman's ""psychic abilities"", for example - although Kyle did manage to offer his solution through his own equally fraudulent ""psychic abilities"" (""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"")). This is yet another thing that annoys Kyle.

After PC Principal overheard that Kyle did not have a glowing opinion of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], he was harassed until he was forced to compromise. This ultimately lost him a lot of respect, as seen by the death glares he receives whenever he tries to make one of his speeches.

As noted by Butters in ""[[Going Native]]"", Kyle believes he knows everything, or at the very least believes everything has a logical explanation, and is quick to dismiss any supernatural phenomenon. He was rather upset when he was wrong in ""[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]"", and oftentimes he will sulk into an upset mood when something does not go his way.

Kyle is one of the leaders of the male student population, along with Cartman, Kenny, and most notably Stan. He gets along with most characters, although his temper sometimes alienates children. He is shown to not have a great relationship with girls, finding it gross when [[Bebe Stevens]] had arranged for [[Wendy Testaburger]] to have her kiss Kyle in Stan's clubhouse in ""[[Clubhouses]]"". Although, it is seen he is somewhat friendly with Wendy, often talking with her in background scenes.

Kyle is best friends with [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]. They are the closest out of the four boys, and they are generally seen together on the show, standing next to each other as well as sitting together on the school bus. Kyle shares an affinity with Stan in many ways (particularly early in the show, when there were fewer distinctions to be drawn between their personalities), and they genuinely care about each other. They almost always side together on the many issues they encounter, mainly when it is Cartman who is opposing them. This is frequently manifested when there is a conflict between Kyle and Cartman, and Stan offers support to Kyle by siding with him.

The two have their differences, with Kyle sometimes becoming frustrated with Stan when they have divergent perspectives on something he feels strongly about, and Stan in turn becomes concerned when Kyle gets obsessed in his rivalry with Cartman. Though rare, they have had serious disagreements and even ""broken up"" seven times (in the episodes ""[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]"", ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", ""[[Butterballs]]"", ""[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]"" and ""[[Black Friday]]""), but they have almost always reconciled in the end (with the exception of ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", although they made up in [[Ass Burgers|the next episode]]). It is when their friendship is so tested that its depth is best illustrated on the show, as in ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", where their falling-out creates the major conflict of the story. The rift formed between them helps Stan realize that what he most enjoyed about his success was not success for its own sake, but rather, sharing the experience with his best friend. Hearing this from Stan, a previously spurned Kyle rejoins him in picking up where they left off with renewed enthusiasm (only to be called fags by the game after hitting a million points).

The strength of their friendship and mutual dedication has been demonstrated on the show many times. In ""[[The List]]"", Kyle is voted the ugliest of all the boys in his class. This depresses him a great deal, and Stan, seeing how it has affected him, tries to get the girls to change the list with the help of [[Wendy Testaburger]] (ultimately uncovering the fact that the list was wrongfully altered and that Kyle was not in fact voted last). The two have even helped save each other's lives numerous times. When Kyle develops renal failure in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"", Stan gladly offers to donate one of his own kidneys to save his life, and ultimately orchestrates the plan that tricks Cartman (the only compatible donor) into donating one of his. Another example can be found in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"", where Stan is trapped in Imaginationland and Kyle is the only one who can hear his voice. Kyle goes to extreme measures, including breaking into the Pentagon, to stop the government from nuking Imaginationland (and Stan along with it). Kyle even agreed to kill Jesus (at His request) despite his strong misgivings in order to help him save Stan's life in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"".

Kyle and Stan's friendship has been mocked several times by others (particularly Cartman). At one point Stan's dad [[Randy Marsh]] even told him that they should not hang out too much together or else people would start to think ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub|they are 'funny']]"" (i.e. homosexual). Others have insinuated they were gay, as in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", where Cartman asked them, ""Aw, do you want me to get you a room so you can make out?"" (to which Kyle and Stan responded by kicking him in the nuts repeatedly).

It is shown that Kyle could possibly be Stan's lawyer, seeing as he was sitting beside Stan after he was sued by Cartman in ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"".

In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", after Stan is diagnosed as being a cynical asshole Kyle first attempts to cope with him. But, after he gets worse, Kyle decides that he was too much of a killjoy and starts to avoid him with Kenny and Cartman. Finally, he realizes Stan has changed and ends their friendship. However, they do not make up at the end of the episode like the other times, and with Stan not showing a single sign of getting better (along with the doctors diagnosis that he will never get better). It seems to be permanent, but in ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", they made up at the very end.

Kyle values Stan's opinion of him. Throughout ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"", Kyle would repeatedly seek Stan out to explain his involvement with Cartman's Crack Baby association, in an attempt to make sure Stan did not think less of him.

Cartman is disliked by most of the South Park kids and Kyle is no exception, also getting referred to an 'asshole' by the adults. although in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", Kyle and Cartman are seen bonding closer to each other whilst Stan suffers his new found and alienating view that everything is ""shitty"". Nonetheless, The feud between the two has been a recurring theme since the show's beginning. Cartman and Kyle often exchange insults, with Kyle as the target of Cartman's anti-Semitism, and with Kyle taunting Cartman about his weight in return. Whenever making a point, Cartman will often try to outsmart Kyle, sometimes by making a bet with him just so that he can gloat in his face. Though Cartman usually winds up the loser of the argument, there are exceptions when Cartman's improbable assertions prove true. In such cases as in ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"", where Cartman saves the town from a hippie music festival, and Kyle is forced to watch Cartman play with his new [[Tonka RC Bulldozer]] in the school parking lot every day and in ""[[Imaginationland]]""; the episode begins with Cartman taking Kyle, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] and [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] into the forest because he had seen a leprechaun in the area; Kyle, of course, does not believe him, though Cartman turns out to be correct. [[File:ThePoorKid21.png|thumb|Cartman angry at Kyle.]] They often hang out together as a part of the core group of main characters, although Kyle does not include Cartman in all of his activities (as when he invites [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] instead of Cartman to his birthday party at [[Casa Bonita]] because he does not consider Cartman to be his friend).

[[File:CartmanKyle_smile.jpg|thumb|left|Cartman and Kyle smiling at each other and getting along at the end of ""[[You're Getting Old]]"".]]
On the rare occasions that Cartman's harassment leads the two to a physical confrontation, Kyle is consistently shown to have the advantage. For example, Kyle beats Cartman up in ""[[Kenny Dies]]"" upon discovering he never intended on getting stem cell research passed to potentially save Kenny. In a later episode, ""[[Goobacks]]"", while the four boys shovel the driveway of a woman's property, Cartman sits down chatting away on his cell phone while the others work diligently. Kyle confronts Cartman about not working and informs him that if he does not help, he would not get his share of the money, to which Cartman replies ""Hey! Don't you boss me around you fKyle's friendship with Kenny is not as strong as his friendship with Stan (in ""[[Chickenpox]]"" he claims that he does not ""give a rat's ass about Kenny"" to try and get out of spending the night at Kenny's poverty and then chickenpox stricken household) nor is it adversarial (like that with Cartman) but is clearly existent. They rarely interact one-on-one. Kyle regularly includes Kenny in many of his activities.

Although his friendship with Kenny is not as noticeable when Stan or Cartman are around, when the two are alone together they have been known to be quite friendly towards each other. Kyle promptly beats up Cartman in defense of Kenny's honor and memory following one of his ""permanent"" deaths in ""Kenny Dies"". In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", a once again dead Kenny bequeathed all of his belongings (except his [[List of Video Game References#PlayStation Portable|PSP]]) to Kyle and Stan, and in his will said, ''""Dudes, you were the best friends a guy could have"", ''to which Kyle responded'' ""That's really touching..."",'' indicating a meaningful relationship between the two''.'' He invited Kenny to Jew scouts in ""[[Jewbilee]]"", and in ""[[The Ring]]"" comforted Kenny before leaving to confront Disney about the purity rings, one of which was slowly turning Kenny into a boring douche.

[[File:1401_kyleButtersMudWrestleA.jpg|thumb|Kyle tries to help Butters in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"".]]
Kyle's friendship with Butters is fairly decent and he prefers him over Cartman; Kyle generally treats Butters well (such as when he defended Butters for not kissing a girl in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]""). Another example is when Kyle tried to help Butters when they were diagnosed as sex addicts in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"". However, like the other boys, he is not above using Butters as a ""guinea pig"" when it comes to experiments or undercover jobs, blaming him for writing ''[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]'' [[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs|in the episode of the same name.]] Furthermore, when Kenny was dead during the Sixth Season, he, along with Stan, would coerce Butters to do things by saying ""Kenny would have done it""; he would constantly talk about how Kenny was cool with the other two and abandon Butters until he would do, often dangerous, tasks. He also occasionally makes fun of Butters, swears at him or calls him names. Conversely, Butters has been shown to harass Kyle, as shown in ""[[The List]]"", and he has also ""bullied"" him for being Jewish, though this is usually under Cartman's influence.

Bebe Stevens had a crush on him in ""[[Clubhouses]]"", mainly because of her sudden interest in Kyle's ass. She wrote in a note that she ""could sleep for days on his perked cheeks"" and ""wanted to wear his ass as a hat."" Unfortunately, as the note was being passed around, it got to Stan, and Mr. Garrison thought that he was trying to pass it around, so he forced him to read it aloud to the class, and Stan subsequently got in trouble for that. Wendy then helps Bebe try to pursue a relationship with Kyle, who is oblivious to her attempts. It eventually becomes clear that Kyle does not share her feelings, as when he, Stan, Wendy and Bebe play Truth or Dare in Stan's clubhouse, Wendy dares Kyle to kiss Bebe on the lips, and when she does, Kyle expresses fear and shock and flees from the clubhouse. Bebe ultimately decided that she could not take the co-dependency of a relationship, and purported to ""break up"" with a mostly apathetic Kyle.

The only time Kyle ever showed any interest in Bebe was when she began developing breasts in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", (although every other boy in the class shared the same sudden interest). Later in the episode, Kyle helps her to throw rocks at cars with the other boys, and eventually goes into an ape-like primal state with all of the other boys. At the end, Kyle and all of the other boys realized that they were attracted to Bebe's breasts and decided they should not be influenced by them.

Kyle's general ignorance and (possible fear) of girls (mainly in earlier episodes) could stem from the fact he is only 10, and is not into girls yet. Or perhaps he is wary because of his parents, whose relationship at times slightly resembles 'master and pet' especially when his mother is protesting about things.

Kyle first becomes concerned for Heidi in ""[[Sons A Witches]]"", when Cartman devises plans to kill her off right in front of him. Kyle reprimands Cartman for this, saying that ""Heidi is a nice girl"", and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her, adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly.

They briefly date in ""[[Doubling Down]]"", after Kyle convinced Heidi to break up with Cartman, and they develop mutual feelings for each other. Their relationship was later ruined by Cartman who tricks her into believing that Kyle ""planned"" to have her break up with Cartman just so he could ruin their relationship, and inadvertently calls him a ""dirty Jew"", shocking him. Heidi breaks up with Kyle, and walks away with Cartman who makes an evil smile at him.

In ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", Kyle (along with Stan, Kenny, Cartman and all the other boys in the class) develops a crush on their slutty substitute teacher, Ms. Ellen. Chef eventually tells the boys that Ms. Ellen is a lesbian; however, since neither Kyle nor his friends (not even Kenny, whose understanding concerning sexual topics is usually greater than that of the other boys') understand what a lesbian is, their crush on Ms. Ellen continues in a misguided attempt to become lesbians themselves. The crush evaporates, however, when Ms. Ellen is removed as a substitute and eventually launched into the sun by a large scale plot orchestrated by [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]].

Rebecca was a girl Kyle had a crush on in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Phonics]]"". The two first met at the Annual School Bee for South Park Elementary, despite the fact that she and her brother Mark were home-schooled. Rebecca lacked knowledge about love and was quite inept socially due to her sheltered upbringing, however, a determined Kyle explained to her the importance of love. They then kissed after he explained love is displayed by a kiss, and almost immediately, Rebecca's confidence grew. The two agreed to go to the School Dance together, but Rebecca ended up making out with other boys at the due, much to Kyle's shock. She has not appeared or been mentioned since, so it is a major possibility that Kyle had got over her.

Nichole was interested in a relationship with Kyle at the beginning of ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"". Cartman told Nichole that Kyle was his boyfriend, which she understood and accepted. Due to intervention from Eric Cartman, Nichole chose to have a relationship with [[Tolkien Black]].

After Nichole's relationship with Tolkien ended, temporarily, Kyle took her to a Denver Nuggets game, in order to attempt to have a relationship. This was quickly thwarted by Cartman, who announced his love for Kyle at the basketball game.

Kyle showed an interest in [[Leslie Meyers|Leslie]] while protecting her in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"",before Leslie was revealed to be a robot and killed by [[PC Principal]].

Stan Marsh,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Stan_Marsh,,"is one of ''South Park''<nowiki/>'s main characters along with [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick]].

Attempts to save [[Baby Cows|baby cows]]' lives by stealing them from [[Farmer Carl Denkins]] and locks him Cartman, Kyle, and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in his room. Originally it technically is not terrorism but soon Cartman gives demand for a missile, an arsenal of weapons, and the name for veal changed to tortured baby cows. In ""[[Free Willzyx]]"", him and his friends break into SeaWorld Park and steal the orca named [[Jambu]]. [[The boys]] were tricked by two employees into believing the whale wanted to be free and misses its family on the Moon. The boys eventually succeed with sending the whale to the Moon with the help of the Mexican Aeronautic Space Agency. During the events of ""[[Whale Whores]]"", he joins the anti-whaling reality show ''[[Whale Wars]]'' and sinks many Japanese whaling ships with a flare gun and Molotov cocktails. He, Kenny, and Cartman get arrested by the Japanese and put in a prison cell together. In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", he broke into a random building while drunk and under the manipulation of the [[Secret Society of Cynics]] and began randomly firing an Uzi gun which contained several restaurant owners plotting to shut down Cartman's hamburger business.

In ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"", Stan breaks into the [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] after it is forced to close because he is desperate to build a bear for Butters.

'''Illegal downloading:''' In [[Christian Rock Hard]], he downloads songs illegally which get him, Kenny, and Kyle arrested. However he never knew this law existed.

'''Arson/framing: '''In ""[[Pre-School]]"", he and the others got [[Trent Boyett]] to set a fire in their preschool classroom and frame Trent for the crime, and in ""[[Butt Out]]"". However both of these arson's were accidental and unintentional and therefore do not count on his criminal record.

'''Filing a false police report''': In ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", he lied to the police about his parents and [[Shelley Marsh|sister]] abusing him.

'''Hit-and-run''': In ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"", Stan and Cartman drove a boat into a beaver dam, which resulted in the flooding of [[Beaverton]], and the deaths of 'hundreds of millions', despite the population of the town being only 8,000. It was also reported that people were looting, raping, and resorting to cannibalism (which is a stretch). However this was also an accident because Stan did not know that this accident would go very far and does not count on his criminal record.

'''Piracy:''' In ""[[Whale Whores]]"", he sinks a Japanese boat. However, this does not count because the ''Whale Wars'' show was supported by national television.

'''Violation of firearm laws/threatening with a deadly weapon:''' In [[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]], Stan held Kyle's head at gunpoint and began to threaten him before revealing that he was the one who defecated in the school urinal simply to avoid missing out on recess, He was eventually punished by [[Mr. Mackey]] for it.

'''Attempted murder:''' Stan has attempted to kill Cartman with a laser gun when Cartman almost destroyed the world with his trapper keeper in [[Trapper Keeper]]. In [[Spontaneous Combustion]] he and Kyle tied Cartman to a cross, knowing full well that he would die, in order to give [[Gerald|Kyle's dad]] a resurrection. He has also been known at attempting to murder [[Marvin Marsh|his own grandpa]] (at his grandpa's request). However he unintentionally attempts these assisted suicides.

'''Murder:''' In ""[[Pinkeye]]"", he and Cartman killed many zombies by cutting them in half with chainsaws. What neither of them knew at the time that all they had to do was kill the original zombie, Kenny.

'''Attempted unlicensed surgery:''' In ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"", when Cartman refused to donate his kidney to a dying Kyle, Stan tries to take it by force by breaking into his house and removing it with a saw, however Cartman outsmarts him by using the ""Kidney Blocker 2000"" to prevent this.

'''Unlicensed surgery:''' In ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", He, Kyle and Cartman preformed unlicensed liposuction on Butters with a hose in order to get him thinner in hopes of getting money from a weight loss scam. They even framed Butters by simply running away and hiding, causing yet another grounding for Butters from his parents.

'''Theft:''' Cartman misled him into stealing a boat which ends up breaking a beaver dam. But this is mostly Cartman's fault.

'''Black marketing:''' In ""[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]"", Stan came up with a plan with the boys in breaking into any rich kid's house and placing a tooth under their pillow and have their parents place money under their pillow only for them to steal it from them afterwards. Though this idea was already used by a boy named [[Loogie]] who started a business in doing these and ended up joining his business, thought one of the members of the [[American Dental Association]] suspected this and was later caught by them but was not punished for due to Kyle's rather unusual altering reality abilities. Since this is black marketing, this act was illegal and branded on his criminal record.

'''Underage smoking:''' He along with Cartman, Kenny, and Kyle smoked in order to not be like the anti-smoking group [[Butt Out!]].

'''Underage drinking and alcoholism:''' He was given alcohol by a group of people who supposedly had [[Asperger's Syndrome]], because they all literally saw the world as ""shit"". They consistently make Stan drink to do ""missions"", and although Stan later said he was through with that group, he still had a bottle of whiskey in his drawer. However, he had few alternatives because he apparently requires alcohol to cure himself of his cynicism.

'''Indecent exposure:''' In ""[[Butterballs]]"", Stan's awareness video about bullying fails and the school ends up being sued by [[Dr. Mehmet Oz]]. Stan resorts to going to [[San Diego]], stripping his clothes, and masturbating ([[Jackin' it in San Diego|or rather dancing]]) in public though he was never arrested for this act and this rather amused San Diego's populace. He performed this act again in ""[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]"" when he successfully raised awareness of how horrible ziplining was for him.

'''Property damage:''' In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", Stan and the rest of the fourth grade boys except for Kenny, destroy all of Cartman's electrical devices into believing he was [[Skankhunt42]]. Later on, he and the other boys regretted what they did when they figured out that Cartman was not Skankhunt42.

Stan attends [[South Park Elementary]] as part of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s [[The 4th Grade|Fourth Grade Class]] (formerly Third). Stan's father [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] is a geologist, and his mother [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] is a secretary at [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]]. He briefly had a step-father in ""[[Clubhouses]]"", named [[Roy]].

Since its beginning, the series has had a running gag where when Kenny is killed, Stan will announce, ""Oh my God, you/he/she/they/we killed Kenny!"" Kyle will then respond: ""You/that/those/we're bastard(s)!"", or vice versa.

Stan's often-used catchphrase during the early seasons was ""Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here,"" which originated in the second ''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]'' short, though the profanity was bleeped out. In recent episodes, however this catchphrase has faded.

In many episodes, Stan sums up the episode's main points in a small speech that often begins with, ""You know, I learned something today."" However, it is more common for Kyle to do it, and a few other characters such as Cartman and the [[Mayor McDaniels|Mayor]] have as well. Stan is often shown with his hands in his coat pockets as he walks, or when in deep thought.

In the later episodes, Stan also has a habit of pinching the bridge of his (unseen) nose and shutting his eyes tightly when frustrated or exasperated, saying phrases such as ""Oh no."" A good example of this is in ""[[ManBearPig]]"" where he does this motion when on the phone with [[Al Gore]]. Another example is in ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", when he does it all the way home from the set of ''Wheel of Fortune''. His mother is also seen doing the motion in that scene. He also does it the whole time when the reporter is talking to Randy in ""[[Goobacks]]"". The gesture seems to be a learned habit developed by his constant frustration with his parents. Kyle also has a mannerism like this, often closing his eyes when stressed. This is not uncommon with Stan and Kyle, often throughout the series being criticized as having the same personality.

Stan often groans, ""Aw-awww!"" when he is upset or in disbelief, which seems to be an inherited habit; his father does this sometimes as well. This is the same catchphrase [[Trey Parker]] used in the 1998 sports comedy film ''BASEketball''.

If he agrees with someone or is unsure of something, he will often state ""sure"" or ""yeah"" in a very dull, unimpressed manner. Whenever he gets mad, frustrated, or gets dragged into something, he often says ""Goddamnit!"", not to be confused with Cartman's catchphrase, ""Aw! God-''damn it!''"" Often in school, he would say ""Oooooh....."" with a slightly higher pitched tone than his normal voice. He will often express shock with ""Jesus Christ!"" This is evident in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"" and ""[[About Last Night...]]"".

'''Eco-terrorism/breaking and entering:''' Attempts to save [[Baby Cows|baby cows]]' lives by stealing them from [[Farmer Carl Denkins]] and locks him Cartman, Kyle, and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in his room. Originally it technically is not terrorism but soon Cartman gives demand for a missile, an arsenal of weapons, and the name for veal changed to tortured baby cows.

Later on, he and the other boys regretted what they did when they figured out that Cartman was not Skankhunt42.

Stan has been shown to be quite able to drive in quite a few episodes, despite his age and height, such as in ""[[Towelie]]"" (with Kenny operating the gas and brake pedals), ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"" (he piloted Santa's back-up sleigh after Santa was shot down over Iraq), ""[[Bloody Mary]]"" (when he drove Randy to the Virgin Mary statue), and ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"" (when he drove a modified bus through the hordes of homeless and then lured them away to California).

Like the other South Park boys, Stan is also rarely grounded. He usually does not understand why he gets grounded after doing something that causes him to be grounded and unlike the other boys, Stan's grounding limit is usually determined by a random time by his parents and is usually not set to two to three weeks. Stan has been grounded on the following occasions:

Stan shows his leadership skills as (Pirate) Captain Marsh of the Sea Shepherd in ""[[Whale Whores]]"". He sinks several of the Japanese boats to protect the whales and dolphins in the Ocean until their boat was hit by Japanese kamikaze planes. Stan is often selected to be the captain of assorted sporting events such as captain and pitcher of the baseball team in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"" and captain/quarterback in football as seen in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"". When the boys are playing police in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", Stan acts in the role of a lead detective during the investigations. Although there is no specific leader within his primary group of friends, Stan is often the one to motivate the other boys, due to his moral beliefs, as seen in episodes such as [[Fun with Veal]].

In earlier episodes, such as ""[[Summer Sucks]]"" and ""[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]"", Stan began to show an aptitude for music. He is also shown to be capable of writing music, as seen in ""[[Chef Aid]]"".

In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", he and [[the boys]] started a boy-band group named [[Fingerbang]]. They made a video for the song ""[[Fingerbang (Song)|Fingerbang]]"" and performed it at the [[South Park Mall]].

In ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"", he was seen playing guitar. He was also seen playing a guitar in ""[[Smug Alert!]]"", where he wrote and performed [[Hey People, You Gotta Drive Hybrids Already|a song about the importance of hybrid cars]].

In ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"", his father taught him how to line dance to the song, ""Achy Breaky Heart"" by Billy Ray Cyrus. He and the rest of [[The South Park Diggities]] participated successfully in a dance competition with [[The Orange County Crew]].

In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", the boys formed a rock band, called [[Moop]]. The group refused to play their music in a protest of illegal music downloading on the internet.

Stan has been shown to be able to play ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' very well in ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"". He was able to successfully achieve his goal of scoring 1,000,000 points with Kyle in cooperative mode.

In ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"", he and the boys sang ""[[California Loves the Homeless]]"" to a large crowd of homeless people, in an effort to drive them away from South Park.

In ""[[Pandemic]]"" and ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"", the boys formed a Peruvian flute band with [[Craig Tucker]]. They played ""[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]"" at an outdoor mall in Colorado, where they were arrested by the Department of Homeland Security.

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' and ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", Stan was shown to be a talented vocalist.

In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", in an effort to become more popular, like [[Bridon Gueermo]], he and the boys performed a musical number, similar to those of ''High School Musical''.

In ""[[Butterballs]]"", his musical talents were shown again, where he was shown to have written and directed the musical video for ""[[Make Bullying Kill Itself]]"", a ""lip-dub"" video aimed to stop bullying.

In ""[[The Cissy]]"", he is shown singing ""[[Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday)|Feeling Good on a Wednesday]]"" in the ""Cissies"" bathroom.

In ""[[Band in China]]"", Stan forms a heavy metal band called [[Crimson Dawn]], which consists of him as the lead singer, Kenny as bassist, Butters as the lead guitarist, and Jimmy as the drummer.

Stan is quite athletically proficient, and is regularly the captain or star player of his school's sports teams, except in basketball where Kyle is the best player in the school, and dodgeball where [[Pip Pirrip]] is the best player. He was the quarterback of the school football team in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"". In baseball, Stan is seen hitting home runs and is the pitcher (though this is rare in professional baseball) and apparent captain of South Park's team in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"". He and the other boys also play baseball in ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"". He was also a member of the South Park dodgeball team that won the world championship and was on the pee-wee hockey team when he was 4 years old, revealed in ""[[Stanley's Cup]]"". Stan also coached a [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team|pee-wee hockey team]] that episode and showed he quit from hockey after failing to win a hockey game for the team on a 'breakaway'. His favorite sports team, regarding the setting, Colorado, is the [[Denver Broncos]]. He also manages to go from a beginner skier to a near-professional in only two days in ""[[Asspen]]"" (thanks to the timely use of a montage). The episode ends with him successfully skiing the K-13, ""the most dangerous run in America"", in order to beat a much older man who repeatedly insulted him and challenged him to the run. He also tries out for the South Park wrestling team in ""[[W.T.F.]]"", but leaves after the coach makes Butters do a ""gay"" move on Cartman. In the episode, he goes on to form a wrestling league with the other boys.

For his age, Stan appears proficient with weaponry. In ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", he was able to hold an M16 assault rifle (but did not actually use it), and in ""[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]"", he was able to get hold of a handgun. In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", Stan wields a pair of tonfa. In ""[[Whale Whores]]"", Stan was able to take a flare gun and fire a flare into the fuel storage of a Japanese whaling ship, resulting in the whole ship blowing up. He commandeered the ''Sea Shepard'' in the same episode and sunk a fleet of Japanese whaling ships with a rather impressive arsenal for a 9-year-old, including Molotov cocktails and a large caliber deck gun. His proficiency is probably a result of his [[Jimbo Kern|Uncle Jimbo's]] influence. He was also able to kill [[Scuzzlebutt]] in ""[[Volcano]]"". Also, in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", he uses the Sword of a Thousand Truths successfully (however, this is in a video game). He also broke into a building while wielding and firing an Uzi gun at random areas of the building while intoxicated in ""[[Ass Burgers]]"".

In ""[[Cartmanland]]"", Stan changes his voice in order to get into Cartman's theme park, Cartmanland, pretending to be a child named ""Mick Ganer"". In ""[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]"", he changed his voice to sound like Cartman in order to finish a Christmas short; the two of them are also voiced by the same person, Trey Parker.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he becomes an online whiskey consultant for Post-Modem Beveragetainment Online Services, living with a personified [[Alexa]] as his personal assistant.

In an alternate timeline seen at the end of ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', he becomes a chief master sergeant in the United States Space Force, having returned from [[Mars]] to attend a party at [[Denny's|Denny's Applebee's Max]].

Stan is mostly shown wearing a brown jacket with a red collar, a blue hat with a red puffball and rim, and blue jeans. Under his jacket, he either wears a red and blue baseball shirt or a white T-shirt/v-neck. He also wears a blue [[Terrance and Phillip]] shirt to bed and a green suit for special occasions. In some episodes, it is clear he has black hair (like his father [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]) when his hat is partially or completely removed - this was first seen in ""[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]"".

All of the boys' hats are removed and their hair is seen for an extended period during the shower room scene in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", although Kenny's head is only seen from behind. Stan also apparently has blue eyes, as noted by Kyle when Butters draws their cartoon forms in ""[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]"", but this is uncertain, because Kyle said it was similar because he had a sharper nose, so it could have been a mistake.

In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", he was portrayed with brown eyes, so odds are it was Butters' error when his eyes were blue. Even at a young age, Stan has always worn his red and blue hat (as shown in ""[[Pre-School]]"") and even sleeps with it on.

In ""[[The List]]"", he ranked third in the initial corrupt list of which boy was cutest. However, he was not mentioned among those who had to change places due to the corruption, so it is possible that he remained the third cutest boy, behind [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] (who was actually in the bottom five somewhere) and [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]].

In the [[The Spirit of Christmas|original Christmas short]], he had a different appearance; his hat was the same, but it was fully red, he also had a dot as a nose and his jacket was blue.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', his hair is graying on the sides, and he has a five-o' clock shadow. He wears a red long-sleeved shirt with brown vest, blue pants, and black shoes.

Stan is generally the most tender and sensitive of the four boys. For example, in ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", he finds it difficult to see Kenny in his ill state, and in ""[[Raisins]]"" he becomes depressed after losing his girlfriend to [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]]. Also, in ""[[Fun with Veal]]"", Stan is the only one who stopped eating meat completely when the boys found that veal was actually ""tortured baby cow meat"". However, in some episodes he does not seem to care when people die, as in ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"" and ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"".

Stan is often very moral. This is evident in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"", when he, Kenny, [[Timmy]], and Butters challenged the character [[Miss Information]] and her shop of alternative medicine, in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", when he helped battle [[David Blaine]]'s suicidal cult, and in ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"" where he accuses the psychic medium, [[John Edward]], of being a fake. In this episode he also gained possession of his own show (while trying to prove that cold reading was fake) and battled with John Edward in a ""Psychic Showdown"".

He also showed some heroism in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"" by stating he would gladly donate a kidney to Kyle, even if it ""hurt a whole lot"". In ""[[Whale Whores]]"", he was also the only one in South Park to stand up and help whales and dolphins that were being slaughtered by the Japanese. He was angry that the cast of ''Whale Wars'' was not doing enough to help whales and dolphins and took matters into his own hands. It also shows Stan is a whale and dolphin lover and he tells the Japanese that it was a cow and a chicken that nuked Hiroshima, not a whale and a dolphin, in order to save them all being wiped out by the Japanese.

He is usually the one who is unaffected by the many scams, cults, and mass influences that South Park has been subjected to, and has a knack for seeing through falsely glorified practices and celebrities. In ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"" and ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", he is the only one of the boys shown to believe in scams, cults, and that an alien makes everyone see things normal. Conversely, sometimes Kyle takes on this role, and it is Stan who is the gullible one, such as in ""[[Chinpokomon]]"", or the metrosexual trend in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"".

However, Stan has been shown to have an overwhelmingly clearer understanding of scams and corporate corruption than anyone else in South Park, and has an especially good grasp of the dangers of cults. It is notable that he has a tendency to ridicule, make enemies out of, and/or bring shame to a very large number of celebrities that are shown in a poor light within the show. This may be because his father (Stan's major adult influence) has shown to be rather incompetent and immature, so Stan is suspicious and distrustful of adults.

Stan and Kyle's personalities tend to be similar, especially in the earlier seasons, but are not quite interchangeable, and they have developed more distinct and complex personalities during the show's run. Still, they are considered the closest friends out of the four, though Cartman and Kenny do not have a close bond of their own.

Stan's depression is also a recurring theme throughout the show. He became terribly depressed when Wendy broke up with him in ""[[Raisins]]"", briefly joining the [[Goth Kids]]. Stan also became incredibly depressed and adopted a cynical world view in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"" and ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", where everything to him literally sounded and looked ""like shit"". In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", he uses alcohol to make the world seem happier.

Stan may suffer from asthma, as an inhaler was shown among the things Cartman claims in ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"", although this was never mentioned in the series again.

Stan is an avid animal lover - he gets a dog in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"". He resists the influence of his uncle Jimbo to hunt in ""[[Volcano]]"" (he mentions this in ""[[Death]]""), became a [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|P.E.T.A.]] member in ""[[Douche and Turd]]"" (although he had the choice of joining them or being killed), tried to save baby cows in ""[[Fun with Veal]]"", and attempted to return a goat to its rightful owners in ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"". Although well-intentioned, these interventions often lead him and his friends into serious trouble. Stan (as well as the rest of the boys from 4th grade) also went to Mexico and managed to get the Mexican Space Program to take an orca to the moon in a bid to save it (with all the kids in South Park having been led to believe he was a killer whale from the moon) in ""[[Free Willzyx]]"". In ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"", after he and Cartman crash a boat into a beaver dam and swim to shore, seeing the boat blow up, Stan says, ""I hope we didn't hurt any beavers."" In ""[[Fun with Veal]]"" he briefly turned to vegetarianism, but he quickly gave it up when he was plagued by a disease that literally ""turned him into a pussy"", sprouting actual vaginas on his body, a disease called [[Vaginitis]]. He also sets out to save the whales and dolphins from the Japanese in ""[[Whale Whores]]"". It is revealed in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"" that he is afraid of snakes.

Stan is shown to sympathize with others, most evidently seen in ""[[ManBearPig]]"", in which he partially defends [[Al Gore]] because he feels sorry for him, due to him ""not having any friends"". However, when this pity backfires and lands him in a cave where Al Gore almost (unintentionally) drowns him, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny, he lashes out and brings Al Gore into a cold, hard reality, shouting, ""Stay away from us, asshole! I only felt sorry for you because you didn't have any friends! But now I know why you don't have any friends! You just use Manbearpig as a way of getting attention for yourself because you're a loser!"" This does not affect Al Gore, however, as he dons a cape and says he will go and make a movie starring himself ''(An Inconvenient Truth)''. Ironically, Al Gore is also responsible for the deaths of Stan and everyone else in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"", even though they were revived by Butters.

When angered, Stan is often quite reluctant to continue/do anything that will further contribute to the obscurity or direness of the situation. This is shown in ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"" after he finds out [[Woodland Critters|the Critters]], whom he helped, were giving birth to the [[Anti-Christ]], he decided not to attempt to set things right (although did eventually after much nagging from the episode's narrator) also in this episode, we found out that Stan was a Christian. Technically, though, this was not him - just a fictional version of him created by Eric Cartman for his Christmas story. For the first seven seasons of the show, Stan's sporadic girlfriend was [[Wendy Testaburger]]. In the early days of the series, a running gag would be that Stan would throw up out of nervousness whenever Wendy spoke to him. As the show progressed, however, the Stan-Wendy storyline diminished greatly. In the penultimate episode of the seventh season, ""[[Raisins]]"", Wendy had [[Bebe]] tell Stan that ""she breaks up"", for Tolkien, causing Stan to go into extreme depression and join the [[Goth Kids]]. He recovered, thanks to Butters, who was dealing with his own heartbreak and had decided that he would rather be ""a crying little pussy than a faggy goth kid"". Stan eventually got over the break-up by telling Wendy ""you're a bitch"" and giving Tolkien the middle finger while saying ""Tolkien, right here, buddy"". Wendy has played a much smaller part in the series since this episode. It became apparent that Stan had some lingering feelings for Wendy in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"" when he grew insanely jealous of Kyle working with her. He, however, decided to show her up by responding to her compliments with ""as if I give a crap about what you think, Wendy"". At the end of ""[[The List]]"", however, Stan and Wendy reconciled. They inadvertently have an adventure together, and at the end, Wendy admits to having a good time with Stan and believes he has changed since they were last together. They lean in to kiss, but in a near-exact copy of a scene at the end of ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", Stan pukes on Wendy. Their status as boyfriend and girlfriend is affirmed in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"". Also, in the Season Thirteen episode, ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", Butters tries to get Wendy to work for him in his ""Kissing Company"" referring to her as a ""bitch"" and Stan says ""Butters, Dude, you can't call my girlfriend a bitch"" and threatens to hurt him if he continues. Stan is shown to be a bully at times when he and Cartman mention that they sat on a kid and farted on him. He and Cartman also beat up a random third grader when they enter fourth grade. He also threatens Butters for attempting to steal the video from him in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"" while trying to get to the [[Two Towers Video Store|video store]].

Stan is frequently embarrassed or infuriated at the stupidity of his parents and the other adults of the town, and he often goes against what his parents do. This is prominently shown in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"" when he finds out about the actor portraying his future self and goes so far as to trick Randy to cut the hand off of the actor to try and get them to admit they lied. In ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", the escalating paranoia over child abductions leads the parents to send all the town's children away, in fear that they (the parents) will abduct their own kids. As the children wander off on their own, Stan remarks to Kyle, ""Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid,"" and as they rejoin their families at the conclusion of the episode, ""Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but, Jesus Christ....."" In ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"" he admits to breaking a beaver dam, and the adults assume that this was instead a message urging them not to waste energy on pointing the finger of blame. After several failed attempts to explain that it actually was him who broke the dam through everyone saying ""I broke the dam"", he shouted, ''""I BROKE THE FUCKING DAM!""'' and explained the exact sequence of events without any effect on the adults. The rather displaced cynicism that he exhibits when dealing with adults, as well as his inability to be impressed by celebrities or fads may also come from the fact that, due to his parents, he has probably never respected or trusted adults. Also in ""[[Crème Fraiche]]"", he says ""You guys, my dad is retarded but he is not that retarded"" when Cartman presents his idea to Stan on how to trick Randy into not wanting to cook.

In ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"", Stan was thought to be the leader of Scientology having scored the highest thetan levels since [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and was quickly approached by [[Tom Cruise]], whom Stan called an average actor. After hearing this Tom Cruise shouted, ""I'm a failure in the eyes of the prophet!"" and locked himself in Stan's closet. After unsuccessfully attempting to get him out, Stan shouts down the stairs to Randy, ""DAD! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!"" (which is a reference to the rumors that Tom Cruise was gay, with ""coming out of the closet"" meaning when a gay man admits he is gay). Stan is later told that Scientology is fake and that if he writes anything almost everyone would believe it and he could make up to $3 million. Later on, when he reads his new writings to his loving public, his morality objected to it and he told everyone that Scientology was fake and that it was a wrong way to answer the many questions. Stan was then sued by almost everyone, including Cruise and the head of the church, without anyone taking any action until he lost his temper, shouting, ""Well go on then! SUE ME!""

In ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", he is the only kid in the school who finds the option of voting between a [[Giant Douche|giant douche]] and a [[Turd Sandwich|turd sandwich]] ""ridiculous"". He is beleaguered by Kyle, the school officials, and his parents, eventually bringing [[P. Diddy|Puff Daddy]] to South Park to tell him about the Vote or Die campaign, and then chased Stan around town with a gun and literally told him to ""vote or die"". He is later banished from town for not voting and is rescued by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] members, the leader of which tells him that in actuality ''all'' elections are between a douche and a turd, which convinces him to go back to town to vote.

In ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"", he is disgusted with The Passion of the Christ, calling it a ""snuff film"" and going, along with Kenny, to [[Mel Gibson]]'s house to get their money back. Mel Gibson turns out to be insane and rabidly masochistic, and attacks the two of them with a gun in a manner reminiscent of Daffy Duck after Stan calls him ""daffy"". Stan and Kenny then steal the money from Gibson's wallet and flee back to South Park, pursued by him. Later, when Gibson asserts that Stan cannot say that his film sucks because it is saying that Christianity sucks, Stan counters by saying that Christianity is fine, but focusing on how people died ends up with really bad results, convincing the town that Mel Gibson was wrong all along.

In ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"", Stan is led to believe he is the only boy of the four that has not yet had his period, and is left out by the other three due to him not being ""mature enough"". He later uses the only question available every two millennia to ask [[God]] (who had come down to Earth briefly) why he has not given him his period. After a long pause, God states the obvious: that he is a boy and should not get periods. The episode ends with everyone trying to kill Stan for using the only question on something so dumb.

In ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", he was made a member of a rabbit-worshipping cult-like group called the [[Hare Club for Men]], which his father, grandfather, and the entire male side of his family has been members in for generations.

After his tenth birthday in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", Stan became extremely cynical, viewing almost everything as ""shit"" and even seeing people poop out of their mouths. His cynicism becomes so serious his friendship with the other characters is destroyed. His parents also separate, causing Stan to move out of his childhood home, though it was shown in the next episode.

In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", the follow-up to ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", Stan is shown to still be depressed. Everything is still viewed as ""shit"" to him, he rides the bus alone, and appears uninterested in everything around him, later bursting out in class. Mr. Mackey tries to talk Stan out of his depression, to which Stan breaks down, crying, wanting everything to go back to what it was. [[Mr. Mackey]] incorrectly assumes that Stan developed Asperger syndrome from his flu shot last year. Sharon brings Stan to a clinic to get help, which is a front for a group who sees the world as Stan does. The temporary cure for Stan's cynicism is alcohol, which Stan takes to see the old world. Finally happy again, Stan observes the old world, watches a movie, then sees Kyle to attempt to reestablish and save their friendship. Kyle coldly tells Stan they need to move on, angering a drunken Stan, who gives Kyle the finger, saying ""Fuck you, Kyle, you're a piece of shit!"" As Kyle dejectedly walks away, Stan says ""...Kyle, I love you."" Only to tell Kyle off again. Stan is later captured by a group of restaurant owners trying to shut [[Cartman Burger]] down. At sniper point, the group forces Stan to ask Kyle what the secret ingredient is. After an ensuing shoot out, Stan refuses anymore of the alcohol saying he would be happy with everything going forward. Stan was optimistic of a new life, new adventures, until Randy drives up, telling him everything worked out with his mom. Stan is seen stunned as Sharon and Randy move back in, and he shares a picnic with Wendy. The closing moments of the episode show everything has returned to normal, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman come in his room saying they going off to see ''Zookeeper 2: Zoo-Keepier''. Stan chases after them to watch it, but not before taking a sip of whiskey he hid in his room.

Randy is Stan's father. They generally have a good relationship, although Stan often gets annoyed by Randy's obsessiveness (this is especially true with the [[Pandemic|video camera]]), pushiness, and melodramatic antics. Randy also tends to be very naive, which exasperates Stan all the more. Like the rest of the family, the relationship was getting bad due to Randy videotaping everything the family did in ""[[Pandemic]]"" but Stan may have been indifferent due to the Peruvian flute bands. Stan also dislikes his father's stubbornness, alcoholism and general stupidity.

Outside of Randy's antics, Stan seems to enjoy being around his father. Randy taught Stan how to dance in ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"", and Randy went to extra measures to help Stan win in ""[[Pinewood Derby]]"", although the extra lengths of cheating may have simply been to defeat a rival family.

Randy seems to want to live his life through Stan to an extend, but also to prevent Stan from his failures. In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", Randy was enraged at Stan attempting to form a boy band, because he first hand had a taste of fame and failure from it. In ""[[Stanley's Cup]]"", Randy woke up from a nightmare of Stan missing the winning shot in his pee-wee hockey game, and was emotionally unstable at the end when Stan's team lost to the Red Wings.

Randy does seem to want to have a stronger relationship with Stan, in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"" he logs onto Stan's teamspeak during the battle with the nerd and asks to play with Stan and his friends, despite him being weaker than all of the 4th graders' characters. In ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", Randy sees the boys playing Guitar Hero, and thinking they like playing guitar, wants to teach them how to play the real instrument.

In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", Randy tries to bridge another gap by listening to Tween-wave, while this serves as a chance for him to live his failed dreams, he tries to share his passion for the music that Stan and his friends hear, but he cannot. At the end of the episode, Randy and Sharon separate, Randy talks to a gloomy-looking Stan, and he drives off, with their house in his side mirror.

Later in ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", towards the end of the episode when Stan was finally ready to accept change, Randy and Sharon reconciled, with everything going back to the way they used to be with the only exception of Stan still drinking alcohol which was not referenced again.

She is Stan's mother. His relationship with her is often more stable than that with Randy. However, she has told him that she considers his happiness and Shelley's happiness secondary to her own (yet this was likely a joke on parents breaking up, because Sharon has never demonstrated this behavior aside from in [[Clubhouses]]). She did freak out when Stan was missing in ""[[Pandemic]]"" (he had been arrested by the military), taking the arguments with Randy about the video camera to the next level. Stan's jacket is almost the same as [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]]'s shirt. Stan is very similar to Sharon in the way he is level headed, and it is likely that they have a good, loving relationship with each other.

She is his violent and abusive teenage sister. She frequently insults him by calling him and his friends turds and physically harms him. However, she refuses to let anyone else harm him, as seen in ""[[Pre-School]]"" when Stan asked for her advice on what to do about the bully [[Trent Boyett]]. After asking for her help, she seemed to genuinely listen to his problem. Also, Stan even stated at one point that she used to be somewhat nicer to him before she got her headgear installed. She sometimes is nice to Stan, but would later prefer to run him over with a lawnmower. However, she has not been violent to Stan since ""[[Over Logging]]"".

He is Stan's paternal grandfather. He is 102, confined to a wheelchair, and a tad senile. He continually addresses Stan as ""Billy"", and in occasionally asks Stan to kill him. It turns out that this is a family trait involving the men in the Marsh family, dating back at least a couple of generations. He is said to have had the same relationship with his own grandfather.

Stan has very little contact with his grandmother, due to the fact she is hospitalized with a debilitating illness and also separated from Grandpa Marsh. However, she is an avid [[Facebook]] user and often has her son Randy bully Stan into checking his Facebook in regards to messages and posts she sends him.

He is Stan's maternal uncle.

She is Stan's great-aunt on his mother's side of the family. She was first seen and killed in ""[[Spookyfish]]"".

Sparky is Stan's dog, who is a homosexual. He has had many gay relationships, to Stan's chagrin, including one with [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s dog, [[Rex]], in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"". Sparky made its second appearance in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", during which Stan played ""Red Rocket"" by masturbating Sparky. Its third appearance was in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", where its fur was used to make Butters look like a dog.

The goldfish Aunt Flo gave Stan, and who killed many people, including her and Kenny, and framed his owner, Stan for it. Sharon nearly went insane covering up these murders, in an effort to protect her ""precious, handsome little boy"".

Roy was Stan's stepdad. After Sharon ""divorces"" Randy in ""[[Clubhouses]]"", she immediately ""marries"" Roy (though it is actually more likely as presented from the timeline that his parents were starting out on a trial separation). Roy is shown to be extremely emotional, and possibly bi-polar, particularly whenever Stan attempts to speak. Where one moment he tried to be 'friendly' with Stan, he immediately begins screaming that Stan is ungrateful and does not let up on him. He seems obsessed with cutting firewood, forcing Stan to do it for an entire day. Sharon and Roy stayed together until Sharon reconciles with Randy in Stan's Clubhouse, and the two of them proceed to have sex. Roy meanwhile is held captive in a beartrap set by Stan. What happened to him afterward is unknown, but it can be assumed that he died while being hung from the beartrap.

Stan is one of the leaders of the male student population in South Park Elementary, and therefore is well acquainted with most of the students. He is one of the few characters that always gets along with the girls, and was voted third cutest by them in ""[[The List]]"". He is respected and liked by pretty much everyone. He also has gone out of his way to make peace with his fellow students, like when he tries to make things right with [[Tolkien Black]] after Randy says the N-word on ""Wheel of Fortune"" (thinking he would win money) in ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"".

[[File:StanNKyle2.JPG|thumb|left]]
Stan and Kyle have been great friends since the very beginning of the show. Stan seems to be the only character in the show who gets along with all of the main and background characters. They have been known to end up working together in certain adventures, such as in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", and are often dragged into the same circumstances due to this, such as in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"". Stan has saved Kyle's life on several occasions without hesitation, most notably in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", and has once stated that he does not want Kyle to die until he does. He nearly always defends Kyle when Cartman's hatred of him goes over the top, such as in ""[[Cartmanland]]"" and ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"". Stan often becomes anxious about Kyle when he is tricked by various scams or becomes immersed in his hatred of Cartman, bending over backwards to encourage or reassure Kyle, convince him otherwise, or to get him out of trouble.

They are frequently seen together, or talking to each other, even in the absence of Cartman or Kenny, making them rather like twins. Also, in the opening credits of the show, they sing the same lines together. However, their friendship has hit bumps in a number of episodes, such as ""[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]"", ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", and ""[[Truth and Advertising]]"". They have reconciled on-screen in all of these episodes, with the exceptions of ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", and ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", although all those times they were shown to be friends in the next episode. ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"" focuses more than any other on their friendship, as a big argument between the two forms the major conflict of the story. However, in the end they reconcile, with no lasting damage done to the friendship.

Stan also had a great deal of concern when Kyle was voted the ugliest boy in the class in ""[[The List]]"". Their friendship is so strong that Cartman calls them ""fags"" and has even commented, ""You wanna get a room so you can make out for a while?"" in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"". It is also notable that in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"", Kyle was the only person who could hear Stan's voice in his head when Stan was trapped in Imaginationland though it was most likely due the shock he got from the portal.

Even though Stan does not really consider Cartman a friend, the two are often seen together. In ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"", Stan and Cartman hang out at the boating rack, and Cartman even comments that it is great that they are hanging out with each other without Kyle, implying that Cartman at least would prefer to have a closer friendship with Stan. Stan meanwhile seems to be more accepting or at least tolerant of Cartman than Kyle and even Kenny at times, such as in ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"". While Kyle is immediately distrustful of Cartman's truthfulness in his claim that he cannot control the actions of his hand (which has seemed to take on a life of its own), Stan gives Cartman the benefit of the doubt and admits that, with all the stuff that happens in South Park, Cartman could be telling the truth.

In ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"", Cartman made Stan the protagonist of his Christmas story (he is described as 'the boy in a red poof-ball hat'), showing that Cartman sees Stan as a heroic figure of sorts. In ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", Stan votes for Cartman's mascot instead of Kyle's, much to Kyle's dismay. Also, in ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"", when Stan appears to be the only boy who has not gotten their period, Cartman reassures him that he will get it one day.

In ""[[Fun with Veal]]"", when Stan was hospitalized with 'vaginitis', Cartman seemed concerned and was relieved that Stan was saved just in time. This is a rare occasion when Cartman has put his friends in front of his own personal gain, as he helped Stan stop people from eating veal even though he did not get anything in return for it and would be starving himself for days. He also tells the FBI negotiator that ""There's a sick kid up here"" (referring to Stan) when negotiating to release the calves, showing that he is worried about Stan's health.

It is implied that in ""[[Prehistoric Ice Man]] that Stan considers Cartman his second best friend. When Stan and Kyle fell out in the episode, Stan claimed that his new best friend was Cartman (as did Kyle), but they both claimed that 'Cartman sucks as a best friend' when they made up. This could be because Stan really values his best friendship with Kyle. Either way, it is clear that Stan does consider Cartman as a close friend. Also in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Cartman wants to kick Kyle and Tweek out of the group but does not want to kick out Stan, which implies that Cartman likes having Stan as a friend.

However, in ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"", Cartman declares that he hates Stan because Stan loves animals. Even so, In ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"", all three boys de-friend Stan after he becomes the leader of Scientology. As the boys leave, Cartman turns to Stan and says, ""I still hate Kyle more than you"". The two can also be said to be friends because they admitted to ""being friends"" in front of the home school kids.

In some episodes Stan is shown having a strong hatred for Cartman, even if Cartman is not doing anything. In ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"" when the cyborg says he has to kill Cartman, Stan asks if he can do it, and prepares to shoot Cartman before the cyborg decides against the idea. Although Stan is much more tolerant of Cartman than Kyle is, he often holds Cartman in very high contempt for his unacceptable behavior. In ""[[Sexual Healing]]"", Stan and Cartman were seen playing [[List of Video Game References#Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11|Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11]] together, hinting that despite Cartman's behaviors, Stan still considers him a ""friend"". However, in ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", when Mr. Mackey claimed that Cartman killed himself for being fat when the school faculty ""threw him under the bus"", Stan was more concerned with keeping [[Eavesdropper]] from posting its ""biggest story"" than with any injuries Cartman may have suffered.

Although Kenny and Stan do not seem to share the same bond that Stan and Kyle do, Stan sees Kenny as a close friend. In ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", out of the 3 boys, Stan has the hardest time dealing with Kenny dying, and cannot even bear to see him in the hospital. When Stan finally realizes that Kenny passed on ""for good"", he feels like he is Kenny's worst friend (until they hear about Cartman's selfishness). The two boys often hang out with one another when Cartman and Kyle get into their arguments and Stan and Kenny do not want to listen to it, such as in ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"". In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", Stan and Kyle fight against Cartman to not have Kenny's feeding tube removed to save Kenny's life.

However, in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"", when all hope seems lost to save Kyle and Stan breaks down crying in front of Kenny because of Kyle's impending death, he does not seem to care or even acknowledge the fact that Kenny dies all the time. This angers Kenny and makes him leave Stan to go home - which in turn causes his death by walking under a falling piano, and even then Stan still fails to notice or care.

During the first five seasons, Stan would almost always be the first to react in horror by saying, ""Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"", after one of Kenny's classic deaths. Of course, immediately after, Kyle would say ""You Bastards!"" and he would not acknowledge Kenny again after that. The only times that Stan would treat Kenny's death with immediate unconcern was when he was preoccupied with something important such as in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", and ""[[Gnomes]]"". In ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", both Stan, Kyle, and even [[Gerald Broflovski]], show a complete lack of horror or concern for Kenny's death after he eats dozens of anti-acid tablets and drinks water at which point he explodes. Instead all of them laugh and clap, finding that particular death ""a good one"".

In ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", Kenny as Mysterion tries to convince Stan and Kyle about the truth of his deaths and that they never remember, even to the point of shooting himself to prove it. Much to Mysterion's dismay, this does not work as no one who sees it remembers.

[[File:WendyandStankissing.jpg|thumb]][[File:Stanandwendy.jpg|thumb]]
A recurring topic in the early seasons was Stan's relationship with Wendy Testaburger. Her first appearance in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" shows Stan going on a date with her. A running gag in the early seasons of their relationship showed Stan vomiting out of nervousness whenever she tried to say anything to him or kiss him. Stan is the first of the four main boys seen getting his first kiss during a flashback in ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"", but not the first to actually do so.

Wendy dumps Stan for Tolkien in ""[[Raisins]]"", which drives Stan into a state of depression and even causes him to briefly join a local goth clique. After this, the two spent two seasons barely on speaking terms and rarely saw each other eye-to-eye. However, the two still had feelings for each other lingering in the air, as seen in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", in which Stan worries about getting paired with Wendy on a school project and is jealous when she ends up paired with Kyle. However, at the end of ""[[The List]]"", the [[Season Eleven]] finale, the two both work together to expose the secret corruption of Wendy's school list-making society and ultimately reconcile at the end, in a near copy of the end scene of ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"": Wendy is about to kiss him, when he vomits in her face. This was the last time he threw up on her, even when she kissed him a few times later in the series.

Their reconciliation was confirmed in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, ""[[Super Fun Time]]"", in which they pair up at their school field trip by holding hands, refusing to let go for a long time, and Stan confirms Wendy is once again his girlfriend. In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", he is concerned about Wendy fighting Cartman but feels that he could not do anything about it. However, he cheers her on when she beats him up. ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"" concerns Stan's efforts not to lose Wendy to a popular boy at school called [[Bridon Guermo]] by singing songs based on the style from High School Musical, despite Wendy's reassurance that she will not leave him and that the whole school likes Bridon. Wendy also kisses Stan on his cheek when she closes her locker and leaves, and Stan does not throw up. It is shown however in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"", that after the second time they resumed their relationship, she does not plan on letting him go for any other girl. She even goes so far as to judge him by his [[Facebook]] account rather than him in real life should she see his status say single and or see any other girls' comments on his Facebook page.

In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", she becomes increasing concerned about Stan's cynicism, and tries to talk Kyle into talking with Stan about it, but he refuses. Both Stan and Wendy are shown at the end of the episode sitting on a picnic blanket, presumably reconciling their relationship once again.

In ""[[Go Fund Yourself]]"", Stan breaks up with Wendy due to him starting a start-up company with Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]. However, they get back together at the end of [[Gluten Free Ebola|the next episode]].

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", Wendy breaks up with Stan due to the actions of internet troll [[Skankhunt42]]; all of the girls stated that his actions spoke for the boys' opinions.

In ""[[Oh, Jeez]]"", Stan is seen in a restaurant with Wendy, promising her he will change. Bill Cosby points out that if he is only changing to get her back, then he is being selfish. Stan tells Wendy not to give up on boys because ""I miss, you Wendy."" Before Wendy can respond, Butters berates Stan, calling him a traitor and ruins the moment.

Cartman attempted to prank [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] by pretending to be a robot made from [[Japan]], then revealing his identity. Butters said if Cartman pranks him again he would show everyone an embarrassing video of him pretending to be [[Britney Spears]] while dancing with a [[Justin Timberlake]] cardboard cutout.

Cartman, therefore, went to all lengths to protect his identity, even going to [[Los Angeles]] to visit Butters' [[Nellie Stotch|aunt]] with Butters. A.W.E.S.O.M.-O excused himself to the bathroom, where he took off his mask and proceeded to wipe his sweaty face and eat toothpaste because Butters would not leave his side and said that robots do not need to eat. Eventually, movie producers took A.W.E.S.O.M.-O and made him come up with films.

Cartman, as A.W.E.S.O.M.-O, came up with 2,884 films (over 800 of which star [[Adam Sandler]]). The military then kidnapped him, trying to use him as a weapon, but the scientist protected him. Butters comes in at an attempt to save his robot because he considered A.W.E.S.O.M.-O his best friend. The military felt sympathy for Butters and A.W.E.S.O.M.-O at the last moment, which Cartman ruined by farting. He tried to cover it up by saying its a ""sequence"" because Butters knew that robots are not supposed to fart and got suspicious. Butters lifts up the mask and carries out his promise of showing the video of Cartman dressed as Britney Spears to the whole class.

Abraham Lincoln,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln,,"was the 16th President of the [[United States]] who first appeared in the [[Season Nine]] episode, ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"". 
Abraham Lincoln can be seen wearing a black top hat, a white, button-up undershirt, a black suit, gray pants, and a black bowtie. He has a gray beard and an overall ""wrinkly"" appearance. It was believed, but not yet medically proven, that he had Marfan Syndrome, which causes problems with posture, and as such contributed to an awkward personal appearance.

He appears to children in need of motivation, he appeared to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in ""[[The List]]"", trying to convince him that being ugly is a good thing, and he then tries to motivate Kyle to work, and not burn down the school, hinting at a particular excess of compassion. With these facts, we can assume he is, morally, a good person. While originally maintaining this calm and compassionate demeanor, he was quick to call Kyle a ""fucking asshole"" when Kyle refused to listen to his advice. With these facts, we can assume Abraham Lincoln is a compassionate person but can have his limits for patience when people refuse to heed his lessons. However, it is also possible that this version of Lincoln is based on Kyle's personal view of him.

He was shown to care about Kyle's wellbeing in ""[[The List]]"", trying to convince him that being ugly was a good thing because he wouldn't be handed things, and therefore, would have to work, which would allow Kyle to excel in life. He uses the example of one of Jamal, [[the Ugly Kids]], by taking Kyle to Jamal's residence. Abraham tells Kyle that Jamal is well aware that because he is an ugly kid, no one is going to stack the deck in his favor. Peeping inside the window, Kyle saw Jamal playing the piano, to which Abraham Lincoln pointed out that Jamal practices long and hard at this, which will one day likely pay off. Kyle continued to wallow in self-pity; Abraham got fed up with this (since his job was to teach a lesson and he did his job), called Kyle a ""fucking asshole"", and then drove off.

Adolf Hitler,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Adolf_Hitler,,"was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalist Socialist German Worker's Party) and Chancellor of Germany from 1933 until 1945, and also acquired the powers of the president of Germany in 1934. He is notable in ''[[South Park]]'' for being among the idols of [[Eric Cartman]], who tries to emulate his strong speaking style as well as his efforts to exterminate the Jewish people. He first appears briefly in the [[Season One]] episode ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"".

When Cartman is suggesting he will be famous in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", [[Wendy Testaburger]] makes a brief, but degrading, comment that Hitler was famous as well.

He was first seen in Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat ride. The same model as is seen in the video in ""[[Pinkeye]]"" but in color and is pictured next to a republican and a christian, behind a gay person with the word ""RELAX"" on their T-Shirt.

In ""[[Pinkeye]]"", Cartman dresses as Hitler for Halloween, with a costume made by [[Liane Cartman|his mother]]. He wasn't aware of Hitler's real self until [[Principal Victoria]] showed him a video of Hitler, during which he begins emulating his speech patterns, beginning his idolization that later became a focal point of his characterization in later seasons.

Hitler next appeared as a resident of Hell in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', harassing [[Kenny McCormick]] upon his entrance. He appears similarly in ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"", sadly singing ""[[O Tannenbaum]]"" and lamenting his love of Christmas, resulting in [[Satan]] throwing a Christmas party in Hell and giving Hitler a Christmas tree of his own. He can still be seen there briefly in ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"".

He does not appear in ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]""; however, Cartman dresses like him when he leads his followers on a march through the streets of the town.

Hitler briefly appears dressed as the ""Can You Hear Me Now?"" Verizon spokesperson at Satan's party in the episode ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"", getting in the way of Satan's big arrival. Unlike many of his earlier appearances, in which his head was a photo of the real Hitler, he is completely animated in this episode.

Hitler is was shown in a black suit in ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"". In ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"", he was shown in a Halloween costume wearing glasses, light gray pants, and a dark gray jacket with South Park's version of the Verizon logo in the left shoulder area.

He is most notable within the series for trying to alert people of [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]], though he also appears once during his vice presidency, and reappears later to sue the town.

Al Gore originally wore a generic black suit with a thin face and black hair.  In [[Season Ten]], his new look included dark brown hair, a blueish gray shirt, and a brown tie. He later began wearing a red cape. In [[Season Twenty-Two]], his look has changed again, with his hair color now gray and having grown a matching beard. He also wears his blueish gray shirt, dark pants, and bowling shoes.

Gore appears to be very delusional and deranged, which is shown most when he apparently invents the [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]] creature and puts [[The Boys|the boys]]' lives in danger to maintain that fantasy. This might be due to an obsessive need for everyone to admire him as per Stan's description, ""You just use ManBearPig to get attention for yourself because you're a loser!"". This indicates that Gore has an extreme case of egocentricity as his attention-seeking idée fixe has poisoned his mind to the point that he undisputedly believes in the reality of ManBearPig.

Gore apparently made up ManBearPig and made it seem real (as far as he thought), so that the world would consider him a hero for ""destroying"" it, which is all he cares about. His mental creation manifested itself among the other evil characters of Imaginationland and he was willing to destroy Imaginationland along with all of its inhabitants to kill ManBearPig. Believing himself a super-hero of sorts, after donning his cape he began running around acting and talking like Superman. However, ManBearPig was proven to be real in ""[[Time To Get Cereal]]"" where it goes on a rampage in South Park.

Stan forced the rest of the boys to help Al Gore search for ManBearPig. While the rest of the boys did not care how Al Gore felt, Stan pitied him, leading to Al Gore taking them and then abandoning them in the [[Cave of the Winds]], nearly killing them by causing a cave-in and flooded the place, all in order to finally be rid of ManBearPig.  Because of this, all four boys now dislike him. When he gave a speech for the boys at their ""memorial"" at the Cave, he did not even know their names, and just referred to them as ""Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and Kid 4"". Infuriated with his delusions that almost got them killed, Stan yelled at him, calling him a ""loser"".

Al Gore appears behind a tree next to the Bijou Theater, where he asks Douchebag to put out ManBearPig trackers in various places. After that, he spams your page with status updates, he comes to the conclusion that Douchebag is ManBearPig himself and you must fight him to unfriend him. His first attack is using a slideshow presentation to make your character sleepy, and he summons bodyguards to protect him. After he is beaten, he starts terrorizing the church as ManBearPig. After you beat him, he can be found lying unconscious at the church. At the end of the game, after Douchebag leaves the scene, he reappears as ManBearPig hiding behind the tree.

Continued from ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] used the $3,000 won from [[America's Stupidest Home Videos]] to hire genetic scientist [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]] in order to test the DNA of everyone in town. This test would have, hopefully, revealed who Cartman's father was. An assassin, who later is revealed to be Dr. Mephesto's brother, shot Dr. Mephesto before the secret was revealed.

The America's Most Wanted television show came to do a re-enactment of the shooting and hired several actors, to try to solve the mystery of who Dr. Mephesto's assailant could be. With the help of public participation, using a 1-800 number, they hoped to gather clues and evidence from the show's viewers.

When the power was knocked out at the studio, and the group of people were snowed in, the civilians and America's Most Wanted employees began to cannibalize each other to stay alive. In the end, only [[Jimbo Kern]], [[Ned Gerblansky]], [[Herbert Garrison]], [[Mayor McDaniels]], [[Officer Barbrady]], the camera man, and the boom mike holder from the America's Most Wanted team, come out of the studio, leaving the actors' fates unknown.

All of the real people tried out for parts to play themselves only to be replaced by local actors for the roles of Dr. Mephesto, [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]], [[Officer Barbrady]], and well known actor, [[Eric Roberts]] to portray Dr. Mephesto's mutant clone assistant, [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto#Kevin Mephesto|Kevin]].

The actors are dressed in similar attire to Mr. Garrison, Dr. Mephesto, Chef, Mr. Hat, and Kevin. Rather than being proportional in stature and weight to the actual characters, such as with Mr. Hat and Kevin, the actors are all fully grown adults with average weight.

Annie Knitts,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Annie_Knitts,,"and '''Annie Faulk''', is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth-grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears as a background character in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"". She receives her first speaking role in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"". She was originally voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]], then [[Mona Marshall]] took over that role in later episodes. However, Annie is now voiced by [[April Stewart]].

Annie is one of the popular girls in the fourth grade at South Park Elementary. She is friends with girls such as [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Red McArthur|Red]], [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]], [[Nelly]], [[Jenny Simons|Jenny]], and [[Lola]], along with most of the other fourth-grade girls.

Annie has appeared in the show since the very beginning, being among the many characters to debut in construction paper design. Although she appeared in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s class in every episode where the third grade classroom was seen, she was initially a background character used to fill in classroom, cafeteria, or playground scenes and student gatherings. The first time she was directly acknowledged was in [[Season Two]] in the episode ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"", where [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] demands more backup players on his dodgeball team and requests her and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to join. This is also the first time where Annie makes any noise, as she lets out a whiny scream upon getting hit by a dodgeball.

She would not get her first speaking role until [[Season Three]], with the episode ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"". She went five seasons without speaking again until ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", where she receives more substantial dialogue by participating in the trend of emulating [[Paris Hilton]] and outcasts Wendy for her failed attempts at dressing like a whore. Ever since, Annie has been a prominent member of the fourth grade girls' clique, although she sometimes takes a backseat to other girls in episodes focusing on them.

While Annie has yet to have an episode individually focusing on her, she makes a fairly big impact to the story in the [[Season Twenty]] episode ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", where she encourages the other girls to break up with their boyfriends, believing they share [[Skankhunt42]]'s sexist beliefs.

Her current name was first heard in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", when she was at the [[Stupid Spoiled Whore (Location)|Stupid Spoiled Whore store]] with [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Red McArthur|Red]], and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. Prior to that, she was referred to as ""Jordan"" in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"", though many background characters at the time were frequently called by different names; however, Annie's name has been referred to in storyboards by its present form since Season 1, making this an error on the writers' part. Despite the finalization of her first name, she was called ""Ashley"" in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", but her first name seemed to have gone back to its current one in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, ""[[The Hobbit]]"".

Her surname has changed a lot throughout the series; it was revealed as ""Faulk"" in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", but in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, ""[[The Hobbit]]"", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] refers to her as ""Annie Nelson"". However, her other surname, ""Knitts"", was finalized in the video game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', though she was once again referred to as ""Annie Nelson"" in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

She wears a brown collarless jacket and black pants. Her hair is short, light blonde and tight-curly. In ""[[The Hobbit]]"", [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] states that Annie's hair is also thin. In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", she wore an aquamarine tube top, a teal-and-aquamarine wrap skirt, and white shoes while dressing as a whore.

She wears a pink pajama shirt with a light purple collar when she goes to bed, as shown in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"".
Annie is portrayed as a kind and friendly person; however, this leads to her being a target for bullying. In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', she is seen crying because three older girls took her [[Justin Bieber]] doll.

Annie is also rather naïve and innocent minded, admitting that she did not know what a queef was in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", while Wendy and the other girls did. Despite her shortcomings, she showed a trait of leadership and convinced Wendy and the rest of the girls to break up with their boyfriends in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"" in an attempt to prove a point about [[Skankhunt42]]'s misdeeds.

[[File:Mrs. Polk.JPG|thumb|right|Annie's mother, Mrs. Knitts.]]
[[Mrs. Knitts|Annie's mother]] was seen with her at the ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore (Location)|Stupid Spoiled Whore]]"" store, buying her things and waiting in line to check out. She had a speaking role, criticizing [[Mr. Testaburger]] for not letting his daughter buy anything in that store.

Her mother is also seen at the parents' meeting in ""[[T.M.I.]]"" sitting with her father; while he is not actually visible, her mother is seen looking off-screen towards someone, in the same manner the other parents look towards each other.

In the toy shop in ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"", Annie is seen trying to get the attention of an unnamed female relative as she holds up a candy cane, convincing her to buy it for her.

Annie is usually seen with the other girls, such as [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], and [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]]. She is seen mostly with [[Red McArthur|Red]], though.

While she is depicted as being part of Wendy's group along with Red, Bebe, Heidi, and Nichole, Annie tends to take a backseat to other characters at some points, such as [[Esther]] and [[Millie Larsen]] in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Red and Heidi in ""[[Marjorine]]"", and [[Lola]] and Red in ""[[The List]]"". She was seen in class, but not shown at Heidi's slumber party in ""[[Marjorine]]"".

Annie and Tolkien were often seen together in a friendly way in the early seasons. They were seen sitting next to each other on the bus in ""[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]"" and ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"" and chatting in class in ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"". They were also seen playing together on the swing set in ""[[Clubhouses]]"" and holding hands while singing ""[[It's Easy, Mmm'kay]]"" in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

In the recent seasons, they are not seen together as often, but they can be seen molding clay together in art class in ""[[Toilet Paper]]"".

Annie joined Butters' kissing company in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", and they seemed to be on good terms throughout the episode.

However, she can be heard in the crowd of girls encouraging [[Nelly]] to fight Butters in ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"", showing that Annie disapproves of Butters' decision to start the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out]] movement along with the rest of the girls.

[[File:SkankHunt00036.png|thumb|Annie breaking up with Daniel toward the end of ""[[Skank Hunt]]"".]]
In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", Annie is revealed to have had a boyfriend, [[Daniel Tanner]], with whom she breaks up towards the end of the episode.

Annie has a somewhat major role in this game. In her first appearance, she is seen being bullied by [[Bully Girls|three older girls]] by taking her [[Justin Bieber]] doll. After [[The New Kid]] fights the bullies, Annie befriends him. When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] asks Douchebag to recruit the girls, he finds Annie and she takes him to the girls' hideout by blindfolding him. During the siege on [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s fortress, she is dressed as a fairy. She also uses her fairy costume as her picture on Facebook, even before the New Kid recruits the girls.

Baahir has olive skin and curly, black hair, that is shaved around the sides. He wears a sky-blue, button-up shirt and dark gray trousers.
He was portrayed as nice and slightly over-trusting, even befriending [[Butters Stotch]] and going to his house, despite only knowing Butters for a few hours.

Baahir's parents, [[Mr. Hakeem]] and [[Mrs. Hakeem]], were kidnapped by Cartman when he was trying to find out the location of their son. He then tortured them by farting in their faces. When they refused to respond, professing that they did not know where Baahir was, Cartman then injected his arm with a syringe full of apple juice, warning them that apple juice gives him ""super bad farts"". He left them tied up and imprisoned after he found out that Baahir was at Butters' house. Due to their abominable experiences in South Park, the Hakeems moved away at the end of the episode. Cartman rejoiced at this, saying that not only did his bigotry save the country from the real terrorist attacks, but it also got rid of the Muslim family.

Immediately after moving to South Park, he makes a fast relationship with Butters and, after he is forced to move away by his parents, Butters is the only person who is visibly disappointed.

When Baahir first moved to [[South Park]], Cartman immediately suspected him of being a terrorist, presumably because of his race and religion. Cartman went so far as to ask [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] to have Baahir checked for bombs. It turned out that Baahir was not a terrorist, although Cartman's bigoted behavior towards him contributed to saving America from a real terrorist attack, which was going underway at the time.

* '''Fruit Bat''' - The one that Jimbo sent you to kill, can be summoned by placing the blood orange on the pile of poop near the cave entrance next to the theatre, it is much stronger than any of the other bats, but is pretty easy to kill since it is fought by itself as opposed to the other bats who are fought in groups.

* '''Guano Bombing Run''' - Craps on you or your buddy, deals high damage and grossed out if not blocked.
* '''Sonic Recuperation''' - A blast of sonar hits the bat, regains almost all of its health, for some reason the smaller bats can do this to.

Later that night [[the boys]] steal the calves in protest so they do not get slaughtered. They keep the calves in Stan's room for a week while the police try and reason with the boys to return Bob's property.

Starving and dehydrated, the parents send a gift basket which includes meat. Stan refuses to eat claiming he wants to be a vegetarian. He begins to break out with sores all over his body which according to [[Eric Cartman]], is caused by not eating meat, and not eating meat will turn him into a ""[[Vaginitis|giant pussy]]"".

Eventually the [[Channel 4 News]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and Hippies show up at the house turning it into a media circus.

Due to the work of negotiator [[Glen Dumont]] and actor [[Michael Dorn]], the baby cows were then sent back to the farm, however, due to the definition of veal being changed to ""tortured baby cow"", the market for veal quickly declined. This led to the rancher allowing the cows to mature before they would be slaughtered.

The calves vary in color, from black and white to brown. They all share the distinct feature of large, sad eyes with highly-visible, black eyelashes.

They were unable to accomplish this task. Instead, Randy tells Stan to stab Baby Fark McGeezax with the shank in the neck. Stan reluctantly complied, and stabs Baby Fark McGeezax, presumably killing him.

The space outlaw was revealed to be an ambassador to new world testing, named Kevern Zaksor and the entire chain of events was a test to see if Earth was worthy of joining the intergalactic community, known as the [[Federation of Planets]].

He tested humanity by giving them space cash and seeing if they would return it to the aliens. They failed miserably and spent it all until Kevern revealed that space cash is only worth what the humans decided it was worth. He berated the humans for their evident stupidity. As punishment for not returning the aforementioned space cash, the Earth is isolated from the rest of the Universe forever.

Kevern's most notable features are his pink skin and the two appendages sticking upwards from his forehead. He also has a small tuft of black hair between those two appendages. He wears a long-sleeve shirt with blue trim, as well as blue shoulder pads. He carries a revolver style laser gun.

While initially appearing as a stereotypical criminal, he is later revealed as the Ambassador to New Planet Testing. He is quite mean, ridiculing the humans for their low intelligence. His mannerisms and speech as Baby Fark McGeezax are modeled after 1940s actor James Cagney.

Barack Obama,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Barack_Obama,,"is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the [[United States]] from 2009 to 2017, and was the first African-American to hold the office. He was succeeded by President [[Herbert Garrison]] following the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

He is a member of a professional thief organization. He and [[John McCain]] are both in this organization and both ran for presidency. If either won, they would have gained access to the presidential escape tunnel. This would allow them to execute an intricate plot to steal the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institute. They succeed in their efforts and fake their deaths, with the help of [[Ike Broflovski]]. They then planned to travel to an exotic island to live out the remainder of their lives. Obama, however, decides to actually give the presidency a chance along with [[Michelle Obama]].

President Obama is one of the lead members in the elaborate conspiracy to justify the actions of rich, successful men, who have been caught cheating on their spouses. He notes that the men were under the control of a [[Wizard Alien]], causing them to be addicted to sex.

When [[Kyle Broflovski]] suggests that they need to learn to control their impulses, he and [[Butters Stotch]] are taken to the alien at Independence Hall. Once there, Barack Obama urges the boys to kill the alien, who in reality was a soldier wearing a costume. After the soldier is killed, Obama gives a speech reassuring others that if a rich, successful man is caught cheating, it would be because of a Wizard Alien.

President Obama told the public that [[Funnybot (Character)|Funnybot]] had planned an attack against the United States, using its and Russia's missiles. He stated that he would spend his last few hours on earth watching ""Madea"" movies with his family. He stated that he was embarrassed, but he could not help it.

General Tso makes a deal with [[Eric Cartman]], which was that if Cartman steals the ballots and gives them to General Tso at [[Red Lobster]], then Cartman would get a role in the next ''Star Wars'' film. However, the deal is postponed due to [[Kyle Broflovski]] and others trying to stop Cartman. Cartman hides the ballots at a Hummer dealership. In the end, to protect the ''Star Wars'' franchise, everyone decides to burn the ballots, guaranteeing Obama a second term in office.

Barack Obama is African-American with short black hair, a long face, a large nose with a small mole and black eyebrows. He also has unusually shaped lips and wears a dark blue suit with a tie. In some appearances, his skin is slightly darker.
Embodying a 'gentleman thief' archetype, Obama is depicted with natural charm as well as good manners and courteousness, using distraction and manipulation rather than violence or intimidation to achieve criminal ends. He is outgoing and confident in interactions with his staff and close allies. He is willing to resort to complex manipulation, inventing the '[[Wizard Alien]]' as an excuse for the various rich men having sex with many women, and he has ballots stolen to preserve his re-election as President.

Barbra Streisand,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Barbra_Streisand,,"is a hardly-known singer and actress whose nose is large enough to land stealth bombers on. She appears as the primary antagonist of the episode ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"" and returns in ""[[200]]"", ""[[201]]"", and ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"".

She is known to be [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]]'s most hated celebrity. They are quoted as saying, ""A lot of our fans ask us 'Do you really hate the celebrities you make fun of in South Park?' And the answer is, of course not. It's all just in good fun... except when it comes to Barbra Streisand. We hate her.""

In ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"", [[Eric Cartman]] steals a strange triangle-like object from [[Pip Pirrip]] while on a school field trip. Deciding it was worthless, he tossed it aside, only for [[Kyle Broflovski]] to claim ownership of it, at which point it was discovered that the triangle was in truth a rare archeological find called the [[Diamond of Pantheos#The Triangle of Zinthar|Triangle of Zinthar]]. News of the discover goes public, drawing the attention of the musical diva, Barbra Streisand, who realizes it to be the second half to the ""The [[Diamond of Pantheos]]"". The diamond was broken into two separate triangles and hidden at different points of the Earth, but Streisand has already found the other half of the diamond: the Triangle of Krewluck during the shooting of My Fair Lady. The other piece happens to be the triangle Cartman found, and if Streisand were to get her hands on that triangle she would become the most evil and dangerous creature to ever walk the Earth— Mecha-Streisand.

Streisand rushes to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] and makes several attempts to get the Triangle from Kyle and later Cartman (who regained ownership of the Triangle). In the end she tortures the boys with her terrible singing, which horrifies the boys, and causes Cartman to give up his prized possession rather than listen to her tortuous voice much longer. Joining the triangles together, the triangles begin to shoot beams of energy in all directions while Streisand begins chanting in Japanese. After one of the beams of energy strikes her, she is then merged with the diamond and transforms into Mecha-Streisand, proceeding to wreak havoc in South Park. She is however defeated by [[Leonard Maltin]], [[Sidney Poitier]], and [[Robert Smith]], all of whom take the forms of Japanese movie monsters.

Streisand remained a constant character of fear and loathing in South Park. In ""[[Spookyfish]]"", [[Comedy Central]] ran an ad campaign during the time leading up to the broadcast of the Halloween episode, stating that it would air in ""Spooky Vision"" - something so terrifying that it could not even be described. As the episode was introduced, it was revealed that this horror was in fact a photo of Barbra Streisand repeated in the four corners of the television frame. Streisand's face was also used for scene transitions in the episode. Each act of the episode featured a different photo.

In ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"", Cartman holds up a series of signs to show that [[Osama bin Laden]] is crazy, including ""Screw Ball"", ""Jackass"", and an image of Barbra Streisand foreshadowing Parker and Stone's hatred to her.

Streisand appears again as Mecha-Streisand in ""[[200]]"", but with a completely new CGI appearance. After her destruction she was somehow salvaged by [[Rob Reiner]] and [[Tom Cruise]], who located and rebuilt the Diamond of Pantheos to revive her, being activated in the episode's climax. In ""[[201]]"" she rampaged though South Park and destroyed a few buildings, killing [[Pip Pirrip]] and others. The Super Best Friends tried to fight her but none of their tactics worked, not even removing the triangles. However, [[Jesus Christ]] came up with a plan with help from [[Moses]], getting [[Krishna]] to morph into [[Neil Diamond]] and perform a duet with her where they were able to pacify her. What became of her after this is unknown.

Barbra Streisand has a very unusual look, she has a large amount of messy dirty blond hair that goes up to her shoulders, small eyes a little pale, a wide mouth with pink lipstick, a big and unusually large nose and a double chin. She wears a black button-down tank top with a pink collar, dark blue pants and black shoes.

In her Robotic form she has large thick eyebrows and is made of white and gray pieces, the shape she is drawn is reminiscent of Godzilla.

In her appearance in ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"" she was completely redesigned, her hair was lighter and her body is made of gray, black and red pieces, her syrup was attached to her neck, her right arm had a large saw and her eyes were red while her pupils were yellow.
In ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"", It is revealed that Streisand's ""mother was a Jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman"" and that she is an ""evil, egotistical diabolical bitch"" who wants to conquer the world with the relic.

He wears a red shirt, as well as blue denim shorts and blue sneakers. Although he resembles his original character, some differences in the clothing's color scheme are still visible.

In ""[[The Problem with a Poo]]"", Bart had a very similar appearance to the original character, having a new body shape reminiscent of the Simpsons cartoon style. The few changes made include green shorts, red tennis shoes, and his hair appearing to be slightly combed.

On ''The Simpsons'', Bart is usually portrayed as mischievous, rebellious, and cunning, but with a good heart. On ''South Park'', he is portrayed similarly, but maybe somewhat worse-intentioned and destructive, as he stated that he could do terrorism. Additionally, Bart later helped Cartman with said terrorism by knocking out the good-intentioned Kyle with his skateboard, then helped keep him trapped. However, Kyle does seemingly convince him to free him so he can stop Cartman by telling him something about becoming as bad as he is, likely indicating more moral responsibility. He also seems to strongly dislike ''Family Guy''.

Bartender,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Bartender,,"As of ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"", his character began to make recurring appearances throughout the episodes as the owner of the [[Skeeter's Wine Bar|main bar]], until he was reduced to a background redneck after [[Season Seven]], including being replaced by [[Skeeter]] as the owner and bartender at the local [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] bar.

In his first appearances in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"" and in ""[[Damien]]"", he is seen working at [[Sports Book]] as a bookie. His first appearance as a bartender was in ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"", where he serves a drink to [[Mr. Mackey]] with the intention of making him feel better.

The character's most notable appearance was in ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"", where he is first seen serving [[Peetie the Sexual Harassment Panda|Peetie]] at the bar before [[Skeeter|one of his patrons]] starts an argument against him. Throughout the episode, he is seen trying to calm his patrons after they start an argument multiple times, satirizing the common cliché from films and television originating from many westerns.

In ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"", he appears prominently among the various supporters of the war.

In ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"" he is seen among several [[Townsfolk|South Park residents]] angry at the arrival of the rich people in town, and forbids them from entering his bar.

In ""[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]"", he kicks [[The Boys|the boys]] out of the bar, who were trying to watch the trailer for [[Terrance and Phillip]]'s new movie on television.

In ""[[Butt Out]]"", he explains to [[Rob Reiner]] about it being legal to smoke in bars in Colorado.

The character was reduced to a background redneck after [[Season Seven]], including being replaced by Skeeter. He has since started making background appearances with other rednecks in later episodes.

He finally plays another notable role in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", where he tells other citizens about Snooki's presence in his bar. A possible script or animation error names him Skeeter in this episode.

He, along with other old characters, makes a cameo in the opening of Current Seasons, where he can be seen next to the Bar with other rednecks.

The bartender has blond hair tied in a ponytail and a goatee. He has a pencil propped up in one of his ears and wears a blue coat with a pen in one of the pockets, as well as a brown belt with purple pants and black boots. He is notable for having longer legs than most other adults, similar to [[Bill Denkins|Farmer Bill]].

In ""[[W.T.F.]]"", he got a complete character redesign, now having a pair of visible front pockets and white buttons on his coat, as well as less contrasting colors on his clothes and an all-new face shape with his hair now having sideburns.

Since his bar's most frequent patrons were generally close-minded and uninviting, the Bartender typically served as the straight man to them, regularly attempting to water down their hostility towards whoever they ""didn't take kindly"". The bartender is easy-going and relaxed. He is authoritative when it comes to keeping his customers under control, and tranquil.


[[File:Bartender friend icon.png|thumb|The Bartender's profile picture icon on Facebook.]]
The Bartender can be found at the bar along with [[Skeeter]] and can be added as a friend on [[Facebook]] after the New Kid completes the quest [[Rats in the Cellar]].

His character's first name, ""Dave"", was revealed in ""[[Britney's New Look]]"", where his mother offers him a camera to take a picture of [[Britney Spears]] with the crowd.

He finally played a major role in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', with his name changed to ""Bartles"", where he appears as one of the first bosses the player has to defeat.

Bartles is a medium-sized 6th grader with spiky brown hair. He wears a blue shirt with orange stripes and blue jeans.

While on the way to [[Tucker Residence|Super Craig's house]], [[The New Kid]] will encounter Bartles bullying [[Peter Mullen]] and intervenes.

She seems to be the ""popular"" girls' secondary leader, after [[Wendy Testaburger]], in the [[The 4th Grade|fourth grade]], though Bebe serves as the primary female throughout Seasons Five to Eleven. She briefly became part of [[The Boys|the boys]]' group in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", but only because of her early developed breasts.

At the end of ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", she is seen at Wendy's party relaxing next to the latter, implying she had something to do with [[Ms. Ellen]]'s kidnapping and subsequent execution by launching into the sun.
*'''Attempted Murder:''' In ""[[The List]]"", Bebe tried to kill Wendy, but the bullet misses and as a result, ends up killing Kenny instead.

[[File:Bebegun.png|left|thumb|Bebe with a pistol, in ""[[The List]]"".]]
In ""[[The List]]"", it appears that she knows how to handle, load, and fire a handgun when she attempted to kill [[Wendy Testaburger]]. She ended up killing [[Kenny McCormick]] with her handgun in her fight with Wendy. She accidentally pulled the trigger and Kenny was hit by the stray bullet. She also killed Kenny with a boomerang in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"".

In the episode ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", it is revealed that Bebe is part of the cheerleading squad.

Bebe has committed several crimes, as seen in some episodes. This is seen here:
[[File:Bebeboobs.jpg|left|120px|Bebe with breasts.]]
In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", she became the first of the fourth-grade students to reach puberty, as she began developing breasts in that episode. Though they were tiny (she originally thought they were mosquito bites, until she saw that they were not healing), they caused the male students to go ape-like in their desires for her. Bebe liked the extra attention they gave her until this happened, and though she was rejected by the surgeon for getting breast reductions, she successfully broke the spell over the boys by wearing a box to school to hide her chest. After this episode, she appears normal as she was before, and her boobs were not shown nor mentioned again; her chest was also devoid of the cardboard box afterward.

Bebe has long, frizzy golden blonde hair, parted to her left side. While her hair hangs down to about her right elbow, she was seen in ""[[Informative Murder Porn]]"" with some of it draped over her left shoulder. It was mentioned by Wendy in ""[[The Hobbit]]"" that she has acne. She wears a red jacket with light gray trim and dark green pants with light gray mittens on her hands. Underneath her jacket, she has been shown to wear a red sweater. In ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", she was seen wearing a green jacket, tan pants, and dark blue mittens, while in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", her jacket and mittens were pink, with her jacket being a darker shade than her mittens. She also wore the aforementioned outfit in ""[[Pinkeye]]"". In the episode ""[[Chickenlover]]"", she was briefly shown wearing a blue jacket in a scene.

Bebe wears a short-sleeved, ankle-length, pink nightgown with white trimming around the cuffs and collar at bedtime, as shown in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", ""[[Marjorine]]"", and ""[[Pajama Day]]"". When she dressed up as a whore in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", she wears a fluffy white shawl, a fluffy white bustier, and a short red miniskirt with a white buckle with a star in the middle of it. She also wore pink hair extensions, eyeliner, and blush. Bebe was also seen wearing a heavy amount of makeup in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"".

In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', after joining the boys, she wears a dark-green headband, a blue cape, two yellow plates on her breasts, and a brown belt with a silver buckle. She also has a braid in her hair tied to the thread of her headband and carries a spear.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Bebe is seen as an adult woman. She has a white shirt, a buttoned-up red trenchcoat with the words ""Mary May"" where her right breast is, a navy-blue skirt, black high heels, and a white, black, and gold ascot. She also has heavy makeup, lavender earrings, and her hair is more curled.
Bebe is usually a friendly and flirty person and is seen hanging out with other characters, mainly the other girls in school. However, she has had rocky relations with the boy students.

In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", she attracted unwanted attention from the boys and wanted them to appreciate her for her intelligence and aspirations rather than superficial traits such as her breasts.

Bebe also has an interest in makeup and fashion. In ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", Bebe helped makeover Wendy so that she could impress Stan again, and she was shown wearing a heavy amount of makeup for her school photo in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"". In ""The Fractured But Whole"", Bebe helps New Kid with his outfit, commenting on how he need help with it. If New Kid wears one of her costume designs, she excitedly takes a selfie with him.

Bebe is very much a trend follower, unlike her best friend Wendy. She jumped on the bandwagon of being a stupid spoiled whore when Paris Hilton came to town and joined everybody in the new photoshop craze, where she photoshopped her picture to the point where it did not look much like her at all. This could imply she has some insecurities about her appearance, as she was also the first to snap back when Wendy commented on the other girls' flaws in ""[[The Hobbit]]"".

She can be emotional, crying over Heidi Turner quitting Twitter in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"". She is also shown to have a quick temper. Despite being generally nice, she has a mean streak and can be quite tactless. This is shown when she made fun of Heidi for dating Eric Cartman in ""[[Doubling Down]]"", which upset Heidi and caused her to go back to him at the end of the episode. She also made fun of Marjorine in ""Marjorine"", but felt guilty about that soon after and helped give Marjorine a makeover.

Bebe also has a Machiavellian personality; in ""[[The List]]"", she, Lola, Jenny Simons, and (to an extent) Red, had altered a list their Sunshine Community made rating the 4th-grade boys based on how cute they are. In that sense, Bebe betrayed over half the 4th grade class for shoes. The list placed Kyle Broflovski at the bottom, destroying his self-esteem, driving him psychotic, to the point of attempting to burn down the school. When Stan teamed up with Wendy to investigate the list and confronted Kyle with the results, Bebe pulled out a gun. The police showed up and Wendy attacked Bebe. While struggling, Bebe accidentally pulled the trigger on Wendy, however, she missed, instead, hitting and killing Kenny through a wall while he was eating dinner with his family.

[[File:MrsStevens.jpg|thumb|133px|Bebe's Mother.]]
[[Mrs. Stevens|Her mother]] is a stereotypical, large-chested, dumb blonde, who got by in her earlier years by relying on her looks. Bebe does not want to end up like her mother; she would rather be a lawyer or a marine biologist. However, she does seem more interested in make-up, partying, and dating than her friend Wendy. Mrs. Stevens is occasionally seen in crowd scenes including, ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", and various others. She also tried comforting Bebe in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"" by telling her that she was smart and that is why boys liked her, although they were attracted to her budding breasts. When Bebe hears her boobs conspiring, Mrs. Stevens shows unexpected awareness of the nature of breasts stating they feed off the misery of boys.

[[File:MrStevens.jpg|thumb|left|133px|Bebe's dad.]]
Bebe's dad was first seen in a family photograph in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"" at the 'Spoiled Whore Party', but his first speaking appearance was when he told Bebe at the end of the episode that she would go back to dressing and acting like a proper young lady. He has also been seen at the end of ""[[Britney's New Look]]"" and at the meeting in ""[[Major Boobage]]"" as a background character.

In ""[[Major Boobage]]"", she is shown to have a snow-white cat. The cat's name was revealed to be ""Thumper"" in the episode ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"".

[[File:FollowThatEgg20.jpg|thumb|150px|Bebe and Wendy in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"".]]
She is Wendy Testaburger's best friend, helping Wendy in situations such as getting Stan Marsh back from his substitute teacher, [[Ms. Ellen]], in the episode ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"". Despite this, she abandons Wendy in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"" because she is not enough of a stupid spoiled whore. But Wendy had abandoned her in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"" anyway because she was jealous of the attention the boys gave Bebe. One interesting tidbit is that she and Wendy are on different sides in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"": Bebe is on Cartman's side and Wendy is on Stan and Kyle's side.
[[File:Wendy bebe picture.png|thumb|Picture of Wendy and Bebe in ""[[The Hobbit]]"".]]
In ""[[The List]]"", she turned on Wendy at the end, with a gun, and almost killed her. After accidentally shooting Kenny, Bebe was arrested. It is unknown whether their friendship is as close as it used to be; Bebe was seen paired with [[Lola]] in the mid-season 12 finale ""[[Super Fun Time]]"". However, in the episode ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", it is shown that Wendy and Bebe are still friends, showing that they had made up since then.

During ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Bebe is shown watching the film ''[[Asses of Fire|Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire]]'' despite Wendy's refusal to. It should be noted that though Wendy had a major role in the movie, Bebe was not shown being supportive of her or interacting with her in any way, as she was given very little dialogue.

[[File:Kyle-and-Bebe-bebe-stevens-31870923-250-161.jpeg|thumb|Bebe and Kyle Broflovski]]
Bebe has always shown interest in Kyle, even though Kyle does not seem to reciprocate.

In ""[[Clubhouses]]"", Bebe fell in love with [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] because of his ""fine ass"", and tried to pursue a relationship with him, which he did not even realize was happening. She even kissed him while playing Truth or Dare, after which he ran off screaming. She immediately broke up with him, Kyle not even realizing they were going out, claiming that he was too co-dependent and that it was over between them. She immediately went off to be with Clyde.

But in the episode ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Kyle and the other boys notice that there is something unusually attractive about Bebe all of a sudden. Later, while the boys are hurling rocks at cars with her, Kyle tries to show her a better way to throw her rocks after being jealous of Clyde showing her, though his interest in her was only due to her new-developed breasts, which the boys outgrew due to her showing up to class with a cardboard box over her chest a few days later. Also, in the episode ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", Kyle gets paired with Wendy, while Stan gets paired with Bebe. After seeing Stan treat the egg without care, she states: ""I wish I had a partner like Kyle.""

[[File:ClybePair-1-.png|thumb|Bebe with Clyde]]
After Bebe lost interest in Kyle, she eventually started dating going out with Clyde in ""[[Clubhouses]]"". This relationship was not looked into any further, but when Kyle tried to teach her how to throw rocks at cars in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Clyde was the only one who tried to intervene, and he was concerned that Kyle was getting in the way of the relationship. Bebe was also walking with Clyde in ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"" and was the lone girl in the group going [[South Park Church|to confession]] after they saw a nude woman on the internet. In the [[Season Eleven]] finale, ""[[The List]]"", Bebe was not against voting Kyle as the ugliest and voting Clyde the cutest. The reason given was that all the girls wanted discounts while shoe-shopping. As a result, she eventually started dating him again, albeit only to get free shoes from him.

[[File:FollowThatEgg14.jpg|thumb|150px|Stan and Bebe, in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"".]]
Bebe has not been seen interacting with Stan but she has been seen as a sort of messenger between him and Wendy, as shown in ""[[Raisins]]"", where she told Stan that Wendy was breaking up with him. Later on in the episode, Stan sought her for advice on how to win back Wendy.

In the episode ""[[Clubhouses]]"", Bebe dares Stan to jam a stick up his peehole.

Bebe also worked with Stan on a school project in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"" but he showed anger towards her because he was mad at Kyle for being with Wendy. Bebe then became disgusted with him. Despite that, she and the rest of the girls voted him the third cutest boy in class in ""[[The List]]"", helps him capture Wikileaks in ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", encouraged him to sing in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", and sang Happy Birthday to him in ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]''.

[[File:Bebe 1.png|thumb]]
[[File:1000px-CartbePair-1-.jpg|thumb|Cartman and Bebe playing Silence of the Lambs]]
While Bebe and Cartman have been seeing playing and getting on well whilst roleplaying ''Silence of the Lambs'' in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", she has been seen encouraging Wendy to ""Kick the shit out of him"" in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", and flipped him the bird after killing him while playing ''Call of Duty'' in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"". Cartman later ""pwns"" Bebe in the game and calls her out because of it. However, in ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", Cartman makes a music video with the girls pretending to like his music. He chose Bebe and [[Red]] out of all the other girls to hug and rub all over him during his music video. In addition, Cartman invited Bebe to his birthday party in ""[[Damien]]"" and she handed him a present.

Bebe and Butters do not seem to like each other. Butters calls her a ""dumb girl"" after she calls the boys ""assholes"" in ""[[Raisins]]"". When Butters becomes a pimp in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"" he tells Bebe to make some ""real motherfuckin' money"", which annoys her.

Despite this, however, Butters was one of the boys that liked hanging out with her in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", though it was only because of her early-developed breasts. Bebe and Butters are seen sitting next to each other on a table while singing ""[[It's Easy, Mmm'kay]]"" in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Bebe is one of the people smiling at Butters while he walks down the hallway after becoming a celebrity in ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"".

As of [[Season Twenty]], Bebe seems to have gone back to hating Butters, as she becomes dissatisfied with him forming the Wieners Out movement and can be seen in the crowd of girls encouraging [[Nelly]] to fight Butters in ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"".

Bebe is shown to be friends with Heidi, having been constantly seen in her and Wendy's group of friends, and being invited to her sleepover in ""[[Marjorine]]"". However, she vomits after seeing that she and Cartman are in a relationship in ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"".

Bebe appears as an unlockable character.

Bebe plays no role in the game's storyline and is one of the 'additional characters' unlocked at the game's completion. She is in the same medic-type class as [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Timmy Burch]], and [[Tweek Tweak]], moving quickly but doing minimal damage. Her unique special ability causes her to automatically collect all coins on the screen without moving to catch them - it works well with [[Kenny McCormick]]'s power for enemies to drop coins without dying.

Bebe and most of the other girls do not make appearances until the third day. The New Kid has to pose as Bebe's boyfriend so the girls can find out who's a [[Heidi Turner|two-faced bitch]] amongst them. Bebe also thinks that Douchebag is hot, as he does not talk much.

Belarusian Farmers,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Belarusian_Farmers,,"were a group of protesters and farmers fighting the Belarusian government to keep their land from being developed. They appeared in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, ""[[A Scause For Applause]]"".

[[Stan Marsh]] teams up with [[Jesus Christ]] to help the Belarus farmers keep their land and regain the people's faith. Jesus and Stan visit the [[P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory]] to find a new cause in which they can bring awareness to. They both decide nobody knows or cares about the farmers in the Eastern European country. While in Belarus, Jesus talks to a reporter about his cause but the Belarusian military murders all of the farmers before Jesus can do anything to save them.

When it is revealed to be a prank, the Thompsons and South Park Dairy search the world until they discover the Thompson's estranged son to be Ben Affleck. Mr. Garrison notes the similarities between the butt-faced parents and their actor son. In this episode, his face is shown to a photo-cut out of the real Ben Affleck.

Affleck appears again in ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", now voiced by [[Matt Stone]] and with a normally animated cartoon appearance. When a new singer going by the name the ""Jennifer Lopez"" replaces his then-girlfriend, the real [[Jennifer Lopez]], the couple fly to South Park, where Affleck foolishly fell deeply in love with ""[[Mitch Conner|Ms. Lopez]]"", who in truth was a crude imitation of Jennifer Lopez painted onto [[Eric Cartman]]'s hand in the vein of Senor Wences. Affleck and the hand proceed to share a whirlwind sexual romance (involving Cartman jerking off Affleck on multiple occasions, often without Cartman realizing it). However, when the real Lopez attempts to murder Cartman and the hand-Lopez, it is revealed that the new Jenny is a male con-artist named Mitch Conner, intent on pulling a job against everyone. Oblivious to what has transpired, Affleck is left heartbroken after Mitch ""dies"".

In the episode ""[[Wing]]"", he can be seen listening to [[Wing Han Tsang]] at [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s son's wedding.

Affleck and his ex-love Mitch Conner / Jennifer Lopez appear again in ""[[200]]"", as part of a group of celebrities intent on suing South Park, and also in stealing the anti-ridicule goo of the Muslim Prophet, [[Muhammad]].

In ""[[Going Native]]"", [[Butters Stotch]] expresses jealousy and rage at Affleck's relationship with Jennifer Lopez once again, only for a Hawaiian man to inform him that Affleck was now dating Jennifer Garner instead. Butters rage subsided and he said that Affleck did not have everything going for him after all.

Affleck wears a dark gray, short-sleeve, shirt, brown belt, blue pants, and yellow sunglasses. He also has black combed hair.

He may be unintelligent, believing that the [[Wizard Alien]] must be behind his abnormal sex drive. His goofy dialogue also hints at his low intelligence.

Benny,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Benny,,"is the bank teller at the [[Bank of South Park]], who appears in ""[[Margaritaville]]"".

In ""[[Margaritaville]]"", [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] go to the South Park Bank, so Stan can learn to save his money. Stan gives Benny $100 to save. Benny explains how insurance works before suddenly announcing ""It's gone"". The teller then tells him to move aside for people who actually have money. This happens with 2 people after.

Benny wears a black suit, a white shirt and a blue and white striped tie. He also has brown hair.

Benny is uncaring to his customers, when he loses their money, he does not offer any condolences, and simply pushes them aside.

When people approach Benny and ask him to put their money to work, Benny puts their money in high-risk ventures without asking them, getting signatures or giving any alternatives, which in real life would get him fired.

Benny is seen when [[The New Kid]] goes to the bank. He can invest money, but Benny then loses it instantly as he did in Margaritaville. Once you have the shrinking power, you can go through a well-hidden hole in the bank and fight the Bank Teller.

The New Kid, with [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], go to Benny at the bank to get a loan for the Chaos Minions. This time without even asking, Benny puts the New Kid's house up as collateral for the loan without asking or getting anything signed, and instantly loses it, to Professor Chaos' horror, again reflecting the scene in ""[[Margaritaville]]"".

A random Wheel of Fortune-style game then starts, similar to the scene in Margaritaville which shows how the economy works with a beheaded chicken. The New Kid can play this game as many times as they like. After the New Kid is of a sufficient economic class, you can take a selfie with Benny.

She has long black hair with parted bangs. She wears a light purple jacket (similar to [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s) and cream-orange pants. As a ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"", she wore a blue, pink, and white tube top, a short, hot pink skirt, and pink high heels. It is worthy to note that she looks extremely similar to [[Tammy Nelson]].
Because of her minor speaking role, little is known about her personality. In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", she was in the closet with Clyde for two minutes and judging from his reaction afterwards, we can assume she did something to him involving the anus and/or spanking. However, due to the fact that she was participating in the ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"" fad, no accurate personality traits can be assumed from this.

She is a part of Cartman's bounty hunter hall monitor group, which parodies ''Dog the Bounty Hunter'', but does not speak.

She is based on Beth Chapman, the wife of Dog. Chapman died from cancer in 2019.

Beth's body shape is similar to Cartman's. She appears to have defined eyebrows, her eyes are almost completely covered by her unusually massive breasts, which is unusual as she is a child. She has long blond hair and massive breasts covering half of her face. She wears a black shirt, gray pants, and a pink bra. She has short, stubby hands that rise above her head.

She does not have a distinguishable persona, as she has never had any speaking roles. It is implied that she is somewhat cruel, as she was not against bear macing people without a reason when ordered to. She may be somewhat intelligent, as she was able to track down [[Ms. Stevenson]]'s Travelocity account and her hotel room.

Betsy Donovan,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Betsy_Donovan,,"was [[Clyde Donovan]]'s mother and [[Roger Donovan]]'s wife. She was of Dutch ancestry and according to Clyde, she apparently had a very good recipe for lemon bars. She died in ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"" after Clyde left the toilet seat up. However, she was later seen alive in the episodes ""[[Jewpacabra]]"" and ""[[You're Not Yelping]]"", which is likely a continuity error.

Betsy was originally referred to as ""Martha"" in her non-speaking debut in the episode, ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"", but ten years later, this has been retconned and changed to Betsy, in ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"". Betsy was from a Dutch background and could even speak in its native tongue. She displayed her Dutch language and singing skills in the episode ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"" when she was singing a Dutch melody about [[Slash]] to Clyde over the phone.

[[File:ReverseCowgirl015.png|thumb|Betsy stuck in a toilet in ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]""]]
In ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"", it is revealed that Betsy was hard on Clyde when it comes to matters such as leaving the toilet seat up, even going to his school to confront him about it. Ultimately, Clyde failed to put the toilet seat down, resulting in her death. Betsy apologized to Clyde for not being harder on him and begs him to put the toilet seat down, for his sister's sake, before she asked to be allowed to die. Her death was caused by her organs being forcefully ripped from out of her rectum, due to pressure changes caused by closing the water valve, leaving [[Roger Donovan]], widowed, with Clyde and his [[Clyde's Sister|unnamed sister.]]

In all of her appearances, Betsy was voiced by [[April Stewart]], until her final appearance in ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"", where she was voiced by [[Trey Parker]] due to last-minute script changes.

She had dark brown hair, just like Clyde and her husband. She wore a long-sleeved white top with a light brown overdress, a red belt, a gold belt buckle, and pearl earrings.

Little was known about Betsy’s personality. Although she was mostly portrayed as a calm and kind woman often seen caring for her son Clyde and reminding him to do his chores and interacting with the other parents, She had no problem embarrassing her son in front of his friends, however. It was revealed in ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"" that she ""treated people with dignity and respect.""

Big Bad Government Guy,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Bad_Government_Guy,,"is a government official and the main antagonist in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

At first, not much is actually known about the Big Bad Government Guy, except for the fact that many years ago a UFO which crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. His government agency was formed in order to investigate the paranormal, and have never lost a fight until four years back when investigating a child who had an unnatural power inside of him. The agency attempted to secure the child so that they could harness the powers of making friends quickly on any social network.

When [[The New Kid|Douchebag]] escapes from the [[Visitors]] which causes it to crash land in South Park, he was called upon the government to contain the threat and claimed it to be opening up a new [[Taco Bell]]. He was later seen having a meeting with several other members of the government witnessing the effects of the goo from the ship turning any organic life into [[Nazi Zombies]]. In an attempt to neutralize the threat he plans to plant bombs across the city to destroy anything in a three block radius and cover it up as an effect of an earthquake.

He does not appear again later on until the end of the game where he and his soldiers surrounds Douchebag and the boys revealing the New Kid's purpose to them.

He appears as an elderly man with white hair and wrinkles around his face. He wears a black suit and tie and is always seen wearing a plain black eye patch on his right eye.

Big Bad Government Guy is a shady agent who works on behalf of the president for the good of the country. In spite of any patriotism he may feel, he views himself as merely a pawn of his own government, and secretly resents it. When he felt he had the power to control his own fate, he stripped naked and laughed manically, running to the top of the tree house with the [[Stick of Truth]].

Big Bad Government Guy is not hesitant to do what he feels is necessary to achieve his goals, from destroying a town of innocents to abducting children. In spite of his negative aspects, Big Bad Government Guy does have a sense of honor of sorts, being knowledgeable of ""The Gentleman's Oath"" and was genuinely surprised that the boys were willing to break it to defeat Kenny. He hates Nazi Zombies, considering them ""overused"".

It is possible that Big Bad Government Guy is not terribly intelligent, as he believed the boys' story about a common stick having the ability to control the universe. It is also possible that his past experience with the paranormal has made him more credulous than common sense would dictate, as other than his mistake with the Stick, he seems to run his secret government operation fairly well.

The other child it ate was the [[Boy with Red Shirt]]. This monster was once used to scare the [[The 4th Grade|4th Graders]] into behaving, making it a sort of bogeyman.

He temporarily adopted [[Sparky]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan Marsh's]] homosexual dog, who had run away from home after Stan had gotten upset with him. Stan then wanted Sparky back, and Big Gay Al agreed to return him, but only after explaining homosexuality to Stan. Later on in the episode, his large shelter transforms into a briefcase and flies away, but the various animals remain and are reclaimed by their owners, who had missed them very much.

He had a minor role in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', where it was revealed that he is in fact a celebrity. He was the co-host and an entertainer at the troops' USO show, in which he performed his own musical number, ""[[I'm Super]]"". His singing voice for the song was provided by [[Trey Parker]].

In ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", He later took up the position of scout master of troop 69, since he had been in the scouts since he was nine years old. However, the parents of the children were uneasy about a gay scout leader, and the club fired him. The boys, however, didn't like their new Scouts Leader, and rallied to get Al back, and Gloria Allred and others forced the Scouts to re-accept him. He rejected this, saying he knows the Scout leaders are still good men, and since the scouts are a private club, they should have the right to exclude people if they choose to, just as he has the right to express himself as a gay man.

He wears a pink Hawaiian shirt open at the top, exposing his left nipple, a blue neckerchief, and brown corduroy trousers. His skin is heavily tanned. Big Gay Al is thick set and has brown hair, eyelashes, a mustache, and very red lips.

He appears to be very compassionate about things he loves, saving homosexual animals in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"", being in the scouts since age nine in ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", and etc. It is shown in his debut that he smokes.

[[File:FollowThatEgg11.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. Slave and Al declare their engagement.]]
In ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", it was revealed that Big Gay Al had started up a relationship with [[Mr. Slave]], the ex-boyfriend of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] sometime after the other two men had broken up over the latter's sex change operation, and that Slave and Al had moved in together. Garrison, who had hoped to take Mr. Slave back, is enraged by the news and more so when Slave announces their engagement. Mrs. Garrison swears she will stop gay marriage from becoming legal so that she can have Mr. Slave back; when her effort fail, Al and Mr. Slave are married by [[Father Maxi]] in a major ceremony, with [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] and [[Randy Marsh]] among those in attendance.

In ""[[The F Word]]"", Mr. Slave and Big Gay Al are the first to see the boys' attempts at getting rid of the local Harley Riders, by writing ""Fags Get Out!"" Initially they are pained and horrified by the sign, until realizing that the boys did not mean anything disparaging against gays, but were instead using the term ""Fag"" in regards to the Harley Riders, stating ""You can be gay, and not a fag"". Al and Slave, finding agreement with this, help the boys to change the definition of ""faggot"" from a gay person to an annoying Harley rider, with Al presiding over meetings in town and brandishing a rifle against the Harley riders.

They often appear together at large gatherings, such as in ""[[The City Part of Town]]"" to see the [[Whole Foods Representative|Whole Foods representative]]'s arrival and in ""[[Bike Parade]]"" holding a barbecue during the bike parade and watching the kids.

[[File:CrippleFight066.png|thumb|right|Big Gay Al and Marc together.]]
When he hosted the USO Show in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Al was accompanied by a pianist named Marc who played the backing music for his new song ""[[I'm Super]]"" while Al sang and performed elaborate choreography involving dancers, costumes, and more.

The two appear to be close friends, as Al invited Marc over to play sad music while he packed away his things from his scouting career in ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", and afterward Marc played uplifting music when Al requested.

Big Gay Al is one of the unlockable multiplayer characters. In the mission ""A Clone of Your Own"", he is one of the templates for the deformed clones encountered by the boys (in fact, only Big Gay Al clones are fought in the first stage).

While Big Gay Al does not physically appear in the game, he can be added as Facebook friend by answering the cell phone in Mr. Slave's rectum.

Mr. Billings, wanting to maintain a fun and safe environment for the Easter egg hunt, decide to use Cartman as a sacrifice for it. Cartman is chained to a concrete block, forced to wear a bunny costume, and drenched with chicken blood.

Believing they sighted a three-foot-tall ""bunny man"", the researchers shoot Cartman with a tranquilizer gun. Having successfully sedated Cartman, they leave the park with the goal of having a show on Animal Planet using their dart gun as evidence.

Bill wears a blue shirt similar to [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' except with a white collar and pocket. He also wears black pants and matching gloves. His hair is similar to [[Terrance Mephesto]]'s, although it is brown and slightly shorter. He has thick eyebrows during the first four seasons, but was later redesigned and given regular ones.
Bill is a bully, often laughing at things and people. In addition, he thinks everything is gay. Due to his seeming stupidity, it appears he did not make it to the fourth grade - he is never seen in the fourth grade classroom, but is in the halls, and is only seen in the hallway and playground after the third season. His voice appears to sound almost the same as [[Fosse]]'s. He was seen again in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"" when the boys discovered he, along with Fosse, stole [[Sarah Peterson]]'s doll. He then played along and was ""shot"" in the game.

Bill seems to be one of the more naive children in the school along with Fosse, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Bradley Biggle|Bradley]], [[Jason White|Jason]], and [[DogPoo Petuski]]. In the episode ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", he was part of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s group to help capture and lock up [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. It seems that unlike most other kids, ([[Craig Tucker|Craig]], [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]) who are more aware of Cartman's manipulating methods, he still hasn't wised up to it and so that is why Cartman would most likely seek him out for help.

[[File:Damien058.png|thumb|Bill and Fosse's fathers.]]
Due to Bill's quick phasing out from the series, his family was never officially seen. In the episode ""[[Damien]]"", [[Mr. Allen|two older]] [[Mr. McDonald|men]] are seen in the bar after [[Jesus]] storms out, saying ""This show's gay"" followed by ""Yeah, gay"" in the similar style to Bill and Fosse, while also having the same face and clothes but adult bodies. In the commentary of the episode, it was revealed that these two characters were indeed Bill and Fosse's parents. Bill's dad actually has a line in ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"" where he is one of the parents that drives by and makes fun of [[Mr. Mackey]]. Bill can be seen in the episode ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"" with an adult woman who could be his mother.

Bill and Fosse are minor characters in the game. They participate in the attack on [[South Park Elementary]] and Clyde's fortress alongside the player. Both of them are seen being attacked by three elves, and they befriend the player after he saves them. Bill makes only one Facebook post, and it says ""You're gay!""

Bill can be found with Fosse at the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] bar. When interacted with, Fosse says, ""Sorry, you're not my type"" with regards to the player, Bill then responds with, ""Yeah, he's taken"", referring to Fosse. This could been seen as confirmation that Bill and Fosse are (somewhat ironically) in a relationship with one another; or it may simply be seen as the duo engaging in another example of their ""that's gay"" routine.

The New Kid can get a selfie with him if they have at least one active [[Class:Blaster|blaster]] ability.

In ""[[Chickenlover]]"", he reports another case on his farm to Barbrady, this time his chickens being molested, but the case ends quickly when Barbrady makes up an excuse not to read the letter the [[Book Mobile Driver|chicken lover]] had left, which ends up angering Denkins.

In ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"", he offers his barn to house the first [[Jakovasaurs|jakovasaur]] found after [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] is rejected by the [[Mayor McDaniels|Mayor]] to take care of it, and later attends the meeting at Jakov's new home.

During the [[Cow Days (Event)|Cow Days]] event in the [[Cow Days|eponymous episode]], he allows Cartman to train with his old bull Bob at his farm for carnival.

In ""[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]"", [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] go to his farm to buy a turkey for the Fourth Grade theater, and end up being given a disabled turkey by Timmy's decision, which he charges at a higher price, much to Kyle's annoyance.

In ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", He unknowingly participates in [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s plan to get revenge on [[Scott Tenorman]] by shooting his parents to death thinking they were trying to steal his pony. He was also among the guests at Cartman's chile party, claiming that he had the right to defend himself against invaders.

In his last featured appearance in ""[[Fun with Veal]]"", the [[The 4th Grade|fourth graders]] take a field trip to his farm and discover that the veal comes from the meat of baby calves, which he plans to send to market. The next day he finds out about the theft of the calves by [[The Boys|the boys]], who wanted to save them and so ended up locking themselves in [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s room for days. In the end, when he manages to get his calves back, he concludes that they are worthless since everyone found out about their meat being sold as veal, and so decides to set them free, much to the boys' happiness. He is called ""Rancher Bob"" during the field trip, implying that his middle name might be Robert.

He was neither captured nor mentioned by Scott in ""[[201]]"", despite being the literal killer of his parents. It is possible that Scott left him out as he knew he had been tricked by Cartman into committing the murder.

He, along with other old characters, makes a cameo in the opening of Current Seasons, where he can be seen tending his farm.

Denkins has light brown hair and mustache and looks slightly taller than most other adults. He wears a black cowboy hat with a white sash and wears a red jacket with blue buttons and front pockets, as well as a gray buckle belt, blue jeans and black boots.

Denkins, now called ""Rancher Bill"", appears in the side-quest ""[[Magical Songs]]"", where [[The Bard (Character)|The Bard]] asks him if he can buy the flute he has for sale. Denkins tells him that the flute is inside the barn with the ""[[Nazi Zombie Cows|crazy cattle]]"" and gives them the key to the barn after The Bard agrees to help him with them. Denkins is later grateful that The Bard and the New Kid managed to kill off the crazy cattle and gives Jimmy the flute for free. He cannot be added as a friend on Facebook.

Bill Donohue,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Bill_Donohue,,"When [[Pope Benedict XVI]] attempts to stop the [[Hare Club for Men]] from revealing the true origins of the Catholic Church, that [[Jesus Christ]]'s disciple and the first Pope, Peter, was in truth a rabbit, he gets the services of Bill Donhohue and the Catholic League to help him in his efforts. Their primary objective is revealed to take possession of a bunny named [[Snowball]], who is revealed to be the descendant of Saint Peter. However, the Pope slowly begins to realize that Donohue's efforts are rather extreme and not ""very Christian"" as he resorts to torture and murder members of the Hare Club in order to get what he personally wants, all the while claiming his actions are those demanded by God himself.

The Vatican then announces that it would be holding an Easter Vigil, and the Pope would supposedly show his 'divine grace' by feeding the poor with a giant rabbit stew. This however is revealed to be another extreme plot created by Donohue in which he plans to publicly murder the Hare Club for Men, who are still dressed like rabbits and feed them to the poor. [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]] arrive with Snowball, with the intent of trading him for the Hare Club members. Donohue however double-crosses them, taking the bunny and the boys hostage with the intent of murdering them as well, claiming that this would be what Jesus wanted. It is then, that Jesus enters, and advances upon them. He verifies that the story of St. Peter being a Rabbit is true, and that it should be made the new Pope.

Without skipping a beat, Donohue orders for them to Kill Jesus, to which the Pope decides that it is 'definitely' not Christian to kill Jesus. Stating that the Pope is weak and Jesus a blasphemer, Donohue overthrows Benedict as Pope, claiming that he alone can speak for God. Locking up the Jews, Kyle and Jesus, he plans to kill the Hare Club and run the church. Jesus however escapes the jail, by having Kyle kill him, allowing him to resurrect outside their cell. Jesus then proceeds to kill Donohue with the Glaive from ''Krull'', before he can kill Snowball and the Hair Club member after which he places Snowball on the Pope's throne.

He appears again in ""[[201]]"".

Bill Donohue, when he appeared in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", wears the typical attire for a Pope, which consists of a white robe, gold scarfs, a white Pope hat, and a crucifix. He can be seen wielding a long gold crucifix staff.

Donohue is a religious fanatic, going to extremely brutal and violent measures to prevent the truth about Easter being exposed, despite claiming to commit his wicked deeds in the name of God. He is evil, egotistical and power hungry, usurping even the Pope and desiring to see all those who oppose him tortured or destroyed, very much a parody of his overly righteous nature in real life.

He got himself and Butters in trouble by having a men's underwear catalog in his room. After Butters, not getting what he meant, said he 'like-liked' him, he admitted having ""bad thoughts"" about their friendship.

Bradley Biggle,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Bradley_Biggle,,"and '''Gok'zarah''', is one of [[The Boys|the boys]]' [[The 4th Grade|classmates]]. He is voiced by [[Matt Stone]] and first appeared in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"". He is portrayed as a background character until his first major appearance in the [[:Category:Superheroes Saga|Superheroes Saga]], beginning with ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"".

Bradley made his first appearance in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"" as part of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir, along with [[Kelly (""Rainforest Shmainforest"")|Kelly]], [[Jake]], [[Esther]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Millie Larsen]], [[Sally Turner|Sally]], a nameless black-haired boy, and two unnamed brunette girls. He later becomes a recurring background character in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"". Bradley's first speaking role was in ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"", where he sings ""I can make a Mr. Hankey, too!"" before pooping out [[Mr. Hankey]] from behind a bush.

During ""[[Fourth Grade]]"", he begins appearing in the classroom and since has remained a part of the recurring fourth-grade classroom with some omissions. He later appeared in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"" as one of the boys who reverted to an apeman-like state when attracted to [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] due to her developing boobs. He was partnered with Esther in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"" for the class project, was ranked #4 on the list of cutest boys in ""[[The List]]"" and played on the school's basketball team in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"".

He made his first significant appearance in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"" as the superhero [[Mintberry Crunch]] with his role continuing through the story arc's second part, ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" and he appears in the arc's conclusion, ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"" where he plays a crucial role. During the first two episodes, he is unable to say exactly what his power is - this was first brought up by [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]], who suggested that he add something to the costume; Bradley said ""Milk?"". He is left behind to ""guard the base"" when the others go to the hotel fire. Eventually, when everyone follows the disgraced Coon outside where [[Cthulhu]], who had risen and sided with the Coon over the course of the story, is waiting for them, he runs away and escapes exile to the Sunken City of R'Lyeh. [[Mysterion]] uses his power to escape, and Bradley follows Mysterion to where Cthulhu is massacring a [[Justin Bieber]] concert. A message then arrives from space for ""Gok'Zarah"", who turns out to be Bradley - it informs him that he, too, has a power and was sent to Earth as a result of his parents being missing. Bradley uses his newfound powers, over Mint and Berry, to defeat Cthulhu, close the rift between Earth and R'Lyeh, and incarcerate Cartman. He then leaves to track down his parents. However, in the beginning of the story none of the other Coon friends believed he had a superpower, and the revelation of his powers surprised everyone. Also, Bradley's last name was revealed in ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"" to be Biggle. Since then, he only made a few cameo appearances, all of them with his normal identity.

He is an alien who wears a human disguise with pale skin and blonde, bowl-cut hair, with a cow-lick sticking up at the back of his head. He also wears a navy blue sweater with red mittens and blue jeans.
Bradley seems to be bright and very active. He has his major appearances in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"". Until then, though, he usually only appeared as a background character. Bradley is the true identity of Mintberry Crunch, later identified as Gok'Zarah. As Mintberry Crunch, he was bullied by [[Eric Cartman|The Coon]] until he discovered his power, whereupon he put the Coon in a dog crate with [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]]. While he has had occasional speaking roles, he never really spoke until the Coon and Friends episodes.

Bradley also appears to possess a kind heart as can be seen in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"" where he tried to stop Coon from beating Mosquito and ended up getting scratched. Another example can be seen in ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"" where Bradley is the only one who tried to stop [[Mysterion]] from provoking Cthulhu and sacrificing himself in exchange for their friends.

Bradley was apparently adopted by the Biggles. However, he is actually an alien sent to Earth by his birth parents after the collision of the Mint and Berry worlds. Little is known about his real family other than their home planet's name was [[Kokujon]].

Bradley's mother has been shown to be very nice and caring for her children. It is unknown how or when she took Bradley in as her own child but this factor does not seem to cause any difficulties in their relationship. She tries to get her children to get along by asking her daughter Henrietta to spend some time with her brother, it seems that she is oblivious to Henrietta's disdain towards Bradley.

The relationship between Bradley and Henrietta is rocky to say the least. Henrietta finds her little brother to be an annoying twerp and Bradley, in return, is scared of her. Despite relying on her at times to keep him company, Bradley would like to gain the upper hand on his sister and he eventually did when he rubbed her face in it after discovering his powers. He returned to their home only to call her fat and flip her off, suggesting an utter dislike for her.

[[File:Bradly's Father.jpg|thumb|Bradley's real father.]]
Little is known about his birth father. However, when things got too dangerous for his son, an image of him appeared before Bradley to tell him about his origins (the planet K'oh Kajan) and powers. His appearance seems to be based on the singer Limahl, who was most famous for singing the theme to the 1984 movie adaptation of ''The NeverEnding Story''.

Bradley's sister Henrietta talked about her father and aunt when she was first introduced. From her description, we hear that Bradley's adopted father is an alcoholic and his aunt is a drug addict. This however may not be true as Henrietta seems to over-exaggerate or make false claims about her loved ones because she likes to see things negatively.

Bradley's alien father also states that his son also had an alien mother, however it is unknown what happened to her or if she is still alive.

Bradley often follows Cartman's schemes, such as capturing Kyle in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"". In the Coon and Friends episodes, Bradley annoys Cartman, who bullies Bradley in response, because of his Mintberry Costume. Cartman got annoyed of him saying phrases such as, ""Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor!"" Bradley is also scared of Cartman because he can easily beat him up; he got beaten up by Cartman in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"" when they were going to the grocery store. But in ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", at the end of the episode, Bradley defeated [[Cthulhu]] and put [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] in the same prison where [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] was incarcerated throughout the trilogy. He also realizes he has his own powers of Mint and Berry whenever he says ""Shabalogoo!"" In the beginning, Cartman did not seem to understand his powers either.

Bradley and Esther were paired up in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"". Bradley and Esther were also part of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"". It also seems that they could also be seen together in the background so it is possible that he and Esther are either a couple or very close friends.

A picture of Esther can be found in Bradley's room in the video game, ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', implying he has a possible romantic interest in her.

Bradley transforms into [[Mintberry Crunch]] by spinning around and invoking the magic word ''Shablagoo!! ''When asked by [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] what his powers were, he replied: ""The power of mint and berries, with a satisfying, tasty crunch!!"" He is later shown able to shower enemies with berries as well as mint. His other powers include flight, super-human strength to the point of easily dragging [[Cthulhu]] by a tentacle, generating a berry force field, and teleporting in a splash of berries.

Bradley appears in the game as a minor character, hiding in the bushes near [[Marsh Residence|Stan's house]] for the entire game. He can be friended when the New Kid uses gnome dust to get through the gap in the bush.


Mint-Berry Crunch appears as a playable character in the DLC section ""[[Bring the Crunch]]"".

He admits that Lorde lives a double life; when she is not singing, she is a talented fluvial geomorphologist at the US Geology Survey, who fills in for another [[Randy Marsh|part-time geologist]]. Connecting the dots, Brandon uncovers the true identity of Lorde, 45-year old Randy Marsh, and writes a tell-all article about it for ''SPIN''.

Bridon attends [[South Park Elementary]]. He gains great popularity due to his singing and dancing abilities. In fact, it is stated by [[Bebe Stevens]] that Bridon has seen ""High School Musical 3"" over 100 times, which apparently makes him a huge favorite among the girls, who all have a crush on him. The boys seem to like him equally as much, due to the fact that he is such a great singer. However, although he has great theatrical abilities, what he really wants is to play basketball as he later confesses to [[Stan Marsh]], who dislikes the musical craze and the attention that his girlfriend [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] shows Bridon.

Despite being popular and talented, his family life is obviously abusive. He has a crazed, effeminate, theater-obsessed [[Mr. Gueermo|father]] who forces him to sing and dance every moment of the day, even during normal conversations, and is appalled by the thought of him playing basketball. Whenever Bridon attempts to talk to his dad about quitting musical theater, his father would threaten to slap him (in a whiny and effeminate manner). His [[Mrs. Gueermo|mother]] meanwhile does what she can to protect Bridon, but usually bears the brunt of her husband's anger.

After Mr. Gueermo assaults not only the [[Mr. Garrett|basketball coach]] but also [[Mr. Mackey]] and two agents from Child Protective Services, and also with Stan's encouragement, Bridon finally plucks up the courage to attempt to run away from [[Gueermo Residence|home]]. However, his father attempts to stop him and proceeds to once again threaten Bridon with a slapping. Fed up with his father, Bridon stands up to him by punching him in the nose. Never having suffered such violence before, Mr. Gueermo is confused and horrified as he clutches his bleeding nose, and rushes to his wife's side. She, however, having never considered striking back against her husband, finally stands up for herself as well by punching Mr. Gueermo several additional times.

Bridon then joins the basketball team, where he proves to be one of the star players.

However, Mr. Gueermo soon discovers that he enjoys [[We Will Rock You|the cheering aspect]] of sports, possibly resulting in the reconciliation for the family.

Although their first meeting is confrontational, Randy and Sondheim later have a ""bro-down"" and gain respect for one another. Now officially ""bros"", the other writers eagerly help Randy make his play more subtle, renaming it to ''[[The Woman in White]]'' and removing all the outright mentions of blowjobs, instead of introducing more oral ""subtext"". It is not known whether the play was completed, as Randy left to interrupt a performance of ''Wicked'' in order to stop [[Shelly Marsh|his daughter]] from performing oral sex on [[Larry Feegan|her boyfriend]] before it was completed.

Butters is loosely based on [[Eric Stough]], an animation director/producer that works on the show.

In ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"", he took credit for ''[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]'', in reality [[The Boys|the boys]] wrote it. This may not be entirely Butters' fault though, as [[The Boys|the boys]] originally told him he wrote the book. He may have believed they were trying to mooch off of his success when they revealed that they had actually written the book.
*'''Pimping:''' Butters paid a stripper in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"" and started a kissing company in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"" which later had real prostitutes involved. However, these crimes were committed on plain stupidity and were unintentional. It is normal for people to pay strippers and that the purpose for the kissing company Butters made was to have women get paid for kissing men, which is a kids game and is not branded on Butters.
*'''Terrorism:''' As Professor Chaos, he, along with [[General Disarray]] (Dougie) and [[The Coon]] (Cartman), threatened to blow up a hospital if [[Mysterion]] did not unmask himself, albeit it was due to Cartman's manipulation. He joins the anti-[[China]] group with Cartman and holds up a restaurant, which results in him shooting three people in the crotch by accident.
*'''Blackmail''': In ""[[AWESOM-O]]"" Butters tells his [[A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000|AWESOM-O robot]] (Cartman) that he caught Cartman dressing up as Britney Spears and then dances with a [[Justin Timberlake]] cardboard standee and videotaped it. He told Cartman that if he bullied, pranked, double crossed, or got Butters grounded once more, then Butters would show the videotape to all of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. The motive Butters had for blackmailing Cartman was that Butters wanted revenge on Cartman for everything he did to Butters in the past.
*'''Car theft:''' In ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"", he helps Cartman steal a [[NASCAR]] and crash it, injuring Cartman and killing 11 others. However this crime was committed on Cartman's manipulation.
*'''Breaking and entering:''' He breaks into Cartman's house to try and bite him, when he thinks he is a vampire. He breaks into [[Jenkins]]'s ranch, with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman, to get the baby cows.
*'''Manslaughter:''' He helps Cartman freeze himself in ""[[Go God Go]]"" which kills Cartman. However, Cartman comes back in the future and goes back in time so to Butters it technically never happens, so it is not a crime. He accidentally kills a bunch of people on two separate occasions while tap-dancing due to his shoe flying off and causes a chain reaction of events which kill people and lead people to kill themselves, but the second time he does it everyone cheers and congratulates him. As a result of this, this crime is not branded on Butters and his criminal record. In ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"" he writes a book called ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]]'' which inspires someone to kill the [[Kardashians]] with a shotgun.
*'''Murder:''' In ""[[Sexual Healing]]"", he and Kyle are ordered by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] to shoot at a ""[[Wizard Alien|wizard alien]]"" who, unbeknown to them, is a soldier dressed up in an alien costume. However, this does not really count as a crime as they were forced by the authorities to kill the soldier and were tricked into thinking he was an alien.
*'''Piracy:''' He joins Cartman's Somalian pirate crew along with [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], [[Kevin]], and [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] in ""[[Fatbeard]]"" in which they steal a lot of money and weapons. However, the United States government ignores this crime and blames the Somalian pirates completely.
*'''War crimes:''' In ""[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]"", he joins Cartman's army of drunken Southerners as a messenger, although he did not ransack, rape, murder, or loot.
*'''Attempted armageddon:''' In ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", Butters hosted a video and informed the citizens of South Park, that he is going to flood the entire world with a garden hose. However, he only succeeded by flooding his backyard. This was easily foiled and stopped by the Water Department.
*'''Assault with a deadly weapon:''' Shoots a patron of [[P.F. Chang's]] and a police officer in the crotch while holding the patrons hostage with Cartman in ""[[The China Probrem]]"". They did not get in trouble and walked away after the police were too happy that [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] were convicted of the rape of Indiana Jones.
*'''Sexual assault:''' In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"" he ""poked"" at [[Paris Hilton]]'s vagina while she was passed out drunk. He did seem to know what he was doing was wrong, as evidenced by his shocked face when his parents walked in; however, he did not seem to realize what he was doing was sexual or illegal. Butters gets arrested in ""[[Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special]]"" for pinching a girl named [[Kelly-Ann Barlow]], whom he thought she was not wearing green articles for Saint Patrick's Day. Butters eventually learns that Kelly had been wearing green socks, and is labelled by the police force and the media as a sexual predator.
*'''Indecent exposure:''' In ""[[Safe Space]]"", Butters ran around the school and into the kindergarten while naked. In ""[[Wieners Out]]"", he exposes himself at a girls' volleyball game, and then leading the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out movement]], marching through the halls while exposing himself.
*'''False advertising:''' In ""[[Sarcastaball]]"", Butters distributes his new energy drink during the [[Sarcastaball (Sport)|Sarcastaball]] craze known as [[Butters' Creamy Goo]], which turned out to be his semen. This sports drink then gets distributed to a wider audience, which could cause some serious health problems for some people. However, Butters honestly did not know that he was distributing his own semen.
*'''Arson:''' Although not seen, Butters burns down the school gym in ""[[Gluten Free Ebola]]"" and as a result gets suspended for it.
*'''Civil unrest/rioting:''' Was seen rioting at the Nebraska Mall after finding out the Mr. Hankey was a fake in ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"". Participant in South Park Elementary gender war during ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"".
*'''Sedition:''' In the [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|movie]], he was a member of [[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]], a group with the goal of stopping the execution of [[Terrance and Phillip]] by the government, though he did it to save the world from [[Satan]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] so that can be justified.
*'''Voter fraud:''' In ""[[Obama Wins!]]"", Butters is shown to have some involvement in Cartman's conspiracy. After being cornered by Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Craig, Tolkien, Jimmy, and Timmy, he swallows a single almond M&M to prevent him from talking. He is later seen in the emergency room, with his face and cheeks swollen. He does eventually give the information after Kyle threatens to get his father involved. It is later revealed that Cartman realized Butters broke his promise of secrecy; so he visits him in the hospital. He informs Butters that the ballots are safe before feeding him another M&M, worsening his condition.

Butters has made appearances since ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", though initially as a background character. He gets his first speaking role in the [[Season Two]] episode, ""[[Clubhouses]]"". He later receives a speaking role in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

Butters was seen sporadically in seasons three through five, going from a social pariah in ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"" to mean-spirited bully in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"".

In ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", Butters was adopted by Stan Marsh, [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Eric Cartman]] as their fourth friend when Kenny McCormick died ""permanently"" at the end of the [[Season Five|fifth season]]. The writers had given Butters his own spotlight episode as the season five finale to prepare fans for Butters taking Kenny's place on the show. The episode, titled ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", gave Butters a complicated back story where his father was outed as being a closet bisexual and his mother attempted to drown her son Butters in a fit of madness. They all made up at the end of the episode and nothing came of it.

Butters found himself as the new fourth friend, being put down and treated like a total outcast by his new friends. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman all openly bullied Butters, telling him how he is not cool like Kenny. Cartman in particular took perverse pleasure in making Butters suffer, to the extent that, in ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", he pretended to be Butters on the phone and bad-mouthed his parents, just so he could watch them abusing him. Several instances show the boys having Butters dress up as Kenny or simply call him Kenny or Not-Kenny, possibly to cope with their loss.

Butters would remain on as the fourth member of the gang for four more episodes; two of the episodes continued the plot of Butters being abused but downplayed it and in the case of ""[[Freak Strike]]"", ending the episode just as Butters was about to be beaten (with Cartman being beaten up instead). Ultimately, in the sixth episode of season six, ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", Butters is expelled from the group for being ""too lame"" and adopts his super-villain alter ego ""[[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]]"" as a means to get revenge against the group and society for rejecting him. Butters would run around for several episodes as Professor Chaos, only to have no one care much about his plots since many of them had, though Butters did not realize it, already occurred on episodes of the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Butters would eventually reveal his secret identity of Professor Chaos to Stan, although he mistook it for Butters coming out of the closet.

Though not anymore a member of the main four's group, Butters was nevertheless kept as a prominent member of the boys' extended circle. Though he has returned, Kenny's role has declined to an extent due to lack of ideas for the character and Butters has taken on a more prominent role again. Despite their ill-treatment toward him, Butters stays loyal to his friends, perhaps in hopes that they will accept him. In a way, this has worked as recently there seems to have been some shift in the balance of friendship. The most obvious case of this being in ""[[Tsst]]"", where Butters is calmly playing along with Stan, Kyle and Kenny, with Cartman being much more alienated than usual, as well as in ""[[Casa Bonita]]"", where Kyle decides to take Butters with him on his birthday to Casa Bonita instead of Cartman, implying he likes Butters more than Cartman. It has been said that Kyle despises Cartman because of his cruel, sadistic and selfish attitudes, as well as his prejudice—especially towards the Jews.

Despite their history, Butters has recently taken on the role as Cartman's sidekick. Cartman often takes advantage of Butters' kindness and desire to be accepted in order to fulfill his schemes. Cartman hurts and betrays Butters quite often, however, Butters continues to trust him unconditionally. Despite this, Butters got even in ""[[AWESOM-O]]"", where he filmed Cartman dancing, dressed up as [[Britney Spears]], later showing it to [[South Park Elementary]]'s various students and faculty.

Butters is also a very famous celebrity in the nation of [[Mexico]]. In ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"", Butters accidentally strays from Cartman's house and almost gets run over by a car. He is then ""refuged"" in a house by a couple who thinks that Butters is a Mexican and is given the name ""Mantequilla"", which is Spanish for Butter. They make him into their personal slave and then dump him into an El Pollo Loco restaurant. Butters then goes with some Mexicans and crosses into Mexico where he becomes a symbol of patriotism to the Mexicans. Butters realizes his popularity in Mexico when he comes outside naked in front of hundreds of Mexicans. He realizes that every time he raises his arms, the Mexicans cheer with joy. Butters is then made a fugitive by Cartman but the [[U.S. Border Patrol|U.S Border Patrol]] lets Butters back in and win the game of [[Texans vs. Mexicans]]. He is allowed back into the [[United States|U.S]] and shows his popularity to the other boys. In addition, he did not get grounded by his parents for becoming famous in a foreign country despite being gone for more than 2 weeks.

Butters was initially referred to in scripts and storyboards as ""Puff Puff"" and ""Swanson"" - [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] refers to him by the latter name in the opening scene of the Season Two episode, ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"". Butters was renamed and properly introduced in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"", alongside [[Dougie]]. His nickname is based on that of ''South Park'' animation director [[Eric Stough]]'s.

[[Matt Stone]] has voiced the character ever since his speaking debut in ""[[Clubhouses]]"". When Butters spoke in the early episodes, however, his voice was dramatically different from the stuttering Southern accent he has now. His voice then changed to how it sounds today in the season three episode ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"".

Despite being sweet and naïve, Butters does have a criminal record. Most of his crimes and misdeeds were, however, due to Cartman's manipulation and therefore most of these crimes should be branded as ""unintentional"" or ""crime due to manipulation"". For the other crimes that were not under Cartman's manipulation, it is caused by Butters' naivety. However, as his alter-ego ""Professor Chaos"", he will attempt to commit crimes, however his antics are not taken seriously and his plans usually fail miserably. The crimes Butters committed are included but not limited to:

Butters has not shown signs of being very prone to illness (unlike Kyle, for example), but he does have a history of occasional health-related problems on the show.

In ""[[AWESOM-O]]"", he said that he had a condition that made it hard to control his sphincter, and because of this, he sometimes defecates in his pants and has to wear a diaper to school. Logically, this would be considered Butters' biggest health problem, but it has never been even remotely mentioned anywhere else in the show, except for one scene later on in the same episode. He has also said that he kept his sphincter problem (and the fact that he wears diapers to school) a secret from everyone, except his parents, his doctor(s) and Cartman, who he told without knowing it was him.

In ""[[Erection Day]]"", Butters is singing his ""[[I've Got Some Apples|apple song]]"" at the [[South Park Elementary Talent Show]], but when he forgets the words, he becomes very nervous and wets himself before running offstage; his accident is very obvious and visible when it happens. Of course, this would probably mean that his sphincter problem has been cured and he is wearing normal underwear. It is most likely, however, that the writers on the show either forgot about it or decided to ignore it outside of the one [[AWESOM-O|episode]] where it was mentioned.

In ""[[Obama Wins!]]"", Butters is shown to be severely allergic to almonds. After being cornered by Stan and Kyle, Butters ingests a single almond M&M to prevent him from having to disseminate any information. He is later seen in the hospital swollen, and unable to articulate speech.

In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny bought authentic Japanese weapons from a fair. Butters wants to play with them, but they do not allow him. Butters then transforms into Professor Chaos and has a ""ninja fight"" with the gang. This ends when Kenny accidentally throws a shuriken into Butters' eye, which causes him extreme pain, shocking the other boys. Luckily, Butters receives medical attention after the whole town sees him in shock. In later episodes his eye appears to be fine as if it never happened.

In ""[[Pre-School]]"", he finds out that a bully from pre-school got out of jail, and then tries to hide. His dad later kicks him out of the house in an effort to make him have fun, but he simply gets nervous and starts singing to himself. The bully arrives and gives him several stereotypical ""bully"" injuries, including a wedgie so massive it almost killed him, and two severe Indian sunburns.

In ""[[The List]]"", he hits [[Nelly]] between her legs in order to obtain the list she keeps away from the boys. He apparently gets beaten up for it afterwards, as in the next scene he is seen with a black eye and an arm in a sling.

In ""[[The Coon]]"" he is punched in the face during his fight with [[Mysterion]] as the Coon intervenes. He leaves the frame with a bloodied nose, also claiming a broken tooth.

In ""[[Butterballs]]"", he shows up in the cafeteria at lunchtime sporting a black eye. The kids think a school bully is responsible and suggest that he talk to his grandmother about it. However, it is revealed that she is the one who has been inflicting this pain on him.

In ""[[Safe Space]]"", he is forced to delete any bad comments about people that are posted on social media or get two weeks of detention. Butters eventually goes insane from sleep deprivation and being tormented by [[Reality]] and jumps out of the school window, causing him to have a head brace for the rest of [[Season Nineteen]]. These injuries appear to be gone by ""[[Member Berries]]"".

Butters openly joins and helps with some of Cartman's schemes, and is usually shown doing well at it. Butters is often depicted as being innocent, gullible, easily manipulated and stupid.

Butters is shown to be smart in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"" and highly talented, instantly supplying the correct answer to a complicated math problem as well as playing the drums. The context suggests this is a talent of Butters' that is well known to the others. (He also tutors Stan, at his request, in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"" — although it is not clear in which subject, possibly more than one).

However, in ""[[Go God Go]]"", he did not realize that Cartman may die if frozen in snow for several weeks - he had to get Dougie to inform him of these facts. Although, this may reflect his innocence; Butters may have thought that a person can survive being frozen due to [[Larry (""Prehistoric Ice Man"")|Steve]], real name Larry, from ""[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]"" being frozen in ice for thirty-two months and being revived completely healthy; this would give him good reason to believe that Cartman could survive being frozen for three weeks. In ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", Butters was able to hack into The JumboTron in Coors Field which shows he is proficient in I.T. In ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", Butters was shown with good negotiation skills.

As revealed in ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"", Butters is a very talented tap dancer, but his fondness for dancing was cut short at the National Tap Dancing Championship when a freak accident (caused by Butters' tap shoe flying off his foot) set off a chain reaction leading to the deaths of eleven people. This has left Butters quite scarred, although this is not immediately apparent. In the same episode he was further terrified as his tap shoe again started another fatal chain of events, leading to the death of [[The Orange County Crew|five rival dancers]] (and their [[The Orange County Crew Coach|instructor]]) who Butters and Stan were set to face in a dance contest.

He also seems to have some break-dancing ability, as seen in ""[[Asspen]]"". Additionally, Butters exhibits some impressive free-style dancing ability, dancing to [[Justin Timberlake]]'s ""[[Rock Your Body]]"" in ""[[Marjorine]]"". He showed off more dance moves at the end of ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"" during Satan's party, imitating [[Michael Jackson]].

Butters is often seen singing to himself, usually ""[[I've Got Some Apples]]"", a song that goes, ""Lu lu lu, I've got some apples / Lu lu lu, you've got some too."" He is often cut off at that point. When he does finish, the ending is, ""Lu lu lu, let's make some applesauce / Take off our clothes and lu lu lu."" or, ""Lu lu lu, let's get together / I know what we can do lu lu."", which, either way, could be a strange euphemism for sexual intercourse. In ""[[The China Probrem]]"" Butters sings, ""Lu lu lu I've got some splish splash/ Lu lu lu splish splashing more"". Making it seem that his song has changed, but this may be only because he was taking a bath while singing it. In ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", Butters is in the outfield in baseball and is seen singing a song that goes, ""I see a ladybug, hello little ladybug!"", he may have been watching a ladybug in the grass while singing. In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", Butters auditions for ""[[Fingerbang]]"" by singing ""[[Little Bunny Foo Foo]]"". In ""[[AWESOM-O]]"" he sings ""[[My Robot Friend]]"" about his robot friend that resembles the theme song of ""The Courtship of 'Eddie's Father"", and he seems fond of the Chicago ballad ""[[If You Leave Me Now]]"". Apparently, Butters can also play the drums quite proficiently; he is seen doing so for Cartman's Christian rock band [[Faith + 1]], featured in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"".

In ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"", in the flashback of the horrible accident Butters caused during the championship competition, the song Butters dances to is an upbeat, yet obviously risqué song entitled ""[[I've Got Something In My Front Pocket]]"", which features the lyrics, ""Won't you reach into my pocket and see what it is / Then grab onto it, just for you / Give it a little squeeze and say 'How do you do'.""

More recently, in ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", Butters is heard singing a song while using the urinal in the boy's bathroom: ""Hey there Mr. Weiner, whaddaya know / Do you need to tinkle tinkle? / Yes, I do think so"".

In ""[[Canada on Strike]]"", Butters preforms ""[[What, What In the Butt]]"", by Maxwell. The end result is him being called a homo.
In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", Butters sings Joni Mitchell's song ""[[Help Me]]"" while playing with his army figurines. We hear Butters singing from a tape recorder ''""Happy Trails To You"" ''in character as a big Texas singer in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"". Butters frequently sings the line from Chicago's ""[[If You Leave Me Now]]"" in ""[[Casa Bonita]]"".

In ""[[World War Zimmerman]]"", it is shown he can beatbox quite well.

In ""[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]"", Butters can be seen listening to a song from the Ring ""Jonas Brothers"" on MTV.

In ""[[Band in China]]"", Butters is a guitarist for Stan's band, [[Crimson Dawn]], with the other members being Stan as the lead singer, Kenny as bassist, and Jimmy as drummer.

[[File:ItHitstheFan015.png|thumb|Butters standing next to his graffitied name.]]
Butters is extremely adept in art and the show often makes examples of his abilities. In ""[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]"", Butters makes construction paper versions of the four boys for their animated Christmas short (this may be a reference to South Park's director of animation [[Eric Stough]], whom Butters is loosely based on). Butters also shows his artistic talents in ""[[AWESOM-O]]"", when he draws a picture of himself and his robot friend. In ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", he sends a letter to Kenny in the hospital which contains a drawing of them both in an airplane with the words ""ME AND MY FRIEND KENNY"" written above. As well, in ""[[Toilet Paper]]"" where the four boys get into trouble by their teacher, Stan claims that, ""Art class is for gaywads."" Butters then prominently states that he loves art class. Briefly in ""[[It Hits the Fan]]"" Kyle interrupts Butters tagging a building with his name in the style of a well practiced graffiti artist, which is strange because he could be charged with vandalism; Butters is always seen worrying about following rules. In ""Casa Bonita"" Butters shows the garbage dump worker a very accurate statue he made of Cartman out of garbage. In ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", Butters is shown using a sewing machine quite handily to make his cape for his alter ego.
He played with the rest of the boys as the left fielder, on their baseball team in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"". He was number 99 on the dodgeball team in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"". He is also seen playing football with the others in ""[[Raisins]]"". He has been shown several times to be somewhat weak physically, especially in fights. This might impact whatever sport skills he has.
In ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"", [[the boys]] shift the blame of writing a [[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|vulgar book]] on Butters, in the hopes to avoid punishment for creating something so disgusting. However, when the book becomes a success, Butters takes credit (believing he did create it after having assorted blackouts after reading ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'') and goes on to write a second book entitled ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]]''. Butters' style however is much more childish than that of the boys; the extent of his vulgar language involves repeated use of the words ""Pee-pee"" and ""Poop"". However, due to people constantly over-analyzing things for what was not really there, the book becomes an instant success, at least until the book supposedly causes a man to kill the [[Kardashians]]. Butters is actually a poor writer or at least a lot worse than Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.
Aside from speaking English, Butters is shown to understand at least one other language. In ""[[Fatbeard]]"", when Cartman asks residents of [[Somalia]] the location of the pirates, he asks Butters to ask them something, using a book to see how he would say the question in Somalian. When someone replies, Butters, while taking a quick glance at the book, can understand what the man is saying.
In ""[[The China Probrem]]"", Butters was shown wielding an semi-automatic handgun (Glock), given to him by Cartman. Due to the fact Butters was still a kid, his hands flailed wildly, and he was only able to shoot guys in their penis.

Prior to the timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', despite easing of [[COVID-19]] restrictions, Butters remains grounded and confined to his room for over 16 years. During this period, he picks up the trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), before starting to advertize them to the general public. His actions have been described as ""unspeakable"" and have ""destroyed many lives,"" which led to him being locked up in a mental institute known as [[South Park Mental Asylum Plus]]. He has since changed his name to ""Victor Chaos"", referencing his own villain alter-ego.

Following a visit from Stan and Kyle, Butters makes an escape from the mental institute and starts to advertize the investment of NFTs once more. Cartman, in an attempt to foil Stan and Kyle's plan in traveling back to the past and change the future, tracks down Butters and uses him to try advertize NFTs to their other friends (who are assisting in making time travel possible).

Stan, Kyle, and Cartman eventually reconcile and decide to fix their past relations as planned, setting an alternate timeline where Butters works as a waiter in [[Denny's|Denny's Applebee's Max]].

Butters has a small tuft of bright blond hair on the top of his head. He wears a turquoise jacket and dark green pants. For the rest of season 19, Butters wore a neck brace after trying to commit suicide in ""[[Safe Space]]"".

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', he wears a dark blue suit over a turquoise shirt and brown shoes. He also carries a pair of blue-tinted glasses on his forehead.

[[File:Innocent_Butters.png|thumb|Butters in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"".]]
Butters has a warm personality that everyone finds comforting. Fans consider him one of the sweetest, most innocent, and most gullible characters on the show. He is unique because he has the personality of a child, in contrast to the other more cynical, adult-like kids. He is generally much nicer and much more naive than the four main characters, although he and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] are shown bullying [[Mark Cotswolds]], a home-schooled boy, in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"", while it is worth noting that it was before the major character development of Butters in the show. The kids are often annoyed with Butters because he is not cruel, cold, gross, confident enough ""like a normal little boy"", as well as the fact that he is a ""pussy"". He is also vulnerable to being taken advantage of, and the boys often use him for self-defense when they are in very sticky situations, such as in ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", when they make Butters go get raped by the [[NAMBLA]] members to save them. However, Butters is saved from getting raped when [[Stuart McCormick]] is confused by the pedophiles as one of the young boys.

Unlike nearly all ''[[South Park]]'' characters, he rarely curses and instead uses euphemisms such as ""Aw, hamburgers"" or ""Son of a biscuit."" He has cursed a few times, however, with each instance meant to be very shocking. In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", for example, Butters solemnly says ""Fuck you, Eric"" to Cartman and farts on his face after his mental breakdown; in ""[[Raisins]]"", Butters says ''""I'd rather be a crying little pussy than a faggy goth kid""'', much to Stan's surprise; and ''""At least we have assholes""'' to [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. He is also noted for swearing a lot more heavily in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"". He has also said ''""You're poor as shit!""'' and ''""That's fuckin' gay!""'' (which he said quite a lot) during ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"". In the earlier seasons, Butters seemed much more intelligent, and he also seemed to use inappropriate words more often, even saying when the girls challenged them to a sledding race ''""Us men will show those skanky hos who is who!""''

Butters refines himself in self-improvement in almost everything, to perfection, studying regularly and often commenting on how he ""needs to learn to behave himself"". Other skills include tap dancing but he vowed to not do that talent anymore because he accidentally caused a very horrible tragedy in the tap dancing championships. Unfortunately, he also has extremely low self-esteem and therefore has no judgment as to when or how to use his skills, and perceives everyone around him as knowing much more than he does. Another side effect of this is that he is almost constantly worried about being grounded. Butters is a good student and considered to be a dork by his associates. Butters seems to be constantly seeking a role model, as evidenced when he takes to Cartman (unbeknownst to him) pretending to be a robot in ""[[AWESOM-O]]"". He constantly struggles to find acceptance among his associates, hence why he often does menial tasks in hopes that this will earn him favor and respect. In the same episode he reveals to Cartman (dressed as AWESOM-O) all of his darkest secrets, including the fact that he suffers from a herniated colon, which means he cannot always control his bowels and requires him to take a suppository through his anus regularly. In ""[[Casa Bonita]]"", it is revealed that Butters enjoys going to [[Stark's Pond]] and he always hangs out there. In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"" Butters is mistakenly accused of being bi-curious, and although he agrees, it is obvious he does not know what this means. Butters also unwittingly gave a very thoughtful speech in the same episode, regarding the treatment of bisexual children. He also admits to be ""bike-curious"" in ""[[The F Word]]"".

In ""[[Super Fun Time]]"", Butters is shown to be more assertive and less willing to go along with Cartman's plans and rule-breaking. In ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", he took the fact that he kissed [[Sally Darson]] as a sign that he was now a man and began thinking on how he needs a job to pay for bills, even though he is only a fourth-grader. In ""[[Raisins]]"", he is shown to be somewhat wise, in the end when he basically tells Stan ""you can't be upset forever"". Butters' biggest problem seems to be self-confidence, the will to stand up for himself. He gets taken advantage of by nearly everyone he comes across. In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", once he believes he has actually become a vampire, he is not so easily pushed around anymore as he thinks he is immortal. In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", Butters finally stands up for himself by stating to the camp counselors that his confusion is nothing more than a result of the counselors telling several boys, that are assumed to be 'bicurious', that they are confused without explanation. Butters also showed some self-confidence in ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"", where he told the [[the boys]] that he would not be tricked, and told them off by saying that they can ""suck on his wiener"". This outburst stunned the boys, leaving Cartman to ironically call Butters an inconsiderate jerk. Sometimes when Butters is very happy, his smile appears to have risen almost far up to his eyes while the bottom part of his face is almost all skin and nothing more as seen in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"", ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"", ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"", ""[[T.M.I.]]"", and ""[[City Sushi]]"" (mostly). Although he is ten years old, Butters still pees like a pre-school boy by pulling his pants right down and pulling his shirt up as he stands in front of the urinal. In ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"", it appears that Butters may have an attraction to fat women, as he fell for one of the Kardashians because she was ""so big and squishy"". In ""[[City Sushi]]"", he is mistakenly diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, as he impersonates various characters while playing like many normal kids do.

However, his kind, sweet, and gullible personality disappears in ""[[Going Native]]"", and is replaced with an upset, pissy, antisocial, and rude persona, as he beats up Scott Malkinson for having such a low self esteem due to the fact he has diabetes, and when his boy classmates attempt to reason with him, Butters immediately lashes out at Kyle, saying he believes he knows everything and acts as though he is an expert at everything, even though he is not, and then rips on Stan, who he says believes the world revolves around himself, and how Stan only cares about self image.  Butters continues to insult his classmates, saying that they are all just as bad, selfish pieces of crap like Cartman, as well as being stuck up, claiming that the only one with any decency is Kenny.  This personality fades away, however, when he has a ceremony at his home land, Hawaii, and then returns to his kind and innocent personality.
[[File:Butters_1.png|thumb|left|Butters (presumably) subconscious view of [[Stephen Stotch|his father]].]]
Butters shows obvious signs of mental trauma, most likely due to [[Stephen Stotch|his father]]'s psychologically and physically abusive ""parenting"". As revealed in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", this trauma extends to such an extent that he falls asleep and wakes up to the sound of his own screams. Further evidence of psychological trauma due to his father can be seen in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"", where he was told to imagine ''""the most prominent thing in his mind""'', which happened to be his father, screaming that he was grounded; the imaginary version of his father later morphed into a monster-like being.

However, his father is likely not his only source of psychological trauma. Butters' social isolation and constant ridicule at the hands of some of his [[List of Male 4th Graders|classmates]] likely traumatizes him as well. Furthermore, in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"", Butters was revealed to have been molested by his [[Budd Stotch|uncle]], although he did not seem to realize it was molestation, this is likely another source of trauma. As a result of these events, Butters has very low self-esteem, constantly putting himself down as well believing he is a bad child who deserves punishment. Butters also has a nervous stutter - it is likely this can be attributed to psychological trauma. Though possibly [[Grandma Stotch|Butters' grandma]] was the source of psychological trauma as she was constantly hurting him physically and mentally.

[[File:Professor Chaos.png|thumb|Butters as Professor Chaos]]
Early in his career as [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], Butters was successful at bringing chaos to his fourth grade classroom when he stole the erasers from the chalkboard. During the process of changing into his Professor Chaos costume, Butters was discovered by [[Dougie]], who chose to join him as his sidekick, [[General Disarray]], after being eliminated in the boys' quest to find a new fourth member. Together, Professor Chaos and General Disarray hatched out evil plots that included trying to flood the world with his garden hose and destroying the ozone layer with aerosol spray.

In ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", Butters devises a series of supposedly original evil plots, only to abandon each of them after General Disarray informs him that they have already been used on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He nearly goes insane after a while of this, but gets consoled later by the reassurance that this is only because the show has run so long, not his own lack of creativity. This itself was inspired by the real-life frustration that creator's [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] coming up with ideas and plots only to find out the that The Simpsons had already beaten them to the punch. Parker and Stone themselves literally went through every episode to find something that had never been done. And eventually they did: boy bands. They conceived an episode only to find out the ''Simpsons'' did and released such an episode right before theirs was set to air.

Butters is an only child. His parents, [[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] (Chris in some appearances) and [[Linda Stotch]], are very authoritarian, strict and, at some points, abusive towards their son — often severely scolding him for circumstances that are entirely beyond his control. This has evidently affected Butters psychologically; he often tells himself off in the absence of his parents. It is also hinted that the justification for this abuse lacks rationality. As additional evidence of psychological problems, he has stated in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"" that he wakes up to the sound of his own screams. However, it is clear that Linda cares deeply for him; she becomes hysterical when he faked his death in ""[[Marjorine]]"", and becomes extremely distressed when he is missing in ""[[Imaginationland]]"" and ""[[Casa Bonita]]"". Also, before his father ever appeared in the show, an adult man who is very similar to Butters was seen as a background in early seasons.

He is intimidated of his dominating father, who he is obliged to respectfully refer to as ""Sir"". His father uses fear as his primary parenting tactic with Butters, once intentionally frightening him with threats of 'Super-AIDS'. It is shown on a number occasions that he really does care about Butters, but he believes his methods are the best way in which to raise him. Linda, however, has been shown to be much more tender to her son, hugging and kissing him often. She seems to go along with Stephen's harshness only because she believes that its the best of her son.

It was revealed in ""[[AWESOM-O]]"" that his family includes an aunt and uncle who live in Los Angeles, Butters' claims in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"" that his [[Budd Stotch|Uncle Budd]] molested him. There was a mention of a grandmother in ""[[Freak Strike]]"" who had a stroke shortly after she saw Butters on television with testicles on his chin and then his parents went to visit her in the hospital. Ten seasons later, Butters mentions his grandma again in ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"", stating she is from Virginia. In ""[[Butterballs]]"", [[Grandma Stotch]] gets a prominent role, constantly bullying her grandson, which makes her another member of the Stotch family that abuses Butters. It is unknown if that grandma was his maternal or paternal grandmother, or the same one that is mentioned in the episodes before that. Also, while Butters and all members of his family shown appear to be entirely Caucasian, Cartman's repeated insult to Butters is ""Butters you black asshole"". Instead of suggesting that Butters has some African or Afro-American descent, it is more likely that this is simply a childish insult out of Cartman's stupidity, ironic due to Butters showing no stereotypical African-American traits, and often exhibiting stereotypical Caucasian-American traits.

[[File:Butters barbies.jpg|thumb|Butters playing with his Barbie and his cut out doll of himself.]]
Stephen and Linda are very strict with Butters and have both abused and neglected him in one way or another or after his friends get him in serious trouble. He is usually grounded after he gets involved with something, because they usually conclude that it was either Butters all on his own or that he at least played a major role, and do not believe that he is being bullied. They have also threatened to ground Butters for things he cannot control, such as in ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", Stephen orders him to stop having nightmares or he would be grounded. Also in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"", Butters' parents ground him for making a silly face in his school photo, believe he is wearing make-up at one point (he is not at all) in and are convinced that his normal face is ""silly"" and has ""made himself look like a girl"". It is assumed that Linda and Stephen actually have some sort of compulsive need to punish Butters, as demonstrated in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", during which they threaten to ground him for minor mistakes such as misplacing the chocolate Quick mix. When Butters, under the belief that he is a vampire, refuses to listen to their threats, they become unnerved and afraid that they will never be able to ground Butters again. After Butters returns to his normal behavior, his parents become immensely relieved that they again have dominion over their son, and immediately proceed to ground him again.

In ""[[The List]]"", it is shown that Butters parents were planning to ground him if the girls at school thought he was the ugliest in the class. Stephen also physically beats Butters in ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"" - Cartman pretended to be Butters on the phone and insulted his parents, really goading them. Then he sat outside to hear Stephen and Linda tear through him. Considering Stephen and Linda's possible problems controlling their anger, it is likely that ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"" was not the only time he was beaten.

The most distinguishing abuse was in the season five episode ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"" which centered on how Linda sent Butters to spy on his father to find out what he was getting Linda for their wedding anniversary, and, among other things, Butters saw Stephen go into a men's bathhouse. Butters did not understand what it was and told his mother, who then, in a spot of insanity, attempted to kill Butters by pushing a car with Butters inside off a dock. Linda then wrote a suicide note and was about to kill herself just when Stephen stepped in; the resulting confrontation changed her mind about suicide. Stephen and Linda tried to keep Butters' murder a secret and blamed it on ""some Puerto Rican guy"". Butters meanwhile found a way home and his parents came clean. When he found out that his mother had tried to kill him and his father was gay (or rather bisexual), he was horrified, but tried to pass it off. When asked if he was really going to be okay after discovering all that he admitted ""No, I'm lying.""

At the end of the sixth season, in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"", Butters gets revenge on his parents for their abuse of him (culminating in them hiring an actor to pretend to be Butters' future self so as to scare him out of doing drugs) by paying Cartman to smear feces all over his house. The act ironically leads the [[:Category:Stotch Family|Stotches]] to realize how badly they have treated their son and they apologize, an act that is contrasted by Stan Marsh's parents refusing to apologize for them hiring an actor to be Stan's future self, to the extent that they mutilate their actor when Stan tricks them into thinking he chopped off his own hand. Since then, the Stotches have not been shown hurting their son physically and in ""[[About Last Night...]]"", Stephen tells Butters that he loves him. However, he did believe that the world was soon going to end as [[Barack Obama|Obama]] won the presidential election so one could think this was because Stephen was going hysterical or he wanted to make peace with his son.

Despite all the abuse Butters has received, his parents have been shown to really care deeply about their son, this can be seen in ""[[Marjorine]]"" where they go as far as to even promise him not to ground him ""for more than a couple weeks"" if he does not kill himself. As shown in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"" they sell a reluctant Butters to Paris Hilton for $250 million. Butters realizes that many of Paris' pets have killed themselves and gets away, and [[Paris Hilton|Paris]] is swallowed anally by [[Mr. Slave]]. As a result, his parents ground him. In ""[[The Return of Chef]]"", Butters briefly mentions that his [[Budd Stotch|Uncle Budd]] has committed sexual acts on him, but has not realized that it is sexual molestation.

In ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", after Butters returns home, Cartman notes that he fed Butters' cat. The cat has since not been mentioned and has yet to make an appearance.

Butters has become Cartman's most frequent bullying victim. Butters sees Cartman sometimes as a friend and treats him as so. However, Cartman takes advantage of this and finds Butters extremely easy to manipulate and convert to his point of view, or get him to do what he wants. He is often extremely cruel to him, and uses him as a scapegoat whenever he needs someone to blame. He constantly makes fun of him for his effeminate tendencies and his naive, innocent, nature, often calling him ""gay"". Butters does not even take a stand on Cartman and that somehow, Butters is the only character who does not hate Cartman despite all the cruelty he receives from Cartman. 

In ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", Cartman easily gets Butters to vote for his idea of a ""turd sandwich"" simply by describing the candidates in a misleading way. In ""[[Go God Go]]"", he gets Butters to bury him in snow so that he can be unfrozen three weeks later in time for the release of the Wii video game console. Butters is in heart hurt by all of Cartman's bullying and when Cartman goes too far with it, it gives Butters the opportunity to make Cartman pay for his bullying and cruelty. However, in ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", Butters helps Cartman apologize to everyone he offended and after this, Cartman personally apologizes to Butters for all the things he did Butters wrong at and Butters seems to forgive Eric without hesitation.

In many episodes entire plots are centered on Cartman's antics against Butters. In ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", Cartman gets Butters grounded and makes several prank calls to Butters's parents. Cartman then frames Butters for making the prank calls by imitating his voice, which leads to both parents beating and abusing Butters. 

In ""[[Casa Bonita]]"", Cartman faked an apocalypse so Butters would hide in a bomb shelter for three days, so Cartman could go with Kyle, Stan, and Kenny to [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]], instead of Butters. However the other boys found out about this and Cartman gets arrested for causing Butters' disappearance and was sentenced to a week in juvenile hall. In ""[[AWESOM-O]]"", Cartman dressed as a robot to trick Butters, but in the end this failed miserably. Butters happily got his revenge by publicly showing a tape of Cartman dressed like [[Britney Spears]] trying to woo over a cardboard standee of [[Justin Timberlake]]. 

In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", Butters also gets revenge at Cartman by farting on his face and giving him the finger for swearing Jesus' name in front of everybody and ruining their band. He also taunts Cartman for being the real 'ugliest' kid in their class and mocks his neo-Nazism in a deleted scene in ""[[The List]]"". In ""[[Pee]]"", Butters remarks ""Aw, you lived?"" when he sees Cartman. In ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", most kids at [[South Park Elementary]] ignore Cartman because they feel he deserves it. Unlike the other boys, Butters is not aware of the plan and Cartman believes that Butters is the only one who can see him now that he is ""dead"".

In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", he repeatedly invited Butters over to spend the night to play pranks on him, including putting cat poop on his face and moon Butters. It backfired when he made an inappropriate picture, featuring him putting Butters' penis in his mouth, and which ended up being showed to the entire fourth grade class. In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", after Cartman gets brutalized by Wendy, Butters agreed with Craig that he always hated Cartman with everyone else, which made it clear that Butters was finally standing up to Cartman, even though we initially seemed to be on Cartman's side as he said ""I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her."" This has not seemed to stick, as he goes right back to Cartman's side in ""[[The China Probrem]]"", acting as Cartman's sidekick. 

In ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", Cartman shows as much compassion as the other boys towards Butters after he is queefed upon, and even gives him a present. He then participated in a statewide attempt to ban queefing, with Butters as a mascot, although he refuses to go near Butters after he was queefed on. Cartman ""punishes"" Butters with the tetherball for not kissing another girl during fourth grade in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"". 

In ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"", Cartman posted wanted signs of Butters that authorized the U.S border patrol to shoot and kill Butters on sight. When Cartman joined the border patrol, he tried to murder Butters but failed. It is revealed in ""[[Going Native]]"" that Butters is sick and tired of putting up with Cartman getting the last words. In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"" Butters joins Kyle, Stan, Tolkien, Craig, Clyde, and Jimmy to smash his electronics due to them thinking that he was [[Skankhunt42]].

His friendship with Kyle is fairly decent; Kyle treats Butters more kindly than the other boys, as seen when he decided to take Butters along to Casa Bonita for his birthday. In ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", Kyle attempted to tell Butters how Cartman was taking advantage of him whilst he slept over at his house. However, Kyle is not against using Butters as a ""guinea pig"" when it comes to experiments or undercover jobs. Kyle occasionally makes fun of Butters, swears at him, or calls him names, as well as using him as a scapegoat (along with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny) whenever he needs someone else to take blame. He also agreed with Cartman's plan to kill Butters after Kenny threw shuriken stuck in his eye in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"" to avoid punishment. Under the influence of ''hapahui apahoha'' in ""[[Going Native]]"", Butters angrily tells Kyle, ""You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle? Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert!"" Butters has harassed Kyle, as shown in ""[[The List]]"", and ""bullies"" him for being Jewish, usually because of Cartman's influence and manipulation. Kyle generally sees Butters as a close friend and Butters sees him as a close friend too. Kyle also defended Butters for not kissing a girl in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"".

Butters took Kenny's place after he died, leading to more interaction between the two in later episodes. Butters friendship to Kenny seems to be stronger than Cartman, since Cartman usually makes fun of both Butters and Kenny. In ""[[Kenny Dies]]"", Butters draws a picture of him and Kenny (as best friends) together in an airplane, which Kyle delivers to Kenny at the hospital. Kenny plays the ""good cop"" and comforts Butters in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"" and Butters tries to help Kenny with his cat-pee addiction during ""[[Major Boobage]]"". The two are also playing together in a sandbox in ""[[Eek, A Penis!]]"". In ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", Kenny and Butters can be seen hugging when Stan and Kyle break 100,000 points on Guitar Hero. Also, in ""[[The Ring]]"", Butters seems quite alarmed when he discovered Kenny has a ""whore"" girlfriend. Butters is also often sharing things with Kenny like in ""[[Fat Camp]]"" when he shares his cup to scoop up Kenny's puke when he is dared to eat it. In ""[[Going Native]]"" he admits that Kenny is the only person in school that has a sense of dignity. When the natives of Hawaii want to kill Kenny for being an outsider Butters stands in their way considering Kenny as his best friend. At the end of the episode both of the boys get Hawaii rewards cards.

[[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] and Butters are often seen together in many episodes, most notably in ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"", in which they are seen together throughout the whole episode. When they were at Sunday School, Tolkien is seen next to Butters when he goes to tell [[The Boys|the boys]] about Timmy. When Kenny gets [[List of Kenny's Deaths|run over]], they are next to each other crossing the street, and when they sneak into the church they are seen together again. In ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"" they are seen on the same sled. In the class room they sit next to each other. They also both join Cartman's Band ""Faith+1"" in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"". In the beginning of ""The List"", when Butters tells the boys that the girls in their classroom have a list rating every boy from cutest to ugliest, Tolkien asks him which one of the boys is the ugliest, to which Butters says he does not know yet, saying that the girls woudl not let anyone else but themselves see the list. Although Tolkien and Butters are known to be on good terms with each other, in the end of ""[[W.T.F.]]"", they are seen fighting with each other, blaming each other for the loss of stardom of the W.T.F. while Cartman and Kyle fight each other for the same reason, as well as Stan and Jimmy fighting each other for the same reason.

Stan's friendship with Butters is similar to that of Kyle's: he can be friendly to Butters, hanging out with him in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"" when the two of them learned the truth behind ""Motivation Corp"", to using Butters as a scapegoat (along with Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny) or as a ""guinea pig"" for the boys' antics, such as in ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"". In ""[[Going Native]]"", Butters tells Stan that he is a ""kid who thinks that the entire planet revolves around him and only cares about ''his'' image"". Otherwise, whenever Butters stands up to Stan, he does so towards all the boys: ""You're all fake and stuck up! The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts!"" (""[[Going Native]]"").  Butters and Stan have also had more amicable moments. In ""[[Raisins]]"", Stan defended Butters' speech (""No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all."") and ditched the goth kids when he realized, ""[Butters] is right. I like life a lot more than hating it."" At the end of ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", Butters took Stan's place in the game, and told Cartman that he wanted to be the betrayer when he reached a celebrity-like status. Butters also revealed to Stan alone that he was Professor Chaos. Although Stan took it to mean that he was coming out of the closet, he said he was okay with it. 

[[File:WhereMyCountryGone067.png|thumb|right]]
Butters met Charlotte in ""[[Where My Country Gone?]]"", after being forced by the other boys to find a Canadian girl to have a ""Hot Cosby"" with to establish peace. Though Butters was reluctant at first, he and Charlotte developed feelings for each other and decided to take things slow. Charlotte and her family returned to Canada at the end of the episode, but she promised to Skype Butters when she got home. 

In ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"" they are seen Skyping with each other. They Skype again in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", with Butters affectionately calling her ""baby"" and ""honey"". However, in ""[[Wieners Out]]"", Butters and Charlotte have ended their relationship, with Charlotte deciding to join the girls' protest against the boys.

Craig and Butters seemed to have been friends at one time in the earlier seasons. In ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"" they bully [[Mark Cotswolds]] throughout the episode. In ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"" they are at the gas station together when the couple arrive; Butters was the mechanic and Craig was playing spaceman. In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"" they are again seen together urging Cartman to fight [[Wendy Testaburger]]. However, later in the series their friendship seems to have vanished; in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"" Craig is the second kid to hit Butters in the head with the tether ball while he is tied to the tether ball pole. Craig is shown as being unable to remember whether or not Butters was present at dinner in ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"", noting, ""Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not."" which is ironic considering the fact Craig seems to fade in and out of the show as a background character. However a benevolent situation occurred in ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"" where Butters was looking at the Eavesdropper tabloids with Craig and Stan; Craig was getting along with Butters. In ""[[The Magic Bush]]"", Butters shows he cares about Craig when Cartman posts videos of [[Laura Tucker]] on the internet.

Canadians,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Canadians,,"are citizens of [[Canada]].

Canadians are portrayed as having oval shaped flappy Pac-Man-like heads with black beady eyes. The rest of their bodily layout is very rectangular and straight, and in some episodes, individuals are depicted as wearing shirts with their first initials emblazoned on the front.

Some Canadian celebrities portrayed on ''[[South Park]]'', such as [[Sarah McLachlan]] and [[Justin Bieber]], do not have the distinguishing features that traditional Canadian characters do. This is likely to make them more identifiable.

Canadians speak with an exaggerated accent and usually end all of their sentences with 'Eh', 'Buddy', 'Pal', 'Guy' or 'Friend'. They also pronounce 'about' as 'aboot', and 'sorry' as 'soorry'.

Canada is one of the main locations in the game, encountered during [[O Canada (Quest)|O Canada]] quest. Its residents can be found in the cities, with some providing services such as currency exchange and curing Dire AIDS.

Captain Hindsight,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Hindsight,,"Jack Brolin, a news reporter, wanted to improve his hindsight by using an experimental machine. However, a retroactive spider got into the machine and his hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels. He became known under the pseudonym, Captain Hindsight, as he fought for peace and the American way with his 3 companions, Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda.

Captain Hindsight first appears when there is a fire at an apartment building. [[Coon and Friends]] come to help stop the fire, but before they can help, Captain Hindsight arrives. He ""helps"" the people in need by lecturing them about what they did wrong to get into a certain accident and what methods they could have used to avoid it, instead of actually rescuing them. Despite this, civilians still feel much better afterwards. He does this again when BP drill a hole in the Gulf.

He was personally invited to superheroes group Coon and Friends by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], but he refused to join, therefore, Cartman frames him for having sex with Courtney Love, however, the pictures were actually of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in disguise and a hobo with Captain Hindsight's face Photoshopped onto it. Partly because of this, but also due to the constant pressure he felt, he removed his special ability through the machine he gained it from in ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", and went back to work as a correspondant again.

[[File:Coon2Hindsight07.png|thumb|right|As Jack Brolin]]
Captain Hindsight is the only superhero in South Park to wear an actual, typical superhero costume, which is not made up of other mix-matched clothes. His hair is black with a single curl on his forehead, whilst his head is shaped closer to a regular person's than the rest of the cast, with a slight cleft chin. He wears a yellow base suit, with red briefs over it, which has a black H emblazoned on his chest, with a blue eye above it. Around his waist is a plain red belt, with a red buckle. He covers his hands and feet with a pair of matching gloves and boots, as well as adorning a red cape, which bears his symbol on the back. Overall, his appearance is very similar to Superman's, with yellow replacing blue and a different symbol.

As Jack Brolin, he wears a blue jacket and matching pants, with a white shirt complete with tie, due to his career as a reporter, another allusion to Superman.

Perfect 20/20 hindsight is the power that Captain Hindsight is most associated with. With his natural hindsight abilities raised to superhuman levels, due to an accident with a retroactive spider, Captain Hindsight can immediately know how an event could have been avoided just by looking at the scene. As it is perfect hindsight, it may give him knowledge that he did not already have, such as building designs, to work. However, this power appears to force him to know how things could have been stopped and express it vocally, as he is seen muttering to himself when he was talking to Mysterion, leading him to label it as a curse as he cannot save the people anyway. The greatest weakness to this power as Hindsight demonstrated, is the fact the ability only works after the action has occurred, which more often than not makes him regret doing the action in the first place and second guesses every action he does.

His only known, typical superpower, Captain Hindsight adopts a Superman pose as he flies. He appears to be able to move at superhuman speeds, as he is able to appear at catastrophes shortly after they happen.

[[File:Sidekicks.jpg|thumb|Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda]]
It is also revealed he has shmoo-like sidekicks named Shoulda, Woulda, and Coulda (all references to his Hindsight ability); however none of them had made an appearance or was even mentioned during the actual events of the episodes beyond that first introduction. So what they are capable of or what they even are is never revealed.

Jack can be found working in the [[South Park Gazette]] office. [[The New Kid]] can take a selfie with him after activating abilities from four different classes.

Carol McCormick,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Carol_McCormick,,"is the wife to [[Stuart McCormick]], as well as the mother of [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Kevin McCormick|Kevin]], and [[Karen McCormick|Karen]]. She first appeared in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Starvin' Marvin]]"".

Her family seems to be fairly religious and Roman Catholic, like most of the townspeople. She yells at Kenny for wanting to miss church in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' to go watch ''[[Asses of Fire]]'' while Stuart stood up for the Church in ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"", where they were one of the few families in town that did not convert to atheism. They also continue to pray after Kenny has died on a few occasions, and Kenny's funerals, when they occur, are always religious in nature.

In ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", it is revealed that she joined the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] for free beer and regrets it because she has to rebirth Kenny every time he dies.

She seems to like knitting. In ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", she is shown knitting when Kenny tells her that he made her favorite drink. She also says that knitting a sweater is better than molesting children in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"".

From 1997 to 1999, she was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]]. Bergman described the character as one of her five favorite voice roles in the series, together with [[Liane Cartman]], [[Sheila Broflovski]], [[Wendy Testaburger]], and [[Shelly Marsh]], also mentioning that she based the voice of the character on a ""female version of Bill Clinton"".[[File:45a.jpg|thumb|left|Carol on the SP-site]]
Carol wears a lime-green T-shirt which usually reads ""I'm with Stupid"", and dark blue jeans. The arrow is supposed to point at Stuart, but she is usually standing on the wrong side of him, so it points off in some other direction. Her hair is red, and similar in style to [[Red]]'s, but her bangs go in the same direction as [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s. She has a shadowy patch on her right cheek, which may be a bruise, or simply filth.[[File:Screenshot-by-nimbus_(6).png|thumb|Carol in her formal attire in ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]""]]

In ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", her shirt had an American flag embroidered on it, accompanied by the phrase ""God Bless"". When the McCormick's went on the John Denver experience, however, it appeared as a solid green T-shirt. In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", it is a solid, but darker green.

For special occasions, she wears a fake fur coat with a red crop top underneath and a red miniskirt, but as of [[Season Twelve]] she would wear a dark green blouse and a long gray skirt. At events such as funerals, she wears a much more black fancy shirt and dress with a veil. 

At night, she wears a nightshirt with several bunnies on it and pajama pants.

As of ""[[The Ring]]"", like many other adults, her appearance has been cleaned up, including small subtle changes to her hairstyle, T-shirt, arms and pants. Her arms have been straightened, the shirt is no longer angled, and her hair now has fine detail.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Carol appears as an elderly woman. She is visibly aged, has gained some weight, and wears a dark green sweater with a large stripe design. Her hair remains similar to the hairstyle she had when she was younger, albeit greying. 

[[Image:210_parents_with_herpes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Her original appearance]] She and her husband [[Stuart McCormick]] are prone to excessive drinking, and often fight and bicker with one another. Carol often claims that if Stuart would stop drinking and being lazy, and get a job, they might not be so hungry and poor. Their fighting often escalates to physical beating, and she [[Chickenlover|once gave him a black eye.]] She seems to have quite some strength, seeing as when she hits Stuart as well as when she tackled Gerald Broflovski to the ground in ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"". Carol does care for Stuart deep down, though, as she was concerned for him when he went ill after consuming a drink mixed with abortion medication, got his nose broken on the John Denver experience, and was molested by the entire [[NAMBLA]] Society in ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"". 

However, she also seems to think that the McCormick residence primarily belongs to her, as in ""[[Chickenlover]]"", she says (regarding Stuart): ""I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!"" and yells a similar phrase at him in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"". However, Stuart and [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] built that same house when they were teenagers, as revealed in ""[[Chickenpox]]"".

Cartman Impostor,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Cartman_Impostor,,"was an unidentified young boy who appeared in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Fat Camp]]"".

In ""[[Fat Camp]]"", he was a drug addict who was supposed to be in rehab. He had somehow escaped, though, and got by supplying Cartman, who was in fat camp, with candy in return for a cut of the profits - originally 10%, but eventually increased to 20% since he was also impersonating Cartman, generating suspicion from [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. He can impersonate voices with ease, allowing him to impersonate Cartman easily. Undisguised, his voice is a lot less harsh than Cartman's voice, reminiscent of [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s voice when he speaks in a low tone.

Eventually, Kyle exposes him after ""Cartman"" delivers his first decent ""I learned something today"" speech - something the real Cartman would never do. Since Kenny had been arrested for prostitution in New York, Kyle forced the impostor to stand in for Kenny's last stunt (staying in [[Ms. Crabtree]]'s uterus for 6 hours). Unfortunately, the extreme pressure inside Crabtree killed the impostor.

His actual appearance is unknown since he has only been seen disguised as someone else. Originally he wore Cartman's blue hat, red coat, and yellow gloves to looks like a thinner Cartman who lost a lot of weight. After [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] exposed him, he forced him to stand in for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s final stunt on [[Krazy Kenny Show|his show]], so he wore Kenny's orange parka. Underneath, though, he has auburn hair, similar somewhat to Kyle's, but his hair sticks straight up, unlike Kyle's ""Jewfro"".

It was revealed in ""[[Fat Camp]]"" that he was a drug addict who escaped rehab. Using these facts, we can assume he doesn't even care about his health, however he does like to eat more healthier alternatives of certain foods like tofu pudding, which the real Cartman probably wouldn't. Later in the episode, he attempted to start an ""I learned something today..."" speech, however, whether he was doing this because he actually cared or whether he did it to simply keep up the masquerade is unknown.

Chris (Dad),https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_(Dad),,"is the father of [[The New Kid]], who appears in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' and ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

Chris, along with [[Kelly (Mom)|Kelly]] and the New Kid, moves to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] at the start of the game. Chris demands the New Kid go out and makes some new friends. He then doesn't do much for the first 2 days besides grounding the New Kid when they get lost in the forest or don't come home at night. Unlike Kelly, Chris will not allow his child to friend him until they already have at least 50 friends, claiming that only then will he ""be impressed.""

When the New Kid is chasing the Gnomes, they find Chris and Kelly speaking to each other, worried about them. The two then make love, which can be heard throughout the walls. The New Kid meets up with the Warlock leader and a boss fight then commences upon the bed Chris and Kelly are making love on. The fight is often interrupted when Chris's testicles come swinging by.

Chris and Kelly play bigger parts in the second game.

At many points in the game, the New Kid will have to meet up with [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]], who will allow them to choose an additional superhero class and then revise their ""origin story."" Regardless of how the backstory is altered, the New Kid will always find that Chris has ""fucked"" Kelly. The Coon fails to understand this is a common thing that happens to all people and considers this the New Kid's ""tragic"" backstory.

Each day ends with the New Kid coming home to find their parents arguing with each other. Chris berates Kelly for giving information to [[Mr. Mackey|the School Councillor]] and [[PC Principal|the School Principal]] about the New Kid's gender and race after the talks. Chris is angry because he wants to keep the New Kid's real backstory secret. They attempt to hide their fighting when they notice their child is watching, and go into the bedroom to fight.

When traveling through Mephesto's lab, the New Kid finds a room, where both Chris and Kelly are locked up. To proceed to the next room, the New Kid needs DNA from one of their parents. This involves either cutting off Chris's head or tearing off Kelly's arm, either of which will result in the victim dying. The New Kid then puts the head/arm in the scanner and can continue.

In ""[[Farts of Future Past]]"", the New Kid inadvertently farts themself back in time to their origin story. They enter their parents' bedroom, where, after seeing 2 versions of his child, Chris reveals the New Kid's true backstory. He explains that, when he was younger, he created a [[Facebook]] page, and managed to make over 2 million friends in under 3 hours. Scientists kidnapped him and Kelly, running experiments to discover the source of their powers. The two then fell in love and conceived the New Kid. They had to run away, moving from town to town, until they got to South Park. After telling the New Kids and the Coon this, they feel better and decide to live happily.

During the explanation, his Facebook profile shows his relationship status as ""married [https://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/File:Cris_Facebook_pre_Experiments.png]"", showing he was married before he met Kelly.

The skin color and hair color of Chris depends on the skin and hair color of the new kid. Chris wears a white shirt and grey trousers with a black belt.

Chris seems to be the more strict of the two parents. He kicks the New Kid out of the house at the start of Stick of Truth. He is also the one who criticizes the New Kid and grounds them when they are not home on time.

However, he had an extreme change of heart in The Fractured But Whole, he no longer encourages the New Kid to socialize, but instead tries to prevent them from catching much attention. He also seems to be more intolerant towards the New Kid's farts, even expressing hatred for the child themself for it in his dreams.

Chris is a concerned father to the New Kid, but often is the one to tell the New Kid off. He seems to get irritated by the New Kid's silent nature, hardly ever speaking in the games. Chris is protective over his child, worried that people will find out about their background and eventually lock them up again.

The two's relationship was not majorly featured, but it's still demonstrated as loving each other. They also had a long sex scene throughout the quest ""[[Defeat the Underpants Gnomes]]"", further proving their love for one another.

In The Fractured But Whole, Kelly and Chris are seen fighting each other. When Mr. Mackey speaks to Kelly for clarification about the New Kid's gender identity, Chris berates her, worried people will find out the truth. This then continues until they argue all the time, not caring whether the New Kid sees or not. Even in [[The Many Asses of Dr. Mephesto]], when the New Kid has to make a decision of who to kill, the two yell at each other from across the room and each tries to persuade the New Kid to kill the other. In the later plot where they were visited by the New Kid from the future, they tell their child the truth, the two feel better and make up with each other. And as a result, they make out with each other in the post-credit scene.

After [[Eric Cartman]] fakes Tourette's Syndrome, he writes to Dateline's Chris Hansen to do a show about his 'illness', with the intent of simply spouting off as many hateful and politically incorrect things as he can think of. Hansen agrees to the idea, switching from catching pedophiles to talking about Tourette's. However, when Cartman truly begins to lose control of what he's able to say and not say, he goes to Hansen to call off the show and attempts to leave. Hansen stops him by simply saying his catchphrase, ""have a seat"", which seems to result in a low-level mind-control, forcing Cartman to obey. Hansen then informs Cartman that the latter will be on the show. With Cartman seated, he went on to add how a pedophile, named Louis Conradt, refused to appear on ''To Catch a Predator'' and then ""shot himself"".

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', [[Gregory]] told [[the boys]] to procure the Mole's help in saving [[Terrance and Phillip]]. The Mole helps the boys infiltrate the USO show, but the mission fails after Cartman forgets to shut down the base's security system. As a result, the Mole is fatally injured by a group of army attack dogs.

As he died, he sang ""[[The Mole's Reprise]]"", while Kyle held him and softly eased him into death. At his moment of passing away, The Mole continued his pattern of hatred towards God. The Mole, like everyone else who died in the war, was presumably brought back to life after [[Kenny McCormick]]'s wish to Satan.

He made a brief cameo appearance in ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"", where he is seen on ''[[Conan O'Brien|Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', while Stan channel surfs.

He has an unkempt appearance and carries a shovel with him on his back. He dresses in dark green and brown camouflage and wears fingerless gloves. He has messy brown hair, a prematurely lined face and prominent ears. He has bags under his eyes and thick eyebrows. He is usually seen smoking a cigarette.

The Mole smokes cigarettes, is foul-mouthed, and has an outspoken grudge against [[God]], whom he blames for everything wrong with the world. He displays a tough exterior and appears to have a jaded outlook, as well as being abrasive towards others. He also appears to be manic and emotionally unstable. He also expresses a hatred for guard dogs. His character is influenced by Grantaire from Les Misérables, just as Gregory is similar to Enjolras, although his song, ""The Mole's Reprise"" also parallels Éponine's ""A Little Fall of Rain"". Despite his abrasive personality, he still has an immature side to him as shown where he is seen playing with a View-Master using them as binoculars.

The only family member to appear on-screen is his mother.
The Mole does not appear to have a very good relationship with his mother. According to the Mole, his mother attempted an abortion by stabbing him in the heart with a clothes hanger while he was still in her womb. He does appear to be intimidated by his mother, still doing as she says. His mother does not agree with his misotheism, often grounding him for saying bad things about God.

[[File:Laresistancereprise.JPG|thumb|The Mole dies as Kyle tries to console him and [[the boys]] look on.]]
Kyle showed a certain amount of concern for the Mole's safety, advising him to be careful when infiltrating the USO show. Later on, as the Mole lay dying, Kyle attempted to give him solace, easing him into death. Notably, they also shared a short duet, ""[[The Mole's Reprise]]"".

Stan seemed to think that the Mole was a little crazy, saying to Kyle, ""Damn, dude, that kid is fucked up."" Earlier on, the Mole momentarily throttled Stan and interrogated him as to who sent them.

When the Mole instructed Cartman to turn off the alarms, he repeated it, implying that the Mole thinks Cartman is a bad listener. In that same minute, Cartman called him a ""British piece of shit"". When the Mole died, Cartman just watched on, and did not seem to show much concern. So from all this, we can safely assume that the two have rivalry problems with each other. Although that last backup could also be from Cartman's selfish and manipulative personality.

The Mole blames God for everything that is wrong with the world. Throughout the movie, The Mole refers to God as a ""faggot"" and ""bitch"". Upon his death he continues to loathe God but seems to believe his meeting with God is inevitable.

Although they never appear on-screen together in the final film, the Mole is implied to have had previous contact with [[Gregory]], who personally recommended the boys procure his help in the upcoming operation to free [[Terrance and Phillip]].

In the [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/south-park.html official eighth draft] for the movie, Gregory introduces Christophe to the others with Christophe digging underneath the ground similar to how Bugs Bunny would. Gregory tells everybody about the things The Mole does, with The Mole responding negatively to most of what's said. However, this part was cut out, and we see Stan, Kyle and Cartman walking to his house and meeting him there.

The Mole speaks with a heavy French accent, and often refers to other people as ""bitches"". His catchphrase is ""Shit!"", which in his accent actually sounds closer to ""Sheet!""

Christophe's Mother has long, straight brown hair with a hairband. She wears a white collared shirt under a blue and white sweater, with a long navy blue skirt. She also wears a white headband and tiny gold earrings.

She does not seem to have a very good relationship with her son, and according to Christophe, she had attempted to kill him by stabbing him in the heart with a clothes hanger. She does show strength over her son. Christophe appears to be intimidated by her, still listening to her. Christophe's mother does not agree or allow her son's misotheism, and grounds him for saying such things.

In ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"", Christopher Reeve comes to town to promote stem cell research.

Cinderella's appearance is accurate to her look in the film. She is a young pale-skinned strawberry-blonde woman and wears a blue ballgown, with opera gloves, a blue band in her hair, a blue choker, diamond earrings, and has her hair pulled into a bun. Some noticeable differences from her film version are that her dress is in more vibrant color and her choker is blue instead of black. She is first seen roughed up by the terrorist attack, with dirt and a few cuts on her dress and she eventually loses one of her earrings. She is lightly bleeding from her nose and mouth, dripping on to her dress. When Cinderella is revived, she is seen in pristine condition.

Clark Malkinson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Clark_Malkinson,,"is the father of [[Scott Malkinson]] who appears on [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode, ""[[Basic Cable]]"".

Scott asks Clark if he can get Disney+ at the breakfast table. However, he refuses as he believes cable is enough, and streaming services are going straight to hell. He is called on when the Stotch family has issues with their cable and is warned that they are losing customers because of their slow service, but Clark still procrastinates, going shopping and bowling before getting to the [[Stotch Residence|Stotch house]]. [[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] then says that they should get streaming services and Clark hits back, saying that streaming is destroying the town.

Scott then returns home after a day of school and tells his parents about his girlfriend, and says they need to get Disney+. Clark once again refuses, and, after mocking his son, calls up the [[Michael, Kurt, Bill, and Dave|other cable workers]] to arrange a meeting about the streaming services. Most of the cable workers arrive late, angering Clark. Clark then explains they were the ones who laid the cables for the companies and they should take them out. The group then split up to collect the parts, but procrastinate again instead of getting the parts, once again angering Clark.

Later on, as Scott and his friend, [[Sophie Gray|Sophie]] just starts to watch ''[[The Mandalorian]]'', Disney+ goes down just as he starts it, thanks to Clark and the other cable workers taking the cables out. However, when streaming rights are available in the town, the group turns up, only realizing its too late.

Clark has brown hair with a hairstyle, a mustache and a brown beard, some freckles on his cheeks, and is slightly overweight. Clark is only seen wearing a gray work uniform with a toolbelt.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he has balding, graying brown hair, a gray mustache, and unshaven beard. He wears a white undershirt, blue shorts, and black slippers with white socks. He also retains his toolbelt.

Scott is the son of Clark. They do not seem to have a good relationship. He was first mentioned in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"" when Scott explained to [[Mr. Mackey]] that his dad doubted he would really be able to quit Twitter as he was threatening. This was also shown in ""[[Basic Cable]]"", where Clark rejects Scott's request for a Disney+ subscription. They get into an argument, leading to Clark mocking Scott by saying ""My name is Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes"", in the same manner as [[Eric Cartman]].

She is Clark's wife. Not much is known about their relationship. Clark has shown to have a better relationship with his wife than with his son. In ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", they are seen arguing over whether they should let their son go to school.

Classi,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Classi,,"is a prostitute-for-hire. She made her first appearance in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"" as [[Nathan]]'s girlfriend.

</gallery>

Not much is known about Classi, other than her occupation. She does seem to be known by others, as [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] recognizes her at the gun show. According to her, her name is written with ""an I, and a little dick that hangs off the C that bends around and fucks the L out of ASS""; CLASS-I. She seems rich, as to owning an expensive ""CLASS-I-Mobile"".

Classi is dark-skinned and has a black/auburn Afro hair. She wears makeup, hoop earrings, golden bracelets, a low cut leopard-printed tank top, a denim miniskirt, and black strapped shoes. When seen from behind, part of her buttocks are exposed. She is also shown with a yellow belly button piercing.

Classi is dedicated to whomever pays her. She was Nathan's girlfriend, until he slapped her and told her to shut up, similarly to how he would treat [[Mimsy]]. She has strength as well, as she easily beats up Nathan during the breakup. But she is compassionate, as she unties [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and takes him to the gun show.

In ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", Nathan hired her to be his girlfriend with the money he received from helping [[Leslie Meyers|Leslie]] and the ads. Their relationship ended abruptly after she was slapped by him in a similar way to Mimsy, for which she violently assaulted him.

She does not have much of a relationship with Jimmy at first. However, after Nathan slaps her, she goes on to help Jimmy stop the advertisements. She teams up with him and [[Officer Barbrady]] at the gun show, in order to alert [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] about Leslie.

During [[The Bowels of the Beast]] mission, [[Captain Diabetes]] and [[the New Kid]] try to chase after Classi in the Peppermint Hippo. After fighting past other [[Strippers]], chefs of [[Buca De Faggoncini]] and [[Randy Marsh|Red Wine Drunk Randy]], Classi was finally surrounded by the [[Coon and Friends]] who then asked her of the missing cat Scrambles for its reward money. Initially reluctant to give them the information, but after the New Kid delivers her medication, she finally reveals that the missing cats are being hidden in [[U-STOR-IT]].

Later in [[The Thin White Line]] mission, she was almost fed to the elder god [[Shub-Niggurath]], being rescued just in time by the superheroes. Following the events in [[Park County Police Station]], she thanked the New Kid and offered to help them in combat, unlocking a Summon.

Cleo Broflovski,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Cleo_Broflovski,,"is the deceased mother of [[Sheila Broflovski]] that unusually shares her daughter's married name. Because of this, it can be assumed that it was [[Gerald Broflovski]] that took Sheila's surname.

[[File:Cleo-Tombstone.png|thumb|150px|left|[[The Boys|The boys]] about to dig up her grave.]]
She has only appeared on screen as a corpse in the [[Season Three|third season]] Halloween special, ""[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]"" when the boys dug her up in order to frighten the 5th Graders (who are now [[the 6th Graders]]). During the course of the episode, a dog ate the corpse, but later regurgitated it to the disgust of everyone at the Halloween festival. This is a parody of a scene in the cult horror-comedy film [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103873/ Braindead], in which a dying old woman regurgitates the body of a dog. Later, the boys managed to frighten the 5th Graders with her.

In ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"", [[Randy Marsh]], in an attempt to explain [[Mrs. Vladchik]]'s untimely death to [[Quintuplets|the girls]], had all the kids who had a grandmother step forward; only a saddened [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] did not forward, indirectly referring to the deceased Cleo.

In the [[Season Six|sixth season]] episode ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"" the psychic [[Wikipedia:John Edward|John Edward]] ""receives a message"" from Cleo for [[Kyle Broflovski]] stating that he is to look out for four white doves, which he sees at the New York Airport (having traveled there to feature on the show). Kyle sees the four white doves on an advert for a Jewish school named Jewleeard which he joins. After some convincing from [[Stan Marsh]] he finally realizes the psychic was just cold reading and returns to town stating that Cleo is ""dead and gone forever"".
[[File:Cleo_broflovski_in_her_coffin.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Cleo in her coffin.]]
In the episode ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"" when Stan and Kyle reach the clouds they look for heaven and Kyle exclaims, ""Grandma?""

In the episode ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"" it is revealed that Sheila had grown up in Newark, and that she and Gerald briefly lived there with her parents while she was pregnant with Kyle. It maybe assumed that Cleo might had moved to South Park; like her daughter, to escape from New Jersey.

Aside from Cleo Broflovski's appearance predominantly being that of a corpse, she appears to have gray hair and was buried wearing a gray gown with white, lacy trimmings.

Clyde Donovan,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Clyde_Donovan,,"and '''Clyde Harris''', is one of [[The Boys|the boys]]' classmates. His birthday is April 10 as seen on his [[Facebook]] profile page in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"". In ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"", it is revealed that [[Betsy Donovan|Clyde's mother]] is Dutch, and as such, he has at least some Dutch ancestry. Clyde is a member of [[Craig's Gang]].

In ""[[Wieners Out]]"", he joins Butters' movement and frequently pulls his pants down to reveal his genitals.

Clyde Donovan is a regular member of [[Craig's Gang]], along with [[Craig Tucker]], [[Jimmy Valmer]], and [[Tolkien Black]].

Clyde made his first appearance in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" as a background character in the third-grade class, seated in front of [[Pip Pirrip]].

Clyde Donovan has his first speaking role in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"" as an Indian in the South Park play being performed for [[Kathie Lee Gifford]]. During ""[[Clubhouses]]"", he begins dating [[Bebe Stevens]] and they briefly get back together in ""[[The List]]"".

In ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] comments that Clyde would have helped in getting [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] kidney for [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], but his appetite for tacos got in the way - referencing his weight, which had also been pointed out by Butters in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"".

In ""[[Lice Capades]]"", he thought at first that he was the only one in the school who had head lice. He did not want to reveal it or have it found out, because he feared he would be made fun of and embarrassed by Cartman and the rest of the class. However, Clyde's lice problem was not revealed to the others, as Kenny McCormick was accused by Cartman. This episode was the first time his last name was 'Harris', as stated at the lice inspection. However, in the later reruns, this was corrected.
[[File:MetrosexualClyde.jpg|thumb|Clyde as a metrosexual.]]
In ""[[The List]]"", Clyde is listed through a doctored list as the cutest person by the girls, becoming arrogant and narcissistic. It is revealed that he was only listed as such so that the girls could acquire free shoes from his father's shoe shop.

In ""[[Fatbeard]]"", Clyde decides to join Cartman's [[Pirate Club]] to live the life of a pirate. However, he is met with disappointment upon arrival in Somalia, observing the poor living conditions. Clyde eventually broke down into tears on two occasions.

In ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"", Clyde's habit of leaving the toilet up eventually led to the death of [[Betsy Donovan|his mother]]. The boys, believing that Clyde is not to blame for the incident, decide to assist Clyde and sue the [[Sir John Harington|inventor of the toilet]] through a ""sue-ance"". However, during the trial, the inventor reveals that the correct way to use the toilet is to sit inwards. Following this, Clyde begins to adopt the position, intentionally putting the toilet seat up after use and flipping off his mother.

Clyde Donovan has been seen as a good athlete and is interested in sports. He plays football for the South Park cows in ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"" and ""[[The Coon]]"" and continues to show support for the team throughout ""[[Douche and Turd]]"". He, however, becomes very upset with the name change and during the change back he is shown to wear the jersey under his clothes. He is also on the basketball team in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"" and was on the soccer team in ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"". 

He was seen playing baseball in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"" where he plays shortstop, which is usually the position of the best defensive player on a baseball team. Like all of the boys at [[South Park Elementary]], however, he hated the game and tried hard to lose it so they did not have to continue playing. Clyde is also a big fan of the [[Denver Broncos]], as seen in ""[[Marjorine]]"". In ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", a lamp with the Colorado Avalanches can be seen in his room, implying that he might be a hockey fan. Additionally, in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', hockey gloves are part of his costume.

[[File:Sideway Clyde.png|thumb|left|Playing basketball with Stan.]]
He has medium-brown hair, wears a burgundy coat with blue trim, dark-gray pants, and sometimes wears mittens. Underneath, he has been shown to wear a green T-shirt with a cow's face on the front. On occasion, he is seen wearing a red and white sports jacket that looks similar to his usual coat. He has been labeled ""the second fattest kid next to Cartman"" despite appearing about the same weight as the others. He has a somewhat nasal voice, similar to that of Craig's, but lighter.

In ""[[Ginger Kids]]"", Clyde is shown in his pajamas, which consist of green pants and a collared, green shirt with a dinosaur on the left breast pocket.

In ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"", it is rumored that Clyde only has one testicle, though this is never actually confirmed.

In ""[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]"", Clyde is announced as having a colostomy by [[Mr. Mackey]], and as such was incapable of and therefore innocent of defecating into a urinal. However, this appears to have been retconned in ""[[Lice Capades]]"", ""[[The List]]"", and ""[[Wieners Out]]"", as he is shown without a colostomy bag/pouch, a [https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/colostomy-stoma stoma], or any visuals that would imply him having had a colostomy. This could also just be a detail they forgot about when making the episodes.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Adult Clyde has brown eyebrows, a chin, and a nose. He also wears a beige Hawaiian t-shirt with brown hibiscus and pineapple detail, dark gray shorts, and blue sneakers. He also carries a golden watch on his left wrist.

Clyde is not very clever, or at least not good at mathematics, and is often portrayed as one of the less intelligent members of the class. When his [[Herbert Garrison|teacher]] asks him what two times five equals, he guesses twelve - Garrison then referred to him as ""a complete retard"". Or when he writes a poor essay in another essay on why people need to recycle. However, considering that Mr. Garrison never actually ''teaches'' the kids, it's probably not Clyde's fault.

He has a habit of sobbing uncontrollably whenever he witnesses something upsetting. Examples of this are when he hears Cartman singing in ""[[Fourth Grade]]"" when the adults decide to give all of the money they would have spent on Christmas presents for their kids to the [[:Category:Broflovski / Schwartz Family|Broflovskis]] in ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", and when he realizes that there was no crystal clear lagoons, treasure, and plunder after he joined Cartman's ""Somalian pirate club"" in ""[[Fatbeard]]"". This usually gets an angry response from Cartman.

On several occasions when things get surreal in the show, Clyde shows little or no interest. For instance, when the boys' audition for a new fourth friend, and he is eliminated as a candidate, he eventually decides that it is stupid and shows no actual interest in being their fourth friend. Also, while everyone else is obsessing over the [[World of Warcraft]] game, he questions its importance and reads ''Playboy'' instead, which causes the ""[[Jenkins|rogue]]"" to defeat the other players once again. During ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"" he does his homework instead of listening to the murder of [[Gordon Stoltski]] on the intercom.

Clyde seems to know a lot about movies. He has Lord of the Rings on DVD in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"". Other examples are in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"" and ""[[The List]]"".

Clyde appears to be one of the nicer boys, or at least he has a better sense of morality at times. In ""[[The Cissy]]"" Clyde is the only student in the whole school that stands up for Stan against Eric Cartman's bullying by telling him to ""lay off"". In ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", he appeared to be shocked at himself when he said ""I'm not fat, goddammit!"" while filling in for Cartman as the fat kid. In ""[[Lice Capades]]"", he refused to sock bathe [[Kenny McCormick]] when Kenny is accused of having head lice since Clyde believed himself to be the only one who had lice. He also notified Ms. Garrison to stop the sock bathing and tried to delay the other boys until it arrived, when it is revealed that all the kids had head lice, this means Clyde is the only boy who felt guilty for dumping the target for having head lice onto Kenny, whereas all the other boys never contacted Mr. Garrison or showed even a bit of remorse. Clyde can as well be seen defending Cartman in ""[[Marjorine]]"". In ""[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]"", Clyde even tried to take the fall for the person who took a crap in the urinal. In ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"", Clyde mentions that he takes the time to read the terms and conditions on the Apple store so that he knows what he is agreeing to.
[[File:TheList039.png|thumb|left|Clyde admiring himself in ""[[The List]]"".]]
In ""[[The List]]"", when Clyde is listed on the corrupted list as best looking, he becomes arrogant and narcissistic. But he is still somewhat caring towards the others as he attempts to make [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] feel better for being listed last, though does it carelessly.

Clyde seems to have a liking for adult-related materials. In the episode ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", he is seen reading a ''Playboy'' magazine instead of playing the game, and in ""[[Ginger Kids]]"", the topic of his presentation is mentioned as ""lesbian cheerleaders."" In the episode ""[[Marjorine]]"", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] says that one of her hobbies is, ""''getting my snootch pounded on Friday nights,''"" to which Clyde responds ""Nice."", although he could also have been happy with how well the idea had turned out - judging by his tone, this was not the case.

In ""[[Lice Capades]]"", Clyde was extremely ashamed of having head lice, even going so far as to tell a little girl at the doctor's clinic that he had [[AIDS]] to avoid being found out.

In ""[[Marjorine]]"", Clyde stood up for Cartman when Kyle and Stan were ridiculing him for his discovery of the girls' future-telling device. This surprised many of the boys who were in Cartman's basement at the time, including Cartman himself. Although this initially indicates that he is somewhat on Cartman's side, he ignores him along with the rest of the class in ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"". He may have only been curious about the future telling device Cartman was reporting and wanted Stan and Kyle to be quiet while Cartman explained. He might also still feel loyalty towards Cartman for returning to South Park in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", evidenced by his willingness to accept Cartman as a leader, such as when he joined his crew in ""[[Fatbeard]]"". He also seems to be much more willing than the other kids to accept Cartman's bigoted views, possibly because he agrees with Cartman on occasion, saying [[Ginger Separatist Movement|ginger kids]] creeped him out in ""[[Ginger Kids]]"".

[[File:CrackBabyAthleticAssociation070.png|thumb|left|Roger and Betsy Donovan.]] He told the environmentalists in ""[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]"" that his father, like [[Randy Marsh]], is a geologist, though [[Roger Donovan|Mr. Donovan]] is only shown with Clyde alongside his mother. The couple appears again in the Atheists Club in ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"", leading us to believe that Clyde's family, like most of South Park's residents, is Roman Catholic. He has a dog named [[Rex|Rex Donovan]], who had a sexual encounter with Stan's dog, [[Sparky|Sparky Marsh]]. His mother is referred to as [[Betsy Donovan|Martha]] in ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"". His name suggests Irish or Scottish ancestry, however, his mother is Dutch, as revealed in ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"".

In the [[Season Eleven|season eleven]] finale, ""[[The List]]"", it is revealed that his father owns a shoe shop. The girls declared him the cutest boy in South Park Elementary so that they could have easier shoe-shopping sprees. However, as mentioned above, Mr. Donovan was supposedly a geologist. Of course, he may have more than one job, or he may have quit geology since ""[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]"", and took up a career as a shoe store owner. Another version of this goof is that he is not Clyde's real father at all.

The Donovan family apparently sold their house and moved to another as of the [[Season Eight]] episode ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", as it is mentioned that [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jefferson]] bought ""the Donovans' old house"".

In the episode ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"", shortly before her death, Clyde's mother mentions that he has a sister, asking him to put the toilet seat down from now on for his sister's sake.

Clyde's last name appeared on merchandise during the first few seasons as 'Clyde Goodman', but this name was never used on the show. During ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"", he was referred to as Clyde Donovan during a news segment, yet a few seasons later during ""[[Lice Capades]]"" the nurse asks him ""Clyde... Harris, is it?"" and while it may have been a mistake on her part, later airings corrected the line to Donovan. In ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"" on Facebook his name is changed back to 'Clyde Donovan'.

[[File:CrackBabyAthleticAssociation075.png|thumb|left|Craig and Clyde working for Cartman.]]
Clyde seems to get along with Craig quite well. He even seems to lead [[Craig's Gang]] from time to time, even though Craig is the confirmed leader. Normally, though, the two just hang around with each other. The two are often seen with each other, showing that they are likely good friends.

Clyde and Craig are seen together in several episodes, whether they are sitting next to each other or just talking to each other. In ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"", they are seen working together for Cartman to look for [[Slash]]. In ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"", they play [[Texans vs. Mexicans]] on Cartman's side to prevent ""Mexicans"" from passing their border (which they, unfortunately, fail in doing). In [[Elementary School Musical]], they eat together in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|school cafeteria]]. In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", they are cheer while watching Cartman and Wendy's fight. In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Clyde hugs Craig when they rekindle their friendship. In ""[[Lice Capades]]"", Craig tells Clyde to bring a bar of soap and a sock to beat Kenny up. Because of this, many fans see them as best friends like Stan and Kyle.

Their names are sometimes mixed up as shown in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"" and they have nearly identical nasally voices. This was also noted in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' when after you talk to Craig after he replaces Clyde as the owner of the armory, he will say he was given that role because the Grand Wizard Cartman said he sounds like Clyde, he denies that however.

In ''The Stick of Truth'', Craig joins Clyde's Army of Darkness as his second-in-command.

Tolkien and Clyde appear to be good friends. They are usually seen talking to each other in background scenes and both form the core of Craig's group.

[[File:TheList044.png|thumb|Clyde with Kyle.]] Clyde and Kyle get along well normally. In ""[[The List]]"" when Clyde had been voted the cutest boy in class and Kyle had been voted the ugliest, Clyde still tried to comfort Kyle - even though he was being a bit condescending at the time. However, Kyle did hurl abuse at Clyde during their sledding competition in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"" for being fat, although since he was replacing Cartman at the time, this was to be expected. In the episode ""[[A Boy And A Priest]]"", when Clyde is having his birthday party, he is seen talking with Kyle. Also on Clyde's birthday in the same episode, Kyle was sitting right next to him.

[[File:TheDeathofEricCartman (25).png|thumb|Clyde with Cartman.]] Clyde usually shows little or no interest in the antics of Cartman. However, he does join in from time to time, usually as a result of everyone else joining in as well - such as his leprechaun hunt in ""[[Imaginationland]]"", his membership of the superhero group [[Coon and Friends]]. There was one occasion when Clyde vehemently stood up for Cartman when Kyle and Stan failed to believe him in ""[[Marjorine]]"", which shocked everyone present. It is implied that Clyde is somewhat easy to manipulate as he does usually end up following Cartman's lead on his various schemes.

There are other times, though, when Clyde will be distracted from Cartman's schemes - when most of the 4th grade had been recruited to help take down [[Jenkins]] on World of Warcraft in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", Clyde was more interested in a Playboy magazine. He was a part of Cartman's pirate crew in ""[[Fatbeard]]"" and worked for Cartman in ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"".

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"" Clyde along with Stan, Kyle, Butters, Tolkien, Craig, and Jimmy smashes all of Cartman's electronics due to them thinking that he is [[Skankhunt42]].

As of ""[[White People Renovating Houses]]"", Cartman appears to have forgiven Clyde as well as the boys for breaking his stuff, as he is no longer isolated from them rejoined their circle.

It appears that Cartman has a strong hatred for Clyde, as shown by his ""Shit List"" in ""[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole|The Fractured But Whole]]"" where he placed Clyde 3rd for his most hated person, after Kyle and [[Liane Cartman]] respectively.

[[File:ClybePair-1-.png|thumb|Bebe with Clyde.]]
In the episode ""[[Clubhouses]]"" Bebe has to break the news to Kyle that they can only be friends and then Bebe says ""Okay, let's go Clyde."" Bebe also uses the corrupted list in ""[[The List]]"" to make Clyde popular, so that she can go out with him and justify getting free shoes from the shoe store that Clyde's dad owns at the [[South Park Mall]].

In ""[[The List]]"", after being placed at #1 on the girls' ""cutest boys"" list, Clyde briefly starts going out with Red before breaking up with her in favor of Bebe. Although Clyde seemed to have been romantically interested in her, it seems as though Red was only using him for the sake of getting free shoes, so it cannot be interpreted that she ''actually'' liked him.

Clyde and Millie were paired up in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"". The two are often shown together at school assemblies, implying that they are relatively close friends.

After seeing a photoshopped image of Lisa going from overweight to beautiful, Clyde starts dating her, believing that her appearance actually transformed to how she is depicted in said photoshopped image. The two are shown to be rather appreciative of one another's company.

Clyde is seen crying after a recent breakup in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", although whether this was with Lisa or someone else is unknown.

They have not been seen together much, other than in the background at the school dance in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"". Additionally, Annie also kindly greets Clyde as he confidently walks down the hallway after becoming the most popular boy at school.

Clyde was originally used as a background character and served as one of the first recurring background characters alongside [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. In [[Season Four]], he was given a lasting personality and gradually became one of the primary members of [[the boys]]' class in [[Season Six]] and onward. He is sometimes overshadowed by [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] or [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], whom he is shown to be close friends with. He has notably spoken in multiple episodes in every season to date, as well as [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|the movie]] and several video games.
[[File:ClydesDebut.jpg|thumb|right|Clyde's debut.]]
Clyde plays a small role in the storyline of ''South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!'' and appears at the end of the ""[[Sixth Graders]]' Hangout"" level to inform the player that [[Tuong Lu Kim]] is looking for them to help protect his City Wall and defeat the villains. They ask him to help but he tells them he does not care. In gameplay, he is of the same class as [[Stan Marsh]], [[Butters Stotch]] and [[Jimmy Valmer]], doing average damage, speed, and range, and his special ability involves tossing his [[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce|colostomy bag]] out and causing damage to enemies within a small radius.

Clyde appears in ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' as the secondary antagonist of the game.

Clyde first appears as a member of the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]] as a warrior under the rule of [[Eric Cartman]]. Clyde is the first person that fights with the player to learn the battle mechanics. After the elves invade the kingdom, Clyde informs them that they have taken the [[Stick of Truth|stick]], which he was supposed to guard. As a result of this, Cartman banishes him ""from space and time"", preventing him from playing with them, and he angrily leaves.

Clyde is not seen again until the end of the battle of humans against elves. After they discover the Stick was not at the school, they find a message that leads them to Clyde's locker, where they find a laptop that is in a video call with him. Clyde reveals that he is in the possession of the Stick and has formed a new army to get revenge on his friends for kicking him out of the game. Clyde also reveals that he has a barrel containing green goo, which he uses to turn animals into [[Nazi Zombies]] soldiers. The boys go to his house but their attack fails as they are outnumbered and all the boys are sent to their houses due to being past their curfew.

After [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s army has greatly grown in number, they launch an assault on [[Clyde's Fortress|Clyde's fortress]]. When they get to his throne room, Clyde uses the goo to revive [[Chef]] as a Nazi Zombie. After he is defeated, Clyde surrenders. Cartman takes back the Stick and kicks him off the treehouse to the ground.

Clyde's personality in the game is one of a power-hungry dark lord after he is banished by Cartman. He is also apparently not very discerning when it comes to the use of the green goo. While he is effective in using it to create a Nazi Zombie army, he firmly believes the Government's cover story that it is Taco Bell green sauce, and attributes its strange properties to its ingredients.

It was known as Eric's most favorite toy, as evidenced in ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"", where he says a tearful farewell to Clyde Frog before he goes on a dangerous mission. 

In some episodes, when Eric was alone, he would ask Clyde Frog for advice, and he seems to have seen the stuffed animal as a friend as seen in ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"". 

[[File:1201 killing clyde frog.jpg|Clyde Frog on South Park Studios.|thumb|left]]
Clyde Frog first appeared in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"". He was one of the stuffed animals at a tea party in Cartman's backyard. When Clyde Frog was asked by Eric what he thought about him, his reply was ""I think you're a big fat piece of crap"". In the episode ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"" he is seen in Mayor Cartman's office, and in the episode ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", in the toy grab machine at [[Michael Jackson|Mr. Jefferson's]] house you can see Clyde frog inside it in many scenes. Clyde Frog was torn apart in ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"", when an enraged [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] ripped Clyde's head off as payback when finding out that Cartman had infected him with [[AIDS|HIV]], but Clyde Frog makes an appearance in-tact in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"". In [[South Park: The Complete Fourteenth Season|Season Fourteen DVD]], Clyde Frog was in a deleted scene for ""[[201]]"". He is also seen in the basement in ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"".

He ends up dying in the episode ""[[1%]]"". 

In ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', Clyde Frog is the trophy given to the player if they get a silver medal.

Clyde Frog ""died"" in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode ""[[1%]]"". He was murdered at the hands of Cartman, who pretended it was [[Polly Prissypants]], after he was told to grow up and ""killed"" all of his stuffed dolls in a very dramatic way. He was the first out of Cartman's toys to ""die"".

Clyde Frog is an anthropomorphic, stuffed frog. He has a green body, a pink mouth, and a red tongue. In ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", and in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", Clyde Frog's body was colored differently, it was more gray than green.

As founder and owner of the KFC company, Colonel Sanders was not pleased to discover that his fast-food restaurants were outlawed as a result of a new Colorado State law that forbade the KFC stores to sell their product in low-income areas. As a result, all the KFCs in Colorado were shut down and replaced with medicinal marijuana stores for the ill, and the Colonel began taking a page out of the book of drug dealers and using assorted means, shipping his products illegally into Colorado.

He initially worked with a boy named [[Billy Miller]] and met with Billy's representatives [[Tommy (""Medicinal Fried Chicken"")|Tommy]] and [[Eric Cartman]]. The Colonel took an immediate liking to Cartman because he saw no 'lie' in his eyes. Tommy on the other hand was not as fortunate, and was apparently working secretly for the ""Naked Chef"" [[Jamie Oliver]], and was killed by hanging him from a helicopter. The Colonel then agreed to do business with Cartman's organization under the sole-rule that Cartman NEVER ""fuck with him"".

Cartman later took over the South Park cartel and was also given the task of assassinating James Oliver from attending a United Nations meeting. Unfortunately, due to his addiction to KFC, Cartman refuses to distribute any more of the products to anyone else, ignoring the Colonel's orders of killing Jamie Oliver. Furious at Cartman's failure, the Colonel ordered a hit against Cartman and his KFC trafficking group. Unfortunately, his men met opposition with the police, and Cartman escaped death. Despite being unable to kill Cartman, the Colonel regained his fast-food foothold in Colorado when KFC was legalized once again.

Colonel Sanders wears his characteristic white linen suit and black string bow tie. He has white hair and white facial hair. He wears black glasses, black shoes, and walks with a black cane featuring a metal handle. He is also visibly aged.

Coon and Friends,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Coon_and_Friends,,"was a superhero team formed by [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] to fight crime in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] in the hopes of building a franchise.

The original team first appeared in the episodes, ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"". They later returned and expanded in ""[[Franchise Prequel]]"", only for the team to be torn apart by different franchise plans, a battle that was the primary focus of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

The final team lineup consisted of The Coon, [[Human Kite]], [[Mosquito]], [[Fastpass]], [[Super Craig]], and [[Captain Diabetes]] before they were absorbed by the [[Freedom Pals]].

Amid an alleged crime wave, in town, the the Coon brought together eight heroes including himself at an elaborate headquarters constructed in [[Cartman Residence|his basement]] to form a team that could combat the rise in crime, offering them access to his resources, which are largely common household items, including basic equipment and electronics such as televisions and computers, with added Coon-branding. They had access to a ""Coon Mobile"", driven by [[Liane Cartman]] and more; however, members were asked to pay unspecified dues and fees for membership to enjoy these services. Only two members of the team were known to possess real superpowers, [[Mysterion]] and [[Mintberry Crunch]].

Their first mission was to help rescue people from a burning building, but the firemen, who were already there, keep them away from the scene for their safety. [[Captain Hindsight]] then arrives, tells the firemen what they did wrong, and leaves. The firemen consider the problem solved, and drive home, leaving 14 people to burn. The people's admiration for Hindsight enrages the Coon, who becomes obsessed with forcibly recruiting Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends, planning to dress [[Butters Stotch]] as Courtney Love and faking provocative photos of the two.

The group then attempts to help the victims of the DP oil spill, planning to sell lemon bars at a bake sale to raise money, however this gets set back when the Coon beats up Mosquito and Mintberry Crunch. The Coon is kicked out of the group by a unanimous vote for this and then grounded by his mom for beating up his friends and swearing soon thereafter.

In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", they proceed with the bake sale, gaining plenty of press attention and making some money for charity. Mysterion becomes the de facto leader, although it is presumed they take on a democratic vote, as suggested by Mosquito in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"". They decide to keep the name 'Coon and Friends' specifically to spite the Coon, which Mysterion finds greatly amusing. The Coon, meanwhile, forms a new organization under the same name by teaming up with [[Cthulhu]], printing matching 'Coon and Friends' T-shirts for only the two of them.

In ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", the Coon returns to town and implores Cthulhu to banish the members of Coon and Friends at Coon's command, to the [[City of R'Lyeh]], though Mintberry Crunch manages to run home before the banishment proceeds. Mysterion manages to escape by committing suicide and being reborn in the real world, while the others remain there waiting for help. They are ultimately rescued by Mintberry Crunch and brought back to the real world thanks to Mysterion.

The Coon and Friends reassemble in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, ""[[Franchise Prequel]]"", hoping to kick off a superhero franchise. Fastpass wins an audition to join the team after telling them his superhero origin story, while [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], with [[Mark Zuckerberg]]'s support, creates fake 'news' about the Coon and Friends group on Facebook ruining their reputation and keeping Netflix from greenlighting their superhero franchise. Super Craig is seen as a member of the group for the first time here, with [[Wonder Tweek]] appearing briefly at the end and [[Scott Malkinson]] is also mentioned to be a member.

While Zuckerberg is trespassing into the town, Fastpass runs around him, providing a distraction for Tupperware, and fires bursts of energy at him, to which Zuckerberg fires back in his mind but misses every shot. The Human Kite then punches him in the crotch, sending him to the ground. He is subsequently attacked by all the remaining members of the Coon and Friends.

Zuckerberg stands up, and the Coon and Friends dramatically fall to the ground. The Coon announces to the citizens on site that Zuckerberg had attacked innocent children who were simply trying to save black lives, and simultaneously support Jews, and crippled people. Zuckerberg is thwarted by the Coon and Friends and is forced to take down [[Facebook]], ruining Professor Chaos's plan.

Despite this, the group separates at the end of the episode due to petty franchise differences, introducing a major conflict that would be revisited in the [[South Park]] video game, ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

As of the end of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', the team is defunct and has merged into [[Freedom Pals]]. Below was the lineup of the team at the time of the merger.

They are seen most often as background characters. They are the mascot for the [[South Park Elementary]] sport teams.

</gallery>

In ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", alien [[Visitors]] are turning cows inside out. 
The Cows repeatedly try to escape a seemingly imminent death, but they are thwarted every time. At the end of the episode the cows find out that Carl, a Visitor new to his job, had only mutilated the cows by accident. The aliens also explain that cows are the most intelligent animals on the planet before handing them a gift. The gift is capable of zapping anyone into singing ""I love to singa!"" by Owl Jolson from a Merry Melodies short.

In ""[[Cow Days]]"", a county fair is held in honor of the cows. A giant cow shaped memorial clock is presented to the townsfolk which begins the annual ""Running of the Cows"", where the cattle stampede through [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] chasing the townsfolk.

They kept them locked in Stan's room with them to prevent them from being killed, causing a dramatic media stir, and briefly turning the boys into vegetarians.

In ""[[Ginger Cow]]"", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] turns one unsuspecting cow into a ginger to fool the other children at school into believing that other animals besides humans can have light skin, red hair, and freckles.

The cows of South Park all resemble typical dairy cattle. They usually have a combination of black, brown, or white fur, and pink udders. The cows have traditional South Park-styled eyes and short horns. In later seasons, the cows are slightly redesigned to resemble more realistic cows. However, the South Park Cows cow, Mooy, still retains the original design of the cows from earlier seasons.

Although its canonicity is disputed, cows are minor villains in the video game ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' on the opening level Stan's House. They are slow moving, easily defeated and drop more coins than other characters. They do not reappear in any other levels.

Cows appear as a cameo in the lockers as posters in the doors, they also have their own card.

In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", their plans of taking over the world, by making everyone metrosexual, are revealed to [[Kyle Broflovski]]. Their goal was to make all the men weak, so an invasion would be easy, due to them being small and weak themselves. If they are unable to force people to be metrosexual, they dress them up in typical Crab People garb, claiming that this makes them one of them. The TV producers said they did it before on the ''Jeffersons''.

In ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"", [[Eric Cartman]] suggested Crab People while brainstorming ideas for a news show.

They were also mentioned at the end of ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"", where they were blamed for destroying the [[Beaverton]] dam.

In ""[[Basic Cable]]"", they made a brief appearance with their own show during the random streaming series scene.

Crab People are anthropomorphic crabs, vaguely resembling anthropomorphized coconut crabs in appearance. They vary in color and have biological crab features, such as antennae, claws, and crab shells. In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", they take on human disguises, disguising themselves as the cast of '''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy''', which they do with using highly realistic skin and bodysuits

The Crab people are evil creatures whose intention is world domination, which they seek through the manipulation and corruption of mankind. They are also a highly intelligent and advanced species, being able to cunningly trick humans into believing their various schemes and fads, allowing them to destroy societies. They are also rather elaborate and extravagant in nature, often enjoying ritualistic chanting and taking great pleasure and enjoyment in the sly art of impersonating humans and their behaviors.

'''''South Park is Gay!'''''
Crab People appear as villains on several levels. They are most easily defeated with the Firey-Works tower, making them rather weak and easy to defeat, but they make up for this in numbers and speed, often moving to the end of the level quickly.

Their lair can be found through the sewers. Chanting is heard throughout the cavern. During the beta, Crab People were originally meant to have their own boss fight but were scrapped for unknown reasons.

Crab people are first encountered during the quest [[(You Can) Call on Me]], where [[the New Kid]] and [[Call Girl]] discover that they have taken over the [[D-Mobile]] store. They attempt to pass themselves off as normal human employees, but Call Girl quickly sees through their charade and engages them in combat, eventually killing the manager, King Crab, forcing the remaining crab people to flee the store. After their defeat, they reappear fighting alongside the other enemies the New Kid has made throughout the game ambushing the New Kid during the quest [[To Catch a Coon]] as they leave [[Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse|Tweek Bros. Coffee]]. They can later be found and fought near [[Stark's Pond]] and [[South Park Church]].

There, he bumps into [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] who is also volunteering. Kyle follows him and sees that he, [[Craig Tucker|Craig]], [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] have gathered together to form [[Crack Baby Athletic Association (CBAA)|a new business]] that takes the crack babies and makes them fight each other for a small crack rock. At first, Kyle is shocked and horrified at what Cartman has done, and that he is going to tell on him. However, after seeing and noting the amount of money Cartman's company has made, Kyle eventually joins in and works with them.

They work to turn the crack baby fights into a legitimate sport. Cartman attempts to cut a deal with [[EA Sports]] for a video game, while Craig and Clyde struggle to find the musician [[Slash]] to get him to play halftime at EA Sports' upcoming game. Kyle convinces Cartman to spend 30% of the money from the deal on a state-of-the-art [[South Park Orphanage for Crack Babies|orphanage for the crack babies]]. However, EA Sports ultimately screws the group out of the entire business and refuses to pay them anything, causing Kyle to be unable to build the orphanage. However, at the end of the episode, the orphanage has been built anyways, though it was never revealed who paid for it to be built.

The crack babies wear only diapers. They have large, more realistic eyes with large colored irises. They appear thin, emaciated, and sickly. Some have spare strings of hair while others have full heads of hair and some wear beanies.

Craig wears a blue jacket and a matching blue chullo hat with a yellow puffball on top. He wore yellow mittens in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"". In the early seasons of the series, he wore blue jeans, but in more recent seasons, he wears high-waisted black pants. His legs are longer than those of the other children, a fact which is visible in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", in which he and three other boys from his class wear identical clothes but Craig's pants appear much longer than the others.

In ""[[T.M.I.]]"", he is listed to have grown the most in height out of all the boys, along with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], all three gaining 2.4 inches. This implies that he may be one of the tallest (if not the tallest) boys in the class, especially since he appeared to be taller than the others even before his growth. One of the reasons he may be tall is that both his parents are shown to be the tallest adults in the town.

In ""[[The List]]"" it is mentioned that to place Clyde 1st in the list, they had to move Craig to 12th place. Therefore, in the [[Forum:The 'Real List'|real list]], Craig was chosen as the ""cutest boy"" in class.

Craig's hair is usually shown to be black, although it appeared to be brown in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"" and ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''. In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", Craig's eyes are shown to be blue. It is revealed in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"" that he is fairly thin. His nasal voice is similar to [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] but was originally higher in pitch. However, in later seasons (most noticeable since ""[[Pandemic]]""), his voice has been lowered to a similar pitch to Clyde.

A few times in the early seasons, he is seen wearing a green hat in the background. This has been corrected in later airings. An example that is still visible is in ""[[Fat Camp]]"", in which he appears in the lunch line his hat turns green for a few seconds as the camera moves. A green-attired Craig can also be seen in ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", though some believe that this may be a different character entirely. Nevertheless, the green chullo cap made a brief appearance in ""[[Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special]]"".

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Craig appears as an adult man. He appears a lot like his father with a similar chin, nose, and balding hair pattern, although his hair is black and straighter. He also wears a blue shirt with a darker blue color and brown shoulder pads, and brown Sperry shoes.

[[File:Craig.jpg|thumb|Craig's image on the official site, portraying him giving the middle finger.]]
Craig seems to be the most stoic, cynical, apathetic, and deadpan kid in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], having a more abrasive personality than the rest of the characters, a trait exaggerated by his deeper-than-average voice. He has been described as pragmatic, monotone, and sarcastic. He also appears to be more logical and mature than some of his peers, typically being the one to call them out on their ignorance. He generally prefers to be left alone, harboring very few but simple interests. In the making of [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]], it was written on a whiteboard that he only cares about his [[Stripe|guinea pig]], and his boyfriend, [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]].

Craig is implied to have bad behavior, and is referred to as ""the biggest trouble-maker"" in his class by [[Eric Cartman]] in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"". Craig has a habit of flipping people off, sometimes to express irritation, anger, or disdain towards them, sometimes as a reflex. This is a trait the official ''South Park'' website states is learned from his family,Craig's grandmother, who appears in flashbacks in ""Pandemic 2: The Startling"", gave Craig $100 for his birthday. She is yet to have any speaking lines as she appears only in a still picture. She appears to be a very loving grandmother.

In ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"", as [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] is walking around South Park, looking sorrowfully at the others, he walks past the [[Wikipedia:Welfare|Welfare office]]. Craig and his parents are shown stepping out of the office at the same time. While Tolkien may have been exaggerating in his thoughts about how poor everyone else in town is, this might imply that Craig's parents are jobless, or that their jobs do not provide enough income for them to get by on it alone.

It is hinted in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"" that he does not have a good relationship with his parents when Cartman says that he helped Craig get revenge on his parents for an unknown reason. He also states in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"" and ""[[The Poor Kid]]"" that he does not care if his mother is insulted. At the same time, his parents are shown to love him deeply, as they are each openly concerned when Craig is kidnapped in ""[[Pandemic]]"", and are delighted to have him back at the end of ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"". 

Not much is known of Craig's relationship with his mom but she is shown to be a caring mother. She scolded her husband when he responded to Craig's school fight with an apathetic ""oh"". She was shown to be neutral at the start of his relationship with Tweek in ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"" and in The Fractured But Whole encourages the player to get them back together.

The relationship between Craig and [[Thomas Tucker|his dad]] was explored briefly in ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"" where he originally was shown to have a slightly strained relationship with Thomas Tucker who was shown to be traditionally conservative and unhappy with rumors of his son being gay. Thomas later comes to accept Craig as he was and encourages his son to do what makes him happy and that he was proud of him. This was what led Craig to decide to rekindle his relationship with Tweek but this time for himself instead of for the town.

The relationship between her and Craig is difficult to decipher. She shares the family behavior of flipping people off with her middle finger. She appears to be fond of Tweek, calling Craig a fuckboy and asking [[The New Kid]] to help get Tweek and her brother back together after they had a falling out. She has also stated that if Tweek and Craig ever had a kid she would be a cool aunt.

Stripe is Craig’s pet guinea pig. His first on-screen appearance is in [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]. Craig has a very strong love for his guinea pig(s) and does not like it when Stripe is insulted. It was stated in a relationship chart done during the making of ''The Fractured But Whole'' that his guinea pig and Tweek are the only two things Craig cares about. Based on Craig's dialogue in ''The Fractured But Whole'', the current Stripe is Stripe #4, which was purchased by Tweek and they share ownership of. It is also known that Stripe #1 died after his mom accidentally stepped on it, breaking its back and Stripe #3 might have been poisoned by [[Thomas Tucker|his dad]] after it pooped in the dining room.

[[File:304 laid-up.gif|thumb|Craig in the hospital after fighting [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]].]]
In ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", [[The Boys|the main boys]], on account of a bet they had made, claim to Tweek and Craig that each had insulted the other, and convinced them to fight. When it turns out neither of them knows how to fight, they have them trained for it. Craig is trained in Sumo wrestling by Cartman. After the fight, both boys are hospitalized, but the kids fool them into fighting again. It is possible, however, that this fight brought the two boys closer together, as they are seen together on very many occurrences in later episodes.

In later seasons, Tweek and Craig can be seen standing side by side in various episodes including ""[[Ginger Kids]]"", where they are trapped in a cage together, and in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", where they are on the same side of the town. 

In ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"", the new female Asian students draw Yaoi pictures of Tweek and Craig in love, despite the two not being together. To stop the drawings, the two-stage a ""breakup"" in front of the school to stop the pictures, but Tweek goes too far in his role and makes Craig out to be a cheater by inventing a ""Michael"" that Craig cheated on for dramatic effect. This crushes the town's spirits, so the two reconcile to appease the town. The two are now in a genuine relationship.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, ""[[Put It Down]]"", Tweek stresses over nuclear bomb threats made by North Korea. Craig suggests that he make cupcakes for them, and this works until President Garrison insists that Tweek had pooped in the cupcake batter. Craig tries his best to make Tweek feel better. He gives him fidget spinners to fix his anxiety and gives him logical answers to his problem, which only makes things worse. But after hearing Heidi's speech about grieving, he comforts Tweek and talks with him about how he is feeling, helping him truly feel better.

Although their initial relationship appeared only to be to keep the town happy, following the events of ""Tweek x Craig"", the two have grown closer. In ""[[Put It Down]]"", Craig calls Tweek the affectionate pet names ""babe"" and ""honey"", even when no one is around, implying their relationship is now genuine. They are also often seen holding hands (""[[Put It Down]]"", ""[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"", and ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"").

Tolkien has always been a member of [[Craig's Gang]] (even when Clyde is not present) and the two are often seen next to each other. They do not have many onscreen interactions and have only been seen talking to each other in ""[[Jewpacabra]]"" and ""[[Raising the Bar]]"". It seems that Craig mostly hangs out with Tolkien and Clyde.

[[File:Untitled-1 copy.jpg|thumb|Craig, and Clyde in ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"".]]
Clyde is a member of Craig's gang, with Clyde sometimes leading the group. The two are sometimes seen standing beside each other in the background, which indicates that the two may be best friends. It seems that Craig mostly hangs out with Clyde.

[[File:Craig&Clyde.png|left|thumb|Craig and Clyde in the future device in ""[[Marjorine]]"".]] 
Clyde and Craig are seen together in several episodes, whether they are sitting next to each other or just talking to each other. In ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"", they are seen working together for Cartman to look for [[Slash]]. In ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"", they play [[Texans vs. Mexicans]] on Cartman's side to prevent ""Mexicans"" from passing their border (which they, unfortunately, fail in doing). In [[Elementary School Musical]], they eat together in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|school cafeteria]]. In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", they are cheer while watching Cartman and Wendy's fight. In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Clyde hugs Craig when they rekindle their friendship. In ""[[Lice Capades]]"", Craig tells Clyde to bring a bar of soap and a sock to beat Kenny up. Because of this, many fans see them as best friends like Stan and Kyle.

Their names are sometimes mixed up, as shown in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"", and they have nearly identical nasally voices, which Cartman tells Craig in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth|The Stick of Truth]]'', but Craig disagrees with. Craig is usually the straight man to Clyde's funny man personality.

Stan and Craig are somewhat rivals in episodes ""[[Pandemic]]"", ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"", as they both fight because Craig is upset that they took his $100. In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", they both argue that Craig is gayer than [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. Stan and Craig generally do not hang out. Furthermore, Stan's parents and Kyle's parents agree on preventing their kids from associating with Craig because Craig is seen as a big troublemaker and having a bad influence on Stan and Kyle in ""Pandemic"". Despite the rough points, they seem to be on better terms later in the series as seen in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", where Craig is attending Stan's birthday party and is seen smiling while there.

[[File:Pandemic012.png|thumb|Convincing Craig to join the boys' Peruvian flute band]]
Although Craig and Kyle do not hang out much with each other, they can often be seen sitting at the same table for lunch. The two have ended up on opposite sides of the field many times, though - they argue (with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny backing Kyle up) over the Peruvian pan flute band in ""[[Pandemic]]"" and ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"". In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", Craig leads the school in beating Kyle up for not being metrosexual, and in ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"", Craig's show is in direct competition with a show Kyle is involved in. In ""[[Raising the Bar]]"", Craig tells Tolkien he should tell Kyle the truth about exploiting Cartman for TV. Kyle can be seen walking with Craig and Timmy in ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"". In ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"" Kyle says that he thinks that Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler. In ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"", when Kyle says he is going to look for his missing brother, Craig himself volunteers to help Kyle, showing that he considers him enough of a friend to help in difficult times.

Craig and Kenny seem to have formed a sort of friendship. In ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"" Kenny says muffled: ""I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There does not really seem to be a doubt"". Kenny helps Craig with his show in ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"" (although it was induced by Cartman saying that Kenny could not join the school news team due to his poverty), and the two are partners in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"". The two have also been seen sitting next to each other, for example in ""[[The List]]"", and standing near each other on several occasions, this may however just be a coincidence. They are not otherwise shown as being close friends. In ""[[Lice Capades]]"", Craig accuses Kenny of having lice. In ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"", Kenny is heard saying, ""''I fucking hate Craig!''"" at the end (this could have been because of how Craig reacted to the situation in that episode and ""[[Pandemic]]"", or that Craig had just refused to fund another of their music bands).

Cartman appears to view Craig as a rival, trying to prove to him that his gang is cooler than his, like in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", in which he is the one that proposes the idea of showing off his weapons to Craig. A similar thing happens in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", in which he wants to prove that he and his friends are more gayer than Craig's gang.

Cartman has declared his hate for Craig more than once, but despite that, he says ""I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool"" in ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"".

Craig frankly hates Cartman, but he has been seen with him as a right-hand man when Cartman assembles a group of boys for his cause, like in ""[[Lice Capades]]"" or ""[[Marjorine]]"". He is also on Cartman's side of town in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", and works for his business in ""[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]"", along with Clyde, Butters, and later Kyle. In ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", he is holding Cartman's towel when he is fighting [[Dr. David Nelson]] and is seen smiling after Cartman wins the fight.

Craig is often the main rival of Cartman and the other boys but has sometimes seemed to accept Stan, Kyle, and Kenny in episodes such as ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", in which he declares that he also wants to ignore Cartman since he hates him. Furthermore, he is the only boy who does not apologize to Cartman after he saves the hostages in the Red Cross.

Also, in ""[[Tsst]]"", Cartman confronts Craig and asks him if he can stay at his place for a while; Craig refuses and blatantly says, ""''But I hate you''"". This hatred is not always against Cartman. In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", Craig and his gang seem to be rivals with Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman. Craig is aware of Cartman's assertive, selfish, and manipulative nature, as well as the fact that Cartman will always get what he wants in one way or another. This is shown in ""[[Fishsticks]]"", in which he argues with Jimmy that ""You should consider yourself lucky that he (Cartman) is only asking for half."" and tell him to ""Just give him half."" This is also shown in ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", in which he tells Mr. Nelson that trying to teach Cartman a lesson is ""not a good idea"". 

Craig is shown to be close enough to Cartman to sleep over his house for a slumber party.

They are also seen both laughing at the idea of girl's volleyball in ""[[Cock Magic]]"".

Craig joins Kyle, Stan, Butters, Tolkien, Jimmy, and Clyde to smash Cartman's electronics when they think that he is [[Skankhunt42]] in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"".

Jimmy has been Craig's friend on a few occasions and can be seen at times along with [[Craig's Gang]]. He has been seen hanging around Craig in the background for other episodes as well. In ""[[Fishsticks]]"", Craig claims that he likes Jimmy and tries to reason with him to help him out. In ""[[Ginger Kids]]"", Jimmy is seen along with Clyde, Tolkien, and Craig bullying a ginger kid out of the school cafeteria. In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", Jimmy rivals Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny as ninjas along with Craig, Clyde, and Tolkien. Quite often, they are seen sitting near each other in the canteen.

Timmy can be seen sitting beside Craig on numerous occasions, most notably in class in ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"", and at [[Whistlin' Willy's]] in ""[[Margaritaville]]"". In ""Cartman Finds Love"", Timmy can be seen talking and hanging out with Craig for a fair portion of the episode, suggesting a close friendship.

Jason has been in Craig's Gang on one occasion, but has not been seen with Craig since ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"".

[[File:SPLPT5.jpg|thumb|right|Craig, and Thomas.]]
In ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"", Craig meets Thomas at the end and asks if he can hang out with him and ""do his laundry"". However, it is unknown if the two are even friends as Thomas has not been seen since this episode and the two have not been seen together on screen.

Craig and Annie can be seen walking together in a couple of episodes, like the episode ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"". At the beginning of the episode, they are walking together in the background when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is seen crying. The two can also be seen walking in the background of [[South Park Elementary]].

Craig and Red are paired together in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"" where the two appear to enjoy each other's company. They can be seen talking to each other and walking away together in ""[[Funnybot]]"" and are in the children's choir together in ""[[The City Part of Town]]"". Craig and Red can be seen together throughout ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"" and sit next to each other on the bus in ""[[Basic Cable]]"". They can also often be seen sitting next to each other in class.

Craig and Butters seemed to have been friends at one time in the earlier seasons. In ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"" they bully [[Mark Cotswolds]] together throughout the episode. In ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", they are at the gas station together when the couple arrives; Butters is the mechanic and Craig is playing spaceman. In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", they are again seen together urging Cartman to fight [[Wendy Testaburger]]. However, later in the series, their friendship seems to have vanished; in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", Craig is the second kid to hit Butters in the head with the tetherball while the latter is tied to the tetherball pole. 

Craig is shown as being unable to remember whether or not [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] was present at dinner in ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"", noting, ""Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not."", which is ironic because Craig seems to fade in and out of the show as a background character. However, a benevolent situation occurs in ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", in which Butters is looking at the Eavesdropper tabloids with Craig and Stan. Furthermore, in ""[[Going Native]]"", Craig seemed alarmed when he learned of Butters' change in behavior by Cartman and followed the others outside the boys' bathroom and in ""[[Obama Wins!]]"" when Butters' caused an allergic reaction to himself, both of which are unusual for his indifferent personality. This may show he considers Butters as something of a friend.

Craig probably had a girlfriend before and during ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''. However, the player will see that Craig posted on his Facebook, saying that he broke up. He also pointed out that thieves work alone and she was holding him back.

Craig plays a small role in the storyline of ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and appears at the end of the ""Stark's Pond"" level to inform the player of the Sixth Graders' Lair, the stage for the next level, is where they should go next. The boys who told this, which Craig claims he does not know, with [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] angrily noting he sounds like [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], before Craig leaves them, telling them to suck his balls. In gameplay, he is of the same ""Sniper"" class as [[Kenny McCormick]], [[Pip Pirrip]] and [[Professor Chaos]], moving slowly but dealing heavy damage and with a wide range. His special ability slows down all enemies for several seconds.

Craig appears in ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' as a supporting character and later an antagonist.

Craig first appears as a member of [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep|Kupa Keep]], but he was sent to detention. The player has to break him out so he can help retrieve the [[Stick of Truth]]. Afterward, Craig can be seen in various locations at Kupa Keep between missions. Craig joins the other members of Kupa Keep in their infiltration of the Inn of the Giggling Donkey. When the player is trapped in the basement, he comes to the rescue by helping to clear the elves and unlocks the door. He briefly becomes the vendor at the Kupa Keep shop, commenting that Cartman gave him the spot because he sounds like Clyde.

Later on, Craig betrays the other kids and joins Clyde because Cartman ""doesn't have authority anymore"". He becomes Clyde's second-in-command and, while fighting through [[Clyde's Fortress|Clyde's fortress]], fights the player with the help of [[Nazi Zombie Cows]]. Once he is defeated, he does not reappear anymore during the game.

His superhero persona [[Super Craig]] is a member of [[Coon and Friends]]. He and [[Wonder Tweek]] have a side plot together consisting of them having to break up due to Craig refusing to follow Tweek when the latter defected to the [[Freedom Pals]]. The missions focusing on said side plot are [[Ghost Reconciler]], in which Tweek demands custody of their guinea pig Stripe, much to Craig's annoyance, and [[Therapy Wars]], in which they go to a couple counseling session from the advice of [[Richard Tweak]], and eventually end up patching up their relationship and getting back together.

Aside from this side plot, Craig's main prominence is in the mission [[The Chains of Super Craig]], in which the player has to help him find Stripe to get him as a combat buddy, and during the mission [[The Many Asses of Dr. Mephesto]], in which he gets angrier at Dr. Mephesto's unpractical decisions and bad safety protocols.

In his review on the ''South Park'' episode ""[[Fishsticks]]"", Sean O'Neal of the A.V. club refers to the character Craig as a ""[[Wikipedia:Pragmatism (non-technical usage)|pragmatist]]"", for advising [[Jimmy Valmer]] to let [[Eric Cartman]] have half the credit for the [[Fishsticks Joke]].[[File:MrHankeytheChristmasPoo01.jpg|thumb|right|Craig's debut.]]
At the beginning of the series, Craig was an unnamed background character, usually seen in the playground at [[South Park Elementary]] or sitting outside [[Mr. Mackey]]'s office. In Season 3, he was reintroduced as a secondary character, and his first name was revealed. From the third season on, Craig's character was gradually expanded upon. His role in the series gradually increased, given his own episodes in the two-part ""Pandemic"" story. Since the third season, Craig has had at least one speaking role in every season to date.
","['Kenny McCormick', 'Kyle Broflovski', 'Clyde Donovan', 'Tweek Tweak', 'Tolkien Black', 'Thomas Tucker', 'Thomas Tucker', 'Tweek Tweak', 'The Boys', 'Stan Marsh', 'Eric Cartman', 'Kenny McCormick', 'Eric Cartman', 'Butters Stotch', 'Eric Cartman', 'Clyde Donovan']"
Craig's Gang,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Craig%27s_Gang,,"is a group of [[The 4th Grade|fourth graders]] led by [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]. The group consists of [[Craig Tucker]], [[Tolkien Black]], [[Clyde Donovan]], and [[Jimmy Valmer]]. Additional members include [[Tweek Tweak]], [[Jason White]], and [[Butters Stotch]]. They are best known for being rivals to the main boys, although in the majority of episodes they are friendly and part of the same larger social group.

Though the group was not formally established until later in the series, future group members Craig, Tolkien, Clyde and Tweek appear together alongside [[Terrance Mephesto]], [[Bill Allen]], [[Fosse McDonald]], [[Annie Knitts]], [[Bebe Stevens]] as students who bully [[Mark Cotswolds]] and tie him to a flagpole as early as in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"". Those four could also be seen together as the boys' extended group in ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"". Craig, Clyde, and Tolkien throughout these seasons are already depicted together frequently. They, alongside future members Jason and Jimmy, are also prominent in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"". Craig, Clyde, Jimmy and Tolkein can be seen with the boys in the opening of ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"" as well.

The group was formally introduced in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", where Craig, Tolkien, as well as Tweek and Jason, are seen antagonizing ([[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and bullying Kyle, for not adhering as closely to the metrosexual fad. They wear matching outfits and praise themselves for how 'gay' they appear to be in an effort to seem cooler than the boys are.

The boys later brag about their newly purchased weapons ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"" to the group, which is first seen to include Craig, Tolkein and now Clyde, who are joined by Jimmy Valmer when they confront the boys. Though they seem like rivals, they put aside their differences to try to hide Butters' injuries from being exposed to the adults. For the next several seasons, the core group consists of Craig, Tolkien, Clyde and Jimmy.

In ""[[Ginger Kids]]"", they are shown sitting together at lunch, when they kick [[Gary Nelson (Ginger Kid)|Gary Nelson]] out of the cafeteria for being ginger, and again later with [[Bradley Biggle]] at lunch when [[Eric Cartman]] tries to join them and they kick him out as well.

From the ninth season on, both the boys' group and Craig's group are more often seen as friends than enemies, and are increasingly depicted as part of the same larger social group, though Craig, Clyde, Tolkien and Jimmy still generally appeared closer to one another than other characters, with other male classmates sometimes joining them in episodes such as ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", ""[[Marjorine]]"" and ""[[Free Willzyx]]"". From the tenth season onward both groups are almost always seen eating lunch together in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|cafeteria]] as well, sometimes including Tweek, Jason, occasionally [[Kevin Stoley]] or [[Scott Malkinson]] to fill out the group.

The friendship between both groups seems fairly solidified by the twelfth season. In ""[[Super Fun Time]]"", Craig even paired up with [[Kenny McCormick]], and [[Jimmy Valmer]] with [[Kyle Broflovski]]. It is also suggested that Craig is the one who holds a particular dislike of the main group. In ""[[Pandemic]]"" and ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"", Craig explains that he doesn't like them because they always get themselves into trouble that escalates to ridiculous degrees and never learn from the past. From those episodes onward, Craig seems to prefer to avoid conflict with the boys rather than instigate. It is notably that in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", Craig, Clyde, Jimmy, Tolkein and Jason are all seen participating in the ''High School Musical'' fad after explaining it to the boys.

Though the rivalry no longer exists between groups, the characters still seem to hang out together as a unit. Craig, Tolkien and Jimmy let Clyde know about the sock bath in ""[[Lice Capades]]"", while Tolkien, Clyde and Jimmy are seen trying to talk to Craig about his situation with his mother in ""[[The Magic Bush]]"". All six members are seen with the boys and Timmy in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"". Only the four core members of the group help the boys in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"" destroy Cartman's electronics.

Tolkien, Clyde, Craig and Tweek are seen hanging out together in ""[[The Problem with a Poo]]"", marking the first appearance without Jimmy in the group in several years, however, Tolkien, Clyde, Jimmy, and [[Butters Stotch]] are shown preparing for Halloween together at the [[Donovan Residence]] in ""[[The Scoots]]"", with Craig and Tweek part of a separate group.

Though the group has shown to have different members at certain times, there are 4 boys who are shown to be the most prominent:
[[Image:Craig-tucker.png|thumb|150px|Craig Tucker|right]]
Craig wears a blue jacket and a matching blue chullo hat with a yellow puffball on top. In the early seasons of the series, he wore blue jeans, but in more recent seasons he wears high-waisted black pants. Craig's hair is usually shown to be black, although it appeared to be brown in ""The Losing Edge"". In ""Good Times with Weapons"" Craig's eyes are shown to be blue.

[[Image:Token Black2.png|thumb|150px|[[Tolkien Black]]]]
Tolkien wears a light purple Armani Exchange shirt with a letter ""T"" in light orange and a pair of dark gray pants. Being African-American, his skin is dark. He has short black hair.

[[Image:Clyde_d.png|thumb|150px|[[Clyde Donovan]]]]
Clyde has medium-brown hair, wears a burgundy coat, grayish-brown trousers, and sometimes wears ocean-blue mittens. Underneath, he has been shown to wear a green T-shirt with a cow's face on the front. He has been labeled ""the second fattest kid next to Cartman"" despite appearing about the same weight as the others.

[[Image:Jimmy valmer here.png|thumb|150px|[[Jimmy Valmer]]]]
Jimmy wears a yellow long-sleeved shirt, blue jeans and black boots; he wears braces, has a rather lopsided face, brown hair, and sideburns. Like Timmy, he is handicapped, but with a far less severe form of cerebral palsy and can still walk with the aid of crutches. From ""Cripple Fight"" through ""Super Fun Time,"" his eyebrows were the same color as his hair. However, as of ""The China Probrem,"" they're black just like other characters his age.

[[Image:Tweek pic.png|thumb|150px|[[Tweek Tweak]]]]

She becomes terrified of [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] and believes he is going to 'get her', much to the irritation and concern of her conservative parents who think that the school's liberal views were to blame for giving their daughter night terrors.

Unlike her brother and mother, Crystal is quite talkative, taking after her father. She can be quite nervous, particularly when it comes to her fear of President Garrison. She goes along with her parents' Republican and QAnon proceedings, and repeats some of their beliefs, though she does not seem very interested in them. She can also be quite a tattletale when she told her dad that Alejandro is being defiant and disobedient to his adoptive family as shown from ""[[Season Finale]]"".

Crystal is a kindergartener with light, pale brown pigtails and golden star barrettes. She wears a pink t-shirt with a smiling yellow kitten on it and purple shorts. When she goes to bed, she wears a dark blue onesie with pink hoops and trimmings and a white kitten head on the left chest.

Cthulhu,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Cthulhu,,"is a Great Old One (gods of inter-dimensional origins), originally created by author H.P. Lovecraft in his story, ''The Call of Cthulhu'''''. '''He makes his first appearance in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"" and subsequently appears in ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"". He enters the human realm and causes mass destruction. He also teams up with Cartman and is revealed to be the reason for Kenny's immortality.

Cthulhu has enough strength to easily rip a massive Ferris wheel off of its hinges, as though it were made of paper, and hurls down upon unlucky humans. He also kills Justin Bieber by crushing his head between the index finger and the thumb.
*'''Lightning Touch:''' Cthulhu can release lightning from his hands, which can completely incinerate a person in seconds.
*'''Dimensional Travel:''' Cthulhu is shown to be able to make an enemy be sent to R'lyeh, the supernatural capital of his empire, by a wave of his hand.
*'''Flight:''' Due to his massive wings, Cthulhu can fly across long distances, such as the distance between the Moon and the Gulf of Mexico, in seconds.
*'''Storm creation: '''Whenever Cthulhu is present, massive thunderstorms darken the sky.
*'''Immortality:''' In the original story ""Call of Cthulhu"" by H.P. Lovecraft, and ""Trail of Cthulhu"" by August Derleth, Cthulhu would regenerate from any wound, up to and including a nuclear bomb. This is supported in the show when [[Mysterion]] mentions Cthulhu being an immortal, and that only an immortal can kill another immortal. He also demonstrates the ability to survive in the vacuum of space.

He first appears in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"", as one of the characters from the evil side of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]]. He has a more major role ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", when DP (formerly BP) drill a hole in the Gulf and accidentally reaches another dimension, they attempt to rectify the problem by drilling on the moon to change its gravitational pull on the Earth, hoping that this will solve the problem. However, all this does is make the problem a whole lot worse when it releases Cthulhu, a very large green tentacle headed monster with glowing orange eyes, massive wings, and long spindly arms, from his interdimensional slumber. A news reporter explains Cthulhu is expected to reign over the Earth in a dark period of around 3000 years, during which he would drive the world to madness and enslave humanity as members of his cults.

As he continues his rampaging in ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] (dressed as the [[The Coon (Character)|Coon]]) approaches the monster in New Orleans where he attempts to sway Cthulhu to be his ally and help him destroy his friends and former teammates, the [[Coon and Friends]]. Although Cthulhu takes enough time to listen (or at least observe) Cartman's rantings, he grows bored and attempts to leave, at which point Cartman manipulates Cthulhu by behaving overly cute. As a result, Cthulhu grows fond of him and proceeds to do Cartman's bidding. Cartman and Cthulhu proceed to rampage across the world, attacking all the things that Cartman alone deems evil (The Jewish People, San Francisco, Whole Foods, and Hippies).

Their next act of course involves Cartman ordering Cthulhu to send Coon and Friends to dark oblivion. With his friends gone, in ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"" Cartman and Cthulhu continued cutting a path of destruction, massacring [[Justin Bieber]] and his fans, until they are defeated by [[Bradley Biggle|Mint-Berry Crunch]], who had discovered his alien powers, and Cthulhu is sent back to its world, along with his deity armies, and the holes in the Gulf of Mexico are filled.

Cthulhu is a gigantic, inter-dimensional deity, miles high. He is shown towering over a DP (formerly BP) drilling platform. He has two long, massive arms with sharp talons. He has two large bat-like wings on his back. He also has two clawed back legs. He has a long tail, which seems to be used to direct himself through the air. His head has two massive yellow eyes, similar to that of a dinosaur's. Instead of a mouth, he has a large set of tentacles that move whenever he ""talks"", or makes vocal sounds. Though his appearance alone can drive people insane, this is apparently not the case with everyone in the ''South Park'' universe, who react normally to his presence.

[[File:MysterionRises64.png|thumb|Cthulhu using his powers.]]
As shown when he attacks the Gulf of Mexico, Cthulhu is truly a god and is possibly the most powerful being in existence (or the most powerful creature ever shown in South Park), although he is still defeated by Mint-Berry Crunch. His powers include, but are not limited to:

The Cthulhu cult leader wears yellow pants and black belt with a metal D-style belt buckle. He also wears a gray jacket over a blue collarless, button-up shirt and black shoes. He has a bowl-style haircut, shaved hair on the sides of his head with flat hair on top, and he has black eyebrows.

Damien Thorn,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Damien_Thorn,,"is the son of [[Satan]]. He is voiced by [[Matt Stone]], and later by [[Trey Parker]]. He claims to be from the seventh layer of hell. His only two speaking appearances to date were in the eponymous episode ""[[Damien]]"" and in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

Damien burns down all of the playground equipment of [[South Park Elementary]].
*'''Assault:''' While burning down the playground, he sets fire to many people, including [[Red McArthur|Red]], [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]], and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]. He later sends Pip flying into the sky and exploding as a firework.

In ""[[Damien]]"", he joins [[The Boys|the boys]]' class as the new student at [[South Park Elementary]]. He introduces himself as the son of [[Satan]], a claim which is completely ignored by [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], despite his obvious evil powers. Damien is rejected from sitting with the main characters during lunch, and is taunted by [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]. Outraged, he turns Kenny into a duck-billed platypus, then demands to speak to [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]].

Damien's father, Satan, challenges Jesus to a boxing match, and everyone in town switches their bets to Satan, realizing Jesus doesn't even stand a chance. One bet on Jesus remains, secretly placed by Satan himself. Initially, Jesus is horribly beaten, but Satan throws the fight, allowing Jesus to win in order to get everyone's money. Damien then returns to Hell alongside his father, claiming that he only performs evil because he has to. As Damien leaves, Stan and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] briefly lament that he will never be able to gain acceptance because he's always on the move.

Since then, Damien has appeared in the background of various episodes. He was also seen in the movie theater with other children watching ''[[Asses of Fire|Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire]]'' in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

Damien's appearance is fairly plain as he only wears plain black pants and a black long-sleeve shirt. He has eyebrows in the shape of lightning bolts. He has long black wavy hair and does not wear gloves. When he gets upset, his pupils give of a fire effect.

Damien has bizarre supernatural powers which include, but are not limited to, summoning shadow demons, launching fireballs from his fingertips, creating whirlwinds and turning people into animals.

[[Damien]] befriends [[Pip Pirrip]] after being rejected by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the others. Though Damien doesn't like Pip, the two are seen together throughout the episode. Pip shows empathy for Damien, claiming that he ""knows what it's like being the new kid"". Following Pip's advice, Damien goes into counseling with [[Mr. Mackey]], who tells him to be passive and ""overly nice"". Damien tries this with the boys, but is consequently farted on and called 'Fart Boy'. He tells Pip, who is delighted at the thought of losing that nickname to Damien. 

[[File:108_00017.jpg|thumb|Damien and his new friend [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]].]]
Damien and Pip were the only boys not invited to Cartman's birthday party. While sitting on the street, Damien asks Pip if he has always been hated. Pip replies that he has, and that Cartman is also hated, but is accepted by the others for teasing Pip. This gives Damien an idea. Damien takes Pip to Cartman's party and as a gift, sends Pip flying in the air before making him explode. Pip is then seen falling to the ground, where he lands safely in the snow, apparently having enjoyed the experience. This wins Damien's acceptance, and he and Pip are never seen together again.

Damien serves as an unlockable character in the game South Park Rally. He is unlocked by completing the Millennium New Years race without having anyone else collect the Millennium Key except for the player.

Damien plays a minor role in the game, remaining in the theater during the entire game, where he speaks out against [[Rob Schneider]]. He will be added to the player's friend list if spoken to. There were multiple 'Missing' posters for him throughout the town, referencing his lack of attendance in the show. His voice seems to have changed from his speaking appearance to a more standard one, unlike his original high-pitched one.

Damien can be seen on posters for him throughout the town, referencing his lack of attendance in the show.

Damien serves as a boss in the game South Park (GBC), Damien's attacks are throwing snowballs, the player must attack him by using snowballs.

After his initial appearance, Damien was written out of ''South Park'' story-wise, aside from a prominent cameo in ""[[Professor Chaos]]"" as a possible fourth friend, and even is seen holding a rose despite not being called up for one. He still reappears in the background periodically as an animator easter egg, generally once or twice per season, although in recent years he has seen increasing use in scenes taking place in the school gymnasium. Damien gets a speaking role for the first time in 16 years, since his first appearance, in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', where he is seen inside the movie theater watching various trailers.

Denver Broncos,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Denver_Broncos,,"are the NFL team of [[Denver]]. They are the overall favored team of the whole community of ''[[South Park]]'' and are as such, mentioned numerous times. [[John Elway]], a now former star quarterback, is a hero to a majority of the South Park characters.

The entire Bronco team makes their first on-screen appearances in the episode ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"" and ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"", when it is revealed that on the night of the [[Drunken Barn Dance]], [[Eric Cartman]]'s mother [[Liane Cartman]] proceeded to have sex with a large number of men and woman, including the entire Denver Broncos team, which left into question who amongst all the participating men was Cartman's father. In the end however it was revealed that his father was his mother Liane, due to having both male and female genitals.

This episode, and the Broncos, appeared again the episode ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"", in which during a series of flashback, Cartman recalls the discovery of his father, however he intentionally alters the memory to where he claims John Elway to be his father, rather than Liane.

During Kenny's funeral in ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", [[Priest Maxi]] ignores Kenny's death, and instead gives a speech about the Bronco and leads the congregation in a cheer for the team.

In the episode ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", after the kids of South Park get rid of the adults with claims of molestation, they create a tribal community in which they sacrifice one of their own each night to a statue of John Elway.

During ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", [[Jack Tenorman]] who would later be revealed to be right tackle for the Denver Broncos, and father of Cartman's arch-foe [[Scott Tenorman]], appears, in which he catches [[Jimbo Kern]], [[Ned Gerblansky]], Eric Cartman, [[Randy Marsh]], [[Gerald Broflovski]] and several other men watching his wife undress from the bushes outside his house. Later, when Scott convinces his parents that a pony is being abused at [[Bill Denkins]]'s Ranch, they go to save the pony, are killed by the farmer on sight because Cartman fabricated to Denkins that they were deranged pony-killers. They were then ground up into chili by Cartman who later tricks their son Scott into eating them.

In ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"", the boys were told to root for their ""team."" So Stan places up an American flag, says ""go America"" and then ""go Denver Broncos"".

In ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", during Butter's theme song, its shown that [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] is a Broncos fan and has a signed photo of himself with John Elway.

In""[[201]]"", it is revealed that the events of ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" were all a lie created to hide the truth about Cartman's father, due to the fact that the Broncos were having a good season, and everyone feared that the scandal of an illegitimate child amongst the players would be a distraction. It was revealed that the father of Cartman's arch-foe Scott Tenorman, was a right tackle of the Denver Broncos, and that on the night of the Drunken Barn Dance, the ginger-haired Jack Tenorman was the player that got Liane pregnant with Eric, thus making Scott his half-brother.

The Denver Broncos return in ""[[Sarcastaball]]"", where Randy Marsh accidentally invents a sport while trying to be sarcastic during a PTA meeting. The new sport named [[Sarcastaball (Sport)|sarcastaball]], is meant to be gentler than football by replacing the uniforms with brassieres and tinfoil hats and the ball with a balloon. Instead of tackling, the players hug while the quarterback compliments the opposing team. The sport becomes so popular the NFL asks Randy to be the new coach of the Denver Broncos Sarcastaball team.

The Denver Broncos' uniform consists of orange jerseys with the player number in white and outlined in blue, white pants with orange stripes, and blue helmets with orange and white stripes. The uniforms prior to ""[[Sarcastaball]]"" are those worn by the Broncos until 1996. There are no other distinguishing features among the various team members.

Diane Choksondik,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Diane_Choksondik,,"was a fourth-grade elementary teacher who was first introduced in the [[Season Four]] episode ""[[Fourth Grade]]"". Her name is a play on the phrase, ""chokes on dick"". She was the fourth-grade teacher at [[South Park Elementary]] until her death in ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"" (her death was spoiled [[Professor Chaos|in the previous episode]]).

In ""[[Fourth Grade]]"", Ms. Choksondik is first introduced as the school's new fourth grade teacher, the same year the boys are scheduled to attend the fourth grade. The boys and their classmates initially plan to collectively moon her to assert dominance, but she proves intimidating, leading all but [[Eric Cartman]] to back out of the ruse. 

She complains to the school staff that her children are undisciplined, but they are horrified by her appearance. She asks to speak to their previous teacher, but they inform her that [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] is living somewhere out in the mountains as a result of his denial of his homosexuality.

She nonetheless seeks Garrison out and he trains her and advises her on how to deal with the children, while coming to terms with his own sexuality. She returns to the school and uses what she has learned, advising the boys to ""present them"" when they tell her to suck their balls, just as Garrison suggested.

The episode ""[[Professor Chaos]]"" ended on a cliffhanger (though it was revealed in the same episode) saying someone would die, in a parody of cliffhanger endings. It was revealed during this gag that Ms. Choksondik had died. In the following episode, ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", the boys had put some of their [[Sea People]], brine shrimp, in her coffee as a joke.

They went to find their Sea People, to avoid getting caught, and Cartman hid inside her cadaver to avoid being discovered by the mortuary staff. It was revealed in this episode when the boys were watching the news that [[Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey's]] semen was found in her stomach, but that did not contribute to her death.

Her real cause of death is said to be unknown. However, this might be a mystification, since one can easily deduce from [[The Simpsons Already Did It|the episode]]. Full explanation [[The Simpsons Already Did It/Trivia|here]].

After this incident, the students in Ms. Choksondik's class were given two weeks off school until Mr. Mackey taught for a short period. In the episode ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] reprised his role as their teacher until he got fired again in ""[[Where My Country Gone?]]"".

Ms. Choksondik is well known for her distinctive appearance; she has extremely exaggerated saggy breasts, is overweight, and her right eye is lazy, causing it to drift downwards or wobble around as she talks. She also does not wear a bra, so when she lifts her arm up, her shirt stretches going up with it revealing her nipples. She also wears large glasses and was made fun of in high school because of them.

Her outfit consists of a long red V-necked top with white cuffs and a white trim on the hem, and a calf-length blue skirt that is possibly made of denim. She keeps her hair in a loose ponytail held in place with a large white hair-tie and small golden loop earrings. She has a side fringe, which is usually tucked behind her left ear (in fact, the only time it is seen loose is in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"" when she is having sex with Mr. Mackey). Also in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", she is shown to be wearing large purple underpants with a frilly hem (the outline of which shows through her skirt when she bends down). She has plain black shoes and appears to be wearing white socks or tights, but when Mr. Mackey removes her clothes during ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"" it appears that she is not wearing anything on her feet. However, this may be a continuity error.

Ms. Choksondik had a sexual relationship with Mr. Mackey, the school counselor in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", when the two characters realize that they are attracted to each other while discussing sex education. Mr. Mackey refers to a sexual experience at a much younger age as his only one, despite having been married in ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"" while on drugs and having many instances with [[Liane Cartman]]. He could have forgotten about this event though Ms. Choksondik confessed to being a virgin until then (the likely instance of the sexual experience that Mackey was referring to was his rape by [[Woodsy Owl]]).

Doctor Tom is first referred as the owner of [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]], a business seen in several episodes of the show as a prominent location on [[Main Street]], though the interior has only been seen in three instances.

In ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", Doctor Tom advises [[Herbert Garrison]] on the new nose he has always wanted, selecting a procedure that makes him resemble actor [[David Hasselhoff]] and causes him to be incredibly attractive.

In ""[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]"", the interior of his business can be seen, where [[Sharon Marsh]] acts as a receptionist. He makes a cameo in the film during the final sequence.

In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", he is seen cleaning the building in preparation for the arrival of the [[Whole Foods Representative]] and is also seen eating at [[SoDoSoPa]] with other townspeople.

Tom's appearance has been slightly redesigned in his most recent appearance on ""[[Members Only]] "", and he now has a larger head and a slightly thinner build.

Tom appears as a minor character in the game, though unseen, remaining at [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]] during the entire game. He retains the same role in the show, performing plastic surgery on people, with ""The Hasselhoff"" as one of the options available and photographs of the actor throughout the building.

DogPoo Petuski,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/DogPoo_Petuski,,"is a student at [[South Park Elementary]] who is always seen covered in dirt. He was mainly a filler in the classroom throughout the first two seasons, but since Season 3, he only appears occasionally in large groups or in the playground, gymnasium, or hallway. He is voiced by [[Trey Parker]] and makes his first official series appearance in the [[Season One]] episode ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"".

</gallery>

Originally in ""[[The Unaired Pilot]]"", he was seen rolling around in what appears to be a puddle of mud or dog feces during recess with the prototype [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] watching him. Later, in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", he, along with [[Francis]], is one of Mayor [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s assistants.

He had his first speaking role in ""[[Professor Chaos]]"". He was a possible replacement for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and lamented his status as a supporting character, but didn't survive the first cut. Cartman described him as ""more of a prop"". He reappeared in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"" as part of Cartman's entourage against [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. He is the only member besides [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to have lines, yelling ''""GET IT OFF OF ME!""'' when [[Snooki]] rapes him. He makes two appearances in [[Season Fifteen]]. The first is in ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"" when he stays with the boys indoors. He re-appears in ""[[1%]]"" and is seen behind [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] during P.E. His last name was revealed to be Petuski in ""[[T.M.I.]]"".

One of DogPoo's main features is his dirt and mess all over him. He might do this on purpose though, as he rolls around in mud/dog poo in "" [[The Unaired Pilot]]"". He has dirt in his hair, clothes, and on his face. He also has a scab on his cheek. His parents look normal and clean, which means DogPoo probably just likes being dirty.

He has messy, faded brown hair, and wears a messy brown jacket with dark green trousers or track pants. He has a mark on the right side of his jaw that may be a large mole, scab, or dirt stain, similar to Pig-Pen from ''Peanuts'', or actual dog poo. On the left side of his jaw, he has a scratch. His relatively deep voice has a slight Canadian/English twang to it in ""[[Professor Chaos]]"".

Despite being covered in dirt and having a messy appearance, DogPoo is quite sophisticated, speaking in an accent with a slight Canadian/English twang to it. The other kids and adults treat him like everyone else, not even pointing out all his dirt. He also is a bit of a follower, blindly following [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] orders in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"". He is also self-aware of his minor appearance and little interaction with [[the boys]], saying ""I've been around these guys for like, five years, and never got to say or do anything.""

DogPoo can be seen in the Elven Kingdom, where he sends the player on a [[Restoring the Balance|quest]] to destroy some Kupa Keep banners placed in the Elven Territory.

DogPoo can be found near the trash at the [[Basketball Court|basketball court]], and eagerly accepts [[The New Kid]] as a friend.

He made his debut appearance in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"", where he was seen playing with [[Butters Stotch]], [[Pip Pirrip]], and to a lesser extent, [[Stan Marsh]]. Originally in first grade, he advanced to the second grade in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Fourth Grade]]"". He often appears as [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]]' sidekick, General Disarray.

Dougie is shown to be a loud and lonely kid. Like [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], he is often picked on. He hangs out with other outcasts and is claimed to be a nerd by others. He also is very knowledgeable of ''The Simpsons''. He is also not afraid to speak back, as he called [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] a ""sourpuss"".

Dougie, [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] are at [[Mr. Mackey]]'s meteor shower party in ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"". Much to Stan's chagrin, the former three start playing 'Wickershams and Ducklers'. Dougie calls Stan a sourpuss for not joining in.

Moving on to playing ''Charlie's Angels'', the four boys embark on a mission to leave the room through an air vent Dougie finds. After their next mission, they watch a news report about the ATF raiding Mackey's house. Dougie makes a video and Butters delivers it to a reporter, defusing the situation.

In ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", Dougie is sledding at school with Pip, [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]. Shortly after this, in ""[[Fourth Grade]]"", Dougie advanced from the first grade to the second grade.

Butters is fired as [[the boys]]' fourth friend and becomes [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] in the [[Professor Chaos|eponymous episode]]. Dougie joins the group of candidates auditioning to fill the role but is quickly eliminated without having a proper chance. 
[[File:DougiesNoteToProfessorChaos.png|right|thumb|Dougie's note to Butters.]]
He then learns of Butters' secret identity and becomes his sidekick as General Disarray. The two try, unsuccessfully, to ""destroy"" the world by flooding it with a garden hose and by destroying the ozone layer with aerosol spray cans.

He has curly red hair and freckles. He wears an olive-tan sweater with a little dragon embroidered on the chest, blue trousers, and black-rimmed glasses. He also appears to have a slight lisp.

His ""General Disarray"" uniform is similarly constructed to Professor Chaos'. It is made of aluminum foil, and consists of aluminum-covered glasses, aluminum gloves, an aluminum shirt, a badge with the initials ""G.D."" on it, and a brown belt with a golden buckle.

In the episode ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", he resembled Bart Simpson (though still dressed the same) while Butters was hallucinating.
Although its canonicity is disputed, [[General Disarray]] plays a major role in the video game as a villain in the ""South Park Docks"" level where he is summoned to attack the players' characters near the final waves. Like other bosses, the goal is to keep him from reaching the town or the level is lost. Unlike other bosses, he has lines, and his role is slightly explained: he is under the control of the Japanese Video Game Announcer Voice but is unaware of it. He is not a playable character, although [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] is.

Both Dougie and his alter-ego play minor roles as friendable characters in The Stick of Truth. Dougie first appears in Butters' front yard and upon asking him a question he says that Cartman says he's too ginger to join his army, then is later found in the Chaos Lair at [[U-STOR-IT]] as General Disarray.

In this game, Dougie takes on his General Disarray persona and is seen most prominently in [[The Hundred Hands of Chaos]] mission where [[the New Kid]]'s goal is to defeat him. Along with General Disarray, the New Kid is tasked with avoiding the many chaos minions Dougie summons while also watching out for lava above their head. After this battle, the player will unlock [[Toolshed]]'s buddy ability, Sandblaster, which is able to clear lava. While the New Kid goes on to defeat Professor Chaos, [[Captain Diabetes]] keeps General Disarray in check.

Douglas appears as a friendable person in the building next to Unplanned Parenthood. To get to him, you must shoot the window to reveal an alien teleporter which you'll use to get to the room where he is. He seems to think that breaking and entering is cool and praises [[The New Kid]] for doing so.

After the [[The Hundred Hands of Chaos]] mission, as the New Kid changes into their superhero costume, [[Tommy Turner]] shows Douglas how the New Kid had changed so quickly, to which Douglas replied the act as ""dumb"".

Dr. Alphonse Mephesto,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Alphonse_Mephesto,,"is a supporting character in the early Seasons introduced in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"". He is an eccentric geneticist and stereotypical mad scientist who lives and works at [[South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch]].

Dr. Mephesto used to be a prominent supporting character in the first four Seasons, with the people of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] turning to him when they need something beyond the natural. He was shown to be a typical mad scientist living in a secluded part of town who performs several unusual experiments that include putting more than one butt on different animals, always being accompanied by his mutated lab assistant and adopted son, [[Kevin Mephesto]]. The character's prominence lasted until [[Season Four]], before transitioning to a minor character with only guest appearances, along with Kevin.

Mephesto made his first appearance in [[Season One]]'s episode, ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", where he is first seen stealing a blood sample from [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] after informing the [[The Boys|boys]] that the DNA of a pig and an elephant doesn't splice, which he later uses to create a human clone for his [[Terrance Mephesto|first son]] to show at the science fair, which eventually resulted in an aggressive mutant version of Stan, who was eventually let loose by his son and wreaked havoc on the town. Mephesto then enlists the help of [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]] and the [[The Boys|boys]] to help him find the mutant Stan. Mephesto then finally shoots the clone to death after finding it, and apologizes to the boys for the inconvenience, at the end giving a moral lesson stating that one should not play with God's creations and just leave nature alone. After his first appearance, his character began to play a supporting role throughout the episodes.

In ""[[Starvin' Marvin]]"", Mephesto tries to make genetically modified turkeys for Thanksgiving, but the result is several angry mutant turkeys that end up launching an attack on the town. Mephesto tries to alert the [[Mayor McDaniels|Mayor]] about the case, but ends up being ignored. He later tells Chef about the turkeys and claims they are growing at an exponential rate when he shows him their DNA. As Chef warns the town to protect themselves from the mutated turkeys, he asks Mephesto what exactly his lab assistant was supposed to be, with Mephesto only replying that it wasn't important at the moment. In the end, when all the turkeys are killed by the people, Mephesto feels sorry for his creation and once again gives the same moral lesson, stating that he shouldn't play with God's creations, but this time being interrupted by Chef.

In ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", Mephesto offers to help [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] find out who his biological father was, through a DNA test, albeit for a price of $3,000. When he is finally paid, he fulfills his promise to help Cartman with his father's situation. In the sequel, ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"", when he is about to reveal the identity of Cartman's father, he ends up being shot twice after a blackout in the room, thus being taken to the hospital. When Mephesto wakes up after having recovered, he finally reveals that Cartman's father was his own mother, as she is a hermaphrodite. He also reveals that the person who shot him was actually his brother, who tries to kill him every month.

In ""[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]"", Mephesto takes the [[Larry (""Prehistoric Ice Man"")|frozen man]] discovered by the boys to his lab to thaw him. When thawed, he places him in a habitat from 1996, which was the last time he was free. Some federal agents arrive at the ranch to see him, intending to use him as a weapon, but cover up this plan from Mephesto, which allows people to pay to see the man. When the man is released and freed by Stan, Mephesto and the federal agents immediately set out in search of him, with the help of Steve Irwin, but end up failing in the end after he escapes with a helicopter.

In ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", Mephesto tries to win the Nobel Prize with a ""seven-assed Galapagos Turtle"", but loses to [[Randy Marsh]]. Later, he reveals that Randy's theory about Spontaneous Combustion is causing a change in the environment.

In ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"", he is called upon by the people to help the creatures recently found by the boys, the [[Jakovasaur|Jakovosaurs]], to reproduce.

Mephesto plays his final role as a supporting character in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"". When Cartman is on a quest to find more ""mature"" friends, he asks Mephesto for help so he can genetically create a friend for him. Mephesto ends up denying Cartman's request due to the fact that genetic engineering doesn't reach the point of creating people, however, he solves Cartman's problem by inviting him to NAMBLA, which is under his leadership. Cartman then addresses the [[North American Man-Boy Love Association]], which raises an impression that Mephesto was a Child Predator to some extent, when it is revealed that he was actually the leader of another group with the same acronym, called the [[North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes]] Association, and that Cartman had gotten mixed up and joined the wrong group. After FBI agents break into Mephesto's meeting with the organization unaware of the existence of another NAMBLA, they inform the members of the other NAMBLA's presence in South Park, surprising Mephesto and the other members, who claimed to hate this organization for its purpose and for stealing their acronym, thus helping the FBI locate and arrest members of the North American Man-Boy Love Association.

In later Seasons, starting in [[Season Five]], Mephesto began to only make cameos, usually being seen in crowd scenes that feature earlier characters.

Mephesto's many cameos throughout the episodes include:
Dr. Mephesto has genetically engineered many different species, such as a four (later five) - assed [[Four-Assed Monkey|monkey]], a four-assed ostrich, a four-assed mongoose, a mouse/duck, a gorilla/mosquito, a rabbit/fish (this is fake because [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] said the ears are tied on them), a four-assed frog, a seven-assed Galapagos Turtle, loads of pissed off turkeys and a mutant [[Clone Stan Marsh|clone of Stan]].

He genetically mutates some of the sixth graders and [[Kyle Schwartz]] in [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]], with [[Mitch Conner]]'s sponsorship.

The character is an extended reference to Marlon Brando's portrayal of Dr. Moreau in the 1996 film version of The Island of Dr. Moreau. He is even a member of the North American Marlon Brando Lookalike Association (the other NAMBLA). Like Dr. Moreau, Dr. Mephesto creates strange creatures with his talents; however, his creations are things like animals with multiple sets of buttocks. Mephesto believes it is for the good of the Earth, and that animals with one set of buttocks are inferior and must be destroyed. He even goes as far as presenting a ""seven-assed Galapagos Turtle"" in an attempt to win a Nobel Prize, but loses to Randy Marsh's ""Unified Theory of Fart Thing"". He also performs experiments ranging from simple DNA tests to creating a genetic clone of [[Stan Marsh]] for his son's project and later a clone of the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]].

Mephesto is a middle-aged man with gray hair and a wrinkled face. He wears an old brown hat over a white bandana that covers his hair, in addition to brown pants and a yellow flowered Hawaiian button-down shirt with an open collar, revealing chest hair. He is usually seen walking around with a cane, whose handle is shaped like a pair of buttocks. In ""201"" with the character's return, Mephesto's appearance underwent a major redesign to suit the show's current animation style, with his clothing and cane now being smoothed and detailed, as well as less coarse facial wrinkles and a completely new and less rectangular side view.
Dr. Mephesto has two children, [[Terrance Mephesto|Terrance]], who attends [[South Park Elementary]], and [[Kevin Mephesto|Kevin]], who helps him in his lab.

Although Mephesto is shown to be Terrance's father, they are never seen together save for one episode.

In ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", Terrance is shown to greatly admire his father for his inventions and praises him after creating a human clone for his science fair, though they fall out when his son disobeys him, releasing the clone after he suggested getting rid of it after realizing it was too dangerous. Mephesto however, still offers his son [[Four-Assed Monkey|one of his creations]] to present at the science fair.

[[File:Kevin.jpg|left|thumb|Kevin]]
Kevin is Mephesto's adopted ""son"" who works as his lab assistant, being almost always seen by his side and accompanying him. Kevin was shown to be quite loyal and helpful to Mephesto, even though he was quiet and silent.

Kevin's story is told in the song ""[[Mephesto and Kevin]]"" by Primus from Chef Aid: The South Park Album; he was apparently a failed attempt to create a perfect pop singer, a test tube baby created from [[Michael Jackson]]'s sperm and the egg of an unspecified, musically talented female donor, brought to term inside the womb of a llama. It is also revealed Kevin is legally Dr. Mephesto's son.

Dr. David Nelson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._David_Nelson,,"is a man with dwarfism who comes to the [[South Park Elementary]] to give a talk about his experience in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"". He was voiced by [[Trey Parker]] by taking in helium to create the distinct high pitched voice.

Nelson's only appearance is the episode ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", in which he first appears to give a talk at South Park Elementary to all students. Upon entering, he is almost immediately laughed at and mocked by Cartman, which Nelson dismisses believing he will stop eventually. Later, he complains to [[Principal Victoria]] and [[Mr. Mackey]] and claims that if he could have a one-on-one talk with Cartman, he could change his views, but as Cartman is sent in, he begins to laugh again, causing Dr. Nelson to have an outburst, yelling ""Shut your fucking mouth!"", to the shock of Principal Victoria. He is clearly embarrassed by this, claiming it was a joke, and that Cartman failed to break him.

Next, he gets all the fourth-graders to say ""Hello, fatso!"" when Cartman enters the room, which they do. Upon annoyingly questioning who organized this, Nelson reveals himself, only to cause Cartman to laugh at him even more. Finally, they have a fight, in which Cartman gains the upper hand of making Nelson repeat a line said by Zelda Rubinstein in the film ''Poltergeist''. Cartman goes off guard for a few seconds, only for Nelson to clobber him to the ground, and he then leaves, believing he has proven his point, with Cartman lying on the ground, once again laughing hysterically at Nelson.

Dr. Nelson seems to be a very intellectual man, having published six books in total, but after being pushed too far, in terms of mocking his dwarfism, he acts childish and aggressively with constant attempts to take revenge, using juvenile - and later - violent methods. He does seem to have little concern over his condition if he is not teased about it too much, and constantly claims that he feels ""Words are like bullets, and I let them pass straight through me.""

Mentioned by [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] to Eric, Nelson has a black belt in karate, which seems to show he is strong as well, but during his fight with [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], this does not seem the case, as Cartman wins the fight, up until Nelson manages to finally floor Cartman with a single kick, before walking away, as Cartman continues to laugh at him for his dwarfism.

Dr. Doctor,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Doctor,,"('''Dr. Horatio Gauche''' in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' and '''Dr. Kels''' in ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"") is a doctor in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] known for his unusual diagnoses. He worked in [[Hells Pass Hospital]], although as of ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"", he seems to own his own practice.

He first appeared in ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" as one of the only surgeons at Hell's Pass Hospital with [[Nurse Goodly]], working to save several patients including [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]] during a blizzard. He makes [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy]], [[Eric Cartman]], [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Kenny McCormick]] honorary doctors. At the end of the episode they successfully manage to recuperate Mephesto so he can reveal the identity of Cartman's father.

He was one of the doctors who operated on Kenny McCormick after being lit on fire and having a load of salt dumped on him. He replaces Kenny's heart with a baked potato, and was unsuccessful with reviving Kenny. At first he was incredibly upset, but straight after his cry, he and the other doctors just walked off whistling. He also called the parents of the children telling them they went to see the [[Terrance and Phillip]] movie, causing them to be grounded and start [[Mothers Against Canada]].

In ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"", after [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is admitted to the hospital following his possession by the soul of his deceased friend, Kenny McCormick, the Doctor's diagnosis is ""his time is running out"", and uses that phrase as if it were a literal medical diagnosis, explaining if he doesn't get a ""time transplant"", he will die. In the episode ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"", which is a spoof of the film 'You Got Served', the Doctor treats [[Randy Marsh]] after Randy is ""served"" (slang term for being beaten in a dance competition) by a group of street dancers, as if ""being served"" constitutes an actual physical transgression that incurs major injuries.

In ""[[Pre-School]]"", he treats the kids of South Park after bullying, even though they were merely the victim of mild abuse such a ""second-degree titty twister."" In ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"", after Cartman is hospitalized following an attempt to fly by jumping off a roof with cardboard wings, the Doctor tells his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] that he is ""incredibly stupid"" and that the stupidity caused the fall.

In ""[[Stanley's Cup]]"", he is the doctor for [[Nelson Brown]], a young boy with cancer who plays for the [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]] that Stan is coaching. After the team draws with the [[Adams County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]], Dr. Doctor explains to Stan that Nelson is in a ""cancer limbo"" because neither team won. He explains that Nelson's hope that Stan will lead the team to victory is the only thing keeping him alive, and that if the team were to lose, he is sure to die.

In ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"", Dr. Doctor returns, now working at his own practice, when [[Randy Marsh]] sees him for medical marijuana. He assures Randy that he's healthy, so Randy goes out of his way to get Testicular Cancer so he can smoke medical marijuana. Doctor is intelligent enough to notice the correlation between the rise in cancer and the marijuana store, but incorrectly asserts that [[KFC]] is keeping people healthy, resulting in Marijuana being banned, and KFC being re-legalized as Medicinal Fried Chicken.

In episodes such as ""[[About Last Night...]]"", ""[[Poor and Stupid]]"" and ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", different Doctors are shown, but Dr. Doctor reappears from time-to-time. His absence could possibly be explained by him working out of his own practice instead of Hell's Pass Hospital now.

Dr. Doctor has wavy dark gray hair combed and is bigger than most other adults. He wears a white shirt under a turquoise lab coat with a badge on the right side and a stethoscope.

At home, MLKKK gets a phone call from an unknown caller, the father, who says ""I know where you live now you son-a bitch"". MLKKK flees his home in terror. After crashing into the car in front of him, he is confronted by the father. The father says that he has waited a long time for this day. He then pours a bucket of gasoline onto MLKKK and sets him on fire. The daughter asks, ""Is he burning, Pa?!"" The father replies, ""He's burning bright, little girl.""

Both of them have brown hair. The daughter has two pigtails tied with bows and is wheelchair-bound. She is overweight and wears a light pink pony t-shirt, purple shorts, light pink socks and black shoes. Her sleeves and socks have purple lace. The father has longish hair and a five o' clock shadow. He wears a dirty dull green t-shirt, blue jeans and gray track shoes.

Father Maxi,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Father_Maxi,,"is a Roman Catholic priest who serves as the mouthpiece for [[South Park (Location)|South Park's]] Christian community. He is voiced by [[Matt Stone]] and runs the [[South Park Church]]. He first appears in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"".

</gallery>

Father Maxi's unwavering belief that everyone is going to [[Hell]] goes so far as that he bluntly claims that [[Timmy Burch]] would go to Hell since Timmy cannot confess his sins, as he cannot speak anything fluently.

However, at times Father Maxi can come off as less of a fundamentalist, as in ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"" in which he grows concerned by the massive amounts of sexual abuse cases regarding priests and children and is horrified to discover that sex with children is apparently part of [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Law. When he discovers this, he makes several attempts to change the ""Holy Doctrine"" so that sex with children is wrong and suggests that priests be allowed to have sex with women.

His desire to change Vatican Law and be allowed to sleep with women may have something to do with the fact that he has apparently had sex with several women in South Park, including [[Liane Cartman]].

There are also times where he seems to know very little about religion; once, when seeing [[Jesus Christ]], he exclaimed ""Hey, it's that guy from the public access show!"" However, considering that Jesus actually hosts a cable access show in South Park, this is most likely done for irony purposes.

When it's announced that Jesus has been removed from the Christmas play, he requests that [[Santa Claus]] and [[Frosty]] be removed as well.

He has his first major role in this episode. He expresses his beliefs on whether or not the handicapped will go to Hell to the [[The Boys|boys]]. They later see him having sex with a woman in the church confessional, which gives Cartman the idea to lead his own Christian community.

Father Maxi claims he will be able to convert [[Big Gay Al]] to in being straight but it is revealed he made a similar claim about a man called ""Peterson"" who Father Maxi himself ended up having sex with.

Despite his character flaws, it was Father Maxi who, in the episode ""Red Hot Catholic Love"", unearthed the massive corruption behind the many church-related sexual assaults. He also forced the Catholic Church to stop letting priests molest young boys. Apparently, this plan almost succeeds.

Serves a semi-major role as an affiliate of [[Randy Marsh]], along with [[Skeeter]], [[Stephen Stotch]], and others, during his rebellion against the economy as an illusion to the mythologies of [[Moses]], and [[Jesus Christ]]. Ironically, he wasn't on the side of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]].

Father Maxi temporarily closes the church and becomes friends with [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] after the churchgoers heckle him with pedophilia jokes. After Butters takes Maxi to [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde's]] birthday party and the children refuse to accept Maxi's presence, Maxi cuts ties with Butters, explaining he feels guilt for knowing the Catholic Church were doing terrible things to boys and doing nothing about it. However, when the [[Catholic Cleanup Crew]] kidnaps Butters, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and Clyde, Maxi goes to save them. The crew offers to transfer him, but Maxi runs them over with a ""Kumboni"" as he realizes his purpose is defending the boys. He then returns to the church and preaches about penance despite the continuing pedophilia jokes.

Priest Maxi can sometimes be seen wearing black pants, black shoes, and a black shirt with a white roman collar. Other times he wears a black cassock and a purple stole, traditionally worn in the Catholic church during Lent and Advent. He has brown and gray hair with a hairstyle and a double chin, he also has a wart on his forehead and his eyes are slightly spread apart, and he is seen wearing black glasses. Father Maxi's appearance was lightly redone in the episode ""[[A Boy And A Priest]]"".

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he wears a red and black cardinal robe.

His personality seems somewhat flexible based on the needs of the show; often he is a narrow-minded and intolerant man who is convinced most people are going to be damned to [[Hell]], often for trivial offenses. For example, in ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"" he states constantly through his sermons that Hell awaits everyone in the town who does not go to church and confess their sins.

Father Maxi is rude and disrespectful towards the beliefs of others, such as he when he tricks [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who is Jewish, into helping [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], into doing the Stations of the Cross. Also in ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"", he informs Kyle that because of his beliefs, he and his family will go to Hell without question.

However, he still attempts to be a good priest and leader of the community. In ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"", it's revealed that he's the ''only'' priest not engaging in pedophilia. As a result, he points out that they are to spread the word of God, not harm the innocent. He even goes to [[Vatican City]] to stop this and nearly brings down the church as a result.

Though as a Roman Catholic priest Maxi is supposed to be celibate, he does not seem to regularly practice this. Like most of the adults in South Park, he has had sex with [[Liane Cartman]] at some point in his life, as mentioned in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"". In ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"", he was caught having sex with a woman named Mrs. Donovan, however, it is unlikely that she is [[Betsy Donovan]], as her appearance was significantly different.

In ""[[Cripple Fight]]"" he admitted to having once been homosexual but claims to be reformed; however he apparently once had a sexual relationship with a man with Peterson who he was supposed to be trying to reform of homosexuality. In ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"" he pushes for a reformation of the celibacy rules as a way to stop priest pedophilia. He befriends Butters in ""[[A Boy And A Priest]]"" as Butters comforts him after he is the butt of pedophilia jokes; during this episode, he decides to fight even harder to protect the children from the church's habits of molestation.

Much like [[Principal Victoria]], his inverted name is a reference to singer Maxi Priest.[[The New Kid]] can approach Father Maxi outside City Hall to start the side quest [[Find Jesus]].

[[The New Kid]] can talk with Father Maxi in the [[South Park Church|Church]] to start [[A Touch of Faith]] mission. After completing [[The Thin White Line]], he will call the New Kid and give him the side mission [[Touch the Sky]].

Filmore, with the help of his best friend [[Quaid]] and other kindergartners, competes with Ike to see who will be the new class president. The dispute between the two ends up exaggerating and turning into something serious, with the presence of lawyers, legal forms and even Filmore's celebrity aunt, [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. In the end, Filmore ends up bored and gives up competing, leaving Ike as the class president.

After his debut, Filmore, along with the other Kindergartners and the classroom, began to be seen frequently in later episodes, playing relatively minor roles.

He played his first minor role in ""[[It Hits the Fan]]"", after the word ""shit"" began to be used frequently in town and was allowed at school, where he asked his teacher, [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], if saying ""I have to take a shit"" is allowed.

In ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", Filmore is seen again in his classroom, asking Mr. Garrison if he can fingerpaint while in a sexual education class.

Fingerbang,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Fingerbang,,"was a boy band founded by [[Eric Cartman]] in the episode ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"". The other band members were [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Kenny McCormick]]. Additional members that joined later included [[Wendy Testaburger]] and later [[Randy Marsh]], who replaced Kenny after he was killed by an elevator at the mall.

Cartman started the band as a way to make $10 million after dreaming about it. He also believed that the dream was a sign from [[God]]. Acting on Cartman's apparent divine guidance, [[The Boys|the boys]] formed Fingerbang. Realizing that they required a fifth member to be a real boy band, they held auditions at Cartman's house. [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] auditioned for the fifth place, but both were rejected. Eventually, Wendy was accepted by popular vote regardless of her being a girl, after singing a [[Wendy's Audition Song|wonderfully vulgar song]], despite Cartman's protests.

The group then made a music video, complete with stupid outfits and screaming fangirls, but Cartman was dissatisfied due to [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]'s filming. Unbeknownst to the band, the video had actually been taped over [[Liane Cartman|Cartman's mom]]'s porn. When they showed the video to the manager of the mall, he liked the porn and agreed to let them use the mall as their concert venue.

Unfortunately, before the band's first concert, Kenny was killed by an elevator. Randy Marsh had to take Kenny's place. After Fingerbang's first concert, they decided that the fame was too much to handle and they went on indefinite hiatus. ""[[Fingerbang (Song)|Fingerbang]]"" is the only song they are known to have sung.

Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny re-unified as Fingerbang in ""[[Band in China]]"", with [[Butters Stotch]] on guitar and [[Jimmy Valmer]] on drums, continuing their roles from the band [[Crimson Dawn]]. The four boys wore the same white outfits that Cartman had dreamed about them wearing and filmed a sequence for a potential biographical film, but Stan ultimately called the whole thing off due to meddling by [[China]]. The band's other former members were not present.

Firkle Smith,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Firkle_Smith,,"is a kindergartener who first appeared in the [[Season Seven]] episode, ""[[Raisins]]"". He is the youngest member of the [[Goth Kids]].

In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", he set fire to the South Park Hot Topic store, burning it to bits and pieces.
*'''Attempted murder:''' Firkle attempts to kill Mysterion in ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", but the Cult Leader does so instead.
*'''Attempted murder/kidnapping:''' In ""The Ungroundable"", he, along with the Goths, kidnaps [[Mike Makowski]], the leader of the [[South Park Vampire Society]], with the intent of murdering him. However, they change their minds after he admits he is not a vampire and ship him off to Scottsdale, Arizona instead.
*'''Drug abuse/underage smoking: '''The Goth Kids are frequently seen smoking cigarettes despite their ages (5-11), in addition to abusing cough syrup to hallucinate.
*'''Treason/sedition:''' In the Superhero Arc, the Goths are shown to be part of the Cthulhu cult and supporting the [[Cthulhu|eponymous monster's]] reign of terror. They later leave the cult, though, expressing dissatisfaction with the outcome.
*'''Violation of firearm laws/threatening with a deadly weapon''': In [[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]], Firkle threatens Michael, Mike, and Pete with a gun. Because he is no older than six, it is illegal for him to have this weapon.

Firkle says that most people are ""Nazi conformist cheerleaders"", and that he is the biggest non-conformist there is. In ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"", Firkle turns on the other goth kids and reveals that he was in on the plot to turn people ""emo"" with plants. Later, it is discovered that the plants were fake. He was shocked that he betrayed his friends for nothing. He was likely readmitted back into the group; he is still seen with the other Goth Kids in subsequent appearances.

He plays the drums in the Goth Kids' band during the talent show in ""[[Erection Day]]"".
Whenever things do not go his way, he pulls up a weapon at his enemies to fear him. In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", he opens up a blade in front of the [[Mysterion]]. And in ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"", he pulls up a cocked gun and points it at the Goth Kids and the [[South Park Vampire Society|Vamp Kids]]. It is never shown with Firkle killing anyone on-screen, but he uses his blade for battles in ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''.

[[File:Kid_goth.png|thumb]]
He is referred to as a midget in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"" by an unknown student when wearing regular clothes. He has short, soft black hair with a long side-swept fringe parted to the right, wears dark purple lipstick and black eyeliner. He wears a black trench coat, black pants, and black shoes.

As a conformist in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", he wore a turquoise dress-shirt, khaki pants, and gray shoes with a white stripe each.

During the [[Attack the School]] quest in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', he dresses up as a Viking. He wears a brown Viking helmet (more different than [[Michael|Michael's]] and appears heavy), and a green-silked cape.

When he reveals himself as an actual Emo in ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"", the hair he had on was just a toupee. He had his actual hair dyed magenta at the ends with a smaller fringe, a dark-gray t-shirt with a gray skull and polka-dots, and some colorful bracelets.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Firkle appears as an adult man, and is radically different from his past form. Firkle seemingly was stopped adding make up to make his skin pale, because it its now the most natural shade of the Goth Kids. In addition he still has a similar hair but with an under buzzcut. He also has tear-like eye shadow, a brow piercing, sunken cheeks, and seemingly has tattoos on his arms.

Like the other goth kids, Firkle is depressed, cynical, nihilistic, wallows in his own self-pity, and is akin to the goth stereotype. In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", Firkle pulls out a switchblade and threatens to murder [[Mysterion]], proving he is fully capable of taking a person's life for the [[Cult of Cthulhu]]. In ""Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers"", Firkle betrays the other goth kids. His willingness to sacrifice his friends, with no hesitation, and simply for his own benefit, makes him the least ""conformist"" of all of the Goth Kids.

Firkle appears with the rest of the Goth kids at [[South Park Elementary]]. Firkle and the other goth kids can be recruited and friended on Facebook through the quest [[PTA Problems]].

Firkle and the other Goth Kids can be found in [[Henrietta's Bedroom]]. [[The New Kid]] is required to complete a ritual in the room before they can take a selfie.

Flo Kimble,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Flo_Kimble,,"and was [[Sharon Marsh]]'s and [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]]'s aunt.

She is said to visit the Marsh residence once a month, and would visit for nearly a week at a time. On her last visit, she gave her grandniece [[Shelley Marsh|Shelley]] a television/CD player/surround-sound home theater. She also gave her grand nephew [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] an evil goldfish that killed numerous people, including Aunt Flo herself and Kenny.

Before her death, Aunt Flo caught Sharon walking into the house, covered in blood and carrying a shovel after burying the first murdered victim of the fish. Flo comments that it reminds her of a time when she saw Sharon doing the exact same thing when Sharon was twelve years old, implying that Sharon may have been involved with another murder at the time. Sharon later buried her in the back yard with the other bodies.

Great-Aunt Flo is an aged and very skinny woman, with vivid red-hair. She has horn-rimmed glasses, a pink sweater, a pale green skirt, grey leggings and black shoes. She is constantly shaking due to the fact that she suffers from Parkinson's disease.

Although she is, for the most part, kind and helpful, she appears to be sensitive and slightly unstable. For example, when she finds out that Stan doesn't like the goldfish she bought for him, she feels that she is a bad aunt and begins to sob. These could be behavioral effects of Parkinson's disease.

Flo is Sharon's aunt. Although Sharon always maintains a pretense of politesse, her visits place great stress on Sharon, turning her into ""a total bitch"". Sharon always acts supportive of her aunt, often to the detriment of her other family members, onto whom she often vents her frustrations. She does seem to genuinely care about Aunt Flo, as she is distraught after her death. Regardless, she buries her body.

Randy greatly dislikes Aunt Flo's visits, as Sharon acts like a bitch during her stays, often forcing him to sleep on the couch. He acts callous and indifferent after her death.

Due to a lack of meaningful interactions, Flo's relationship with her grand-niece Shelly is difficult to gauge. Shelly received a television/CD player/surround-sound home theater as a gift from Aunt Flo; Shelly thanked her for the gift.

Stan harbors a dislike for Aunt Flo, since her visits turn his mom into a ""total bitch"". He also received a homicidal gold fish from an alternate dimension from Aunt Flo, which went on to really ruin his day.

Flora Larsen,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Flora_Larsen,,"is a [[Kindergartners|kindergartner]] girl. She made her first appearance in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"".

Flora has short blonde hair with 2 bows in it and she has black eyes. She has fair skin. She also wears a light pink shirt, along with pink pants and black shoes. In some episodes, her shirt has a purple heart on it. 

In ""[[Funnybot]]"", she was seen in a dress that was the same color of her pants that she usually wears at the ""[[1st Annual Comedy Awards]]"". Later in the episode, she was seen in her normal clothes. 

Her name is likely a play on ""Florida"", as the state was undecided in the presidential election a few days before ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"" aired.

In ""[[Royal Pudding]]"", Flora was shown to be talented with the piano as she was shown playing it in [[Mr. Mackey]]'s play on ""Tooth Decay"".

In ""[[Reverse Cowgirl]]"", she had a cameo appearance, where she was shown on one of the [[Toilet Safety Administration|TSA's]] bathroom monitors sitting on a toilet.

She appears as one of the six kindergarteners who hides in [[Hide 'n' Seek]]. After the player finds her, she befriends them. Her appearance changes a little as she is seen with a red heart on her shirt.

In the episode ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"", it reveals that her sister is 4th grader [[Millie Larsen]] and they are seen with their mother [[Mrs. Larsen]]. They were at the zoo and Flora was seen in a stroller.

Flora has a possible friendship with [[Jenny (Kindergartner)|Jenny]] and Filmore as she is seen hanging out with them in ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"", ""[[Toilet Paper]]"", ""[[Butt Out]]"", “[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", and ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"".

Flora is a sweet and well-meaning but horribly indecisive little girl in the Kindergarten class. She has trouble making any kind of decision, whether it's a class presidential race or where to hide while playing hide and seek.

The Fonics Monkey is the key component of a boxed set called ""Hooked on Monkey Fonics"". The set is designed to help children learn to spell (particularly focusing on phonics) and includes the monkey along with a miniature drum set and a tape. The idea behind the set is for the monkey to keep the beat whilst the tape narrates instructions; the tape mentions how a replacement monkey can be ordered if the one included in the box is dead.

[[Liane Cartman]] bought the set to help [[Eric Cartman]] win a spelling bee. After a successful first attempt at learning with Fonics Monkey, Cartman becomes over-confident in his abilities as a speller and takes the monkey with him to the spelling bee. However, when he is ask to spell the word 'chair' (the same word Phonics Monkey helped Cartman successfully learn earlier in the episode), Cartman looks expectantly at the monkey who chooses to masturbate instead of helping Cartman. Cartman loses, and Fonics Monkey ends up loafing around the house with Cartman when he begins 'home schooling'. Phonics Monkey later kills [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] in the episode. This is an instance where when [[Kenny's Deaths|Kenny dies]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] does not say ""You bastard!"" Instead, after [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] says ""Phonics Monkey killed Kenny!""

Foreman,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Foreman,,"is a minor character introduced in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"".

[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is annoyed by the rainforest walk and eventually drifts away from [[Getting Gay With Kids|the group]]. He ends up finding a clearing full of excavators and several loggers, he goes to the foreman for help and says he is hungry, the foreman gets worried about him and tells the other loggers to bring him food. The foreman then goes with the other loggers to rescue the children and [[Ms. Stevens]] from the [[Yanagopa Tribe]]. The foreman is seen running over a snake and kills one of the Yanagopa. He is later seen talking to Ms. Stevens and the children, he reveals that Cartman helped him find them and says he was clearing much of the rainforest to make a lumber yard. This delights Ms. Stevens, who now hates the rainforest after the ordeal of getting lost there, to the surprise of the foreman.

After his first appearance, his character began to be used prominently in construction scenes in later episodes.

He was seen in ""[[Goobacks]]"" as one of the rednecks who were complaining about people of the future having ""taken their jobs"". He can be seen among the angry rednecks saying [[""They took our jobs!""]].

In ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", his character is used in the news as one of the construction workers who got hit by cars.

Fosse McDonald,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Fosse_McDonald,,"is a male student at [[South Park Elementary]] who was often seen in the early seasons with [[Bill Allen]]. Similar to ''Beavis and Butthead'', Fosse often calls things ""gay"" followed by laughing in a deep voice.

Fosse wears a purple shirt similar to [[Terrance Mephesto]]'s, except with many more stripes along with black suspenders. He also wears black pants and matching gloves. His hair is black but stringy, meaning it could be a different color if it was full. He had thick eyebrows during the first four seasons, but was later redesigned to have regular ones. He also seems to have bigger eyes than other children.
Fosse is a bully, often laughing at things and people (in a similar matter as ''Beavis and Butthead''). In addition, he thinks everything is gay; on one occasion Fosse even said ""we're gay"", which shows he thinks everything is gay. Due to his seeming stupidity, it appears he did not advance to the fourth grade. He is never seen in the fourth grade classroom, but is in the halls, and is only seen in the hallway and playground after the second season. His voice appears to sound almost the same as [[Bill Allen]]'s. He was seen in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"" when the boys discovered he, along with Bill, had stolen [[Sarah Peterson]]'s doll. They then played along and were ""shot"" in the game; however, they were just playing a game and did not die. Fosse seems to be one of the more naive children in the school along with Bill, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Jason White|Jason]], and [[DogPoo Petuski|DogPoo]]. In the episode ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", he is seen as part of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s group to help capture and lock up [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. It seems that unlike most other kids, ([[Craig Tucker|Craig]], [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], [[Jimmy Valmer]]) who are more aware of Cartman's manipulating methods, Fosse still has not wised up to it and so that is why Cartman would most likely seek him out for help.

[[File:Damien058.png|thumb|Bill and Fosse's fathers.]]
Due to Fosse's quick phasing out from the series, his family was never officially seen. In the episode ""[[Damien]]"", [[Mr. Allen|two older]] [[Mr. McDonald|men]] are seen in the bar after [[Jesus]] storms out, saying ""This show's gay"" followed by ""Yeah, gay"" in the similar style to Bill and Fosse, while also having the same face and clothes but adult bodies. In the commentary of the episode it was revealed that these two characters were indeed Bill and Fosse's parents.

Fosse is a minor character in the game. He participates in the attack on [[South Park Elementary]] and Clyde's fortress alongside the player. He is seen being attacked by three elves, and he befriends the player after he saves them.

Fosse can be found with Bill at the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] bar. When interacted with, Fosse says, ""Sorry, you're not my type"" with regards to the player, Bill then responds with, ""Yeah, he's taken"", referring to Fosse. This could been seen as confirmation that Bill and Fosse are (somewhat ironically) in a relationship with one another; or it may simply be seen as the duo engaging in another example of their ""that's gay"" routine.

The New Kid can get a selfie with him if they have at least one active [[Class:Speedster|speedster]] ability.

Mr. Fun had reservations about selling his park because attendance had gone down causing the business to lose money. When Cartman tells him he wanted the park to himself, by not allowing anyone else in, Mr. Fun relents.

After they explain that innocent lives are at stake, he agrees to help, killing [[Woodsy Owl]] and rescuing [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Mr. Mackey]].

Freddy's first appearance was a relatively faithful reproduction of his portrayal in the film series, with a grotesquely scarred face, crumpled brown fedora, striped red shirt. and trademark bladed glove.

Freddy was significantly redesigned for his second appearance in ""[[Insheeption]]"", having grown a full beard and drawn with a completely different facial structure. At first, having discarded his fedora, he later dons it again when he goes back to work alongside shaving his beard.

The two versions of Freddy are arguably entirely different characters.

The Imaginationland Freddy is shown to be naturally violent, brutalizing [[Strawberry Shortcake]], and declaring himself the evilest villain. However, it is implied that his real-world counterpart was tricked into violence by government agents, in some hackneyed Cold War-related scheme.

*'''Funnybot to [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]:''' ""Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together. I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.""

His goal was to act as if he was from a future in which [[Stan Marsh]] was addicted to drugs in order to dissuade Stan from getting involved in drugs. The plan completely failed as Stan quickly found out that Future Stan was actually an actor.

In the supposed future painted by ""Future Stan"", after touching one marijuana joint, Stan's life spiraled down into a self-destructive series of events in which he became hooked on assorted drugs. He eventually ended up being sent to Juvenile Hall, during which he lost contact with his childhood friends. He would later be released and spend the rest of his life living on the streets, doing assorted and unspeakable things for drugs and booze. One night after falling asleep behind a crack-house, he got stuck in a time-matrix and was transported back into his own childhood. The Marsh family took him in upon his arrival.

In truth, ""Future Stan"" was nothing more than a professional stage actor associated with Motivation Corp., a company created by people who felt that, rather than speak honestly with kids about drugs, sex and other vices, parents could instead manipulate them with supposedly dismal futures involving time-travel. [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] and [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] hired Motivation Corp in hopes of doing this with Stan. Determined to keep the lie going, Randy went as far as to cut off ""Future Stan's"" hand when Stan pretended to cut his own hand off, possibly killing him.

Future Stan clearly looks like he's been living on the streets and has been addicted to drugs. He has long brown tattered hair, a black five o-clock shadow, brown eyebrows, and is slightly overweight. He wears similar clothes to Stan. He wears blue pants, a light blue shirt, and Stan's trademark red poof-ball hat. As of the end of ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"", Future Stan's actor is missing a hand due to Randy calling Stan's bluff.

When Stan refuses to be Gary's friend because of his religion, Gary responds with a very thoughtful speech about how proud he is to be Mormon and what it has done for him.

Finally, after hearing the story of ''The Book of Mormon'', Stan decides that Mormonism is ridiculous, and he no longer wants to be Gary's friend over his religion. The next day, he tells Stan off for being unable to look past his religion, telling him to ""suck my (his) balls"".

*'''Geoff Hamill:""''' ""Vagisil is very excited to be a part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.
*'''Geoff Hamill:""''' ""Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day. Every. Day. Every. Day. ...And available nationwide.""

Geoff created Vagisil for his wife Patty, whom he embarrasses in public, by telling everyone about her poor hygiene. After seeing [[Eric Cartman]], who made himself stupid by eating Vagisil and stealing a NASCAR to race, hires him to drive his stock car in the next NASCAR race for promotional purposes.

Geoff wears a grey/blue suit, red sweater, and a white formal shirt with a black tie. He has a short, gray beard, no mustache, and combed black hair.

Patty is Geoff Hamill's belittled wife. Because of all of the unwitting verbal abuse her husband has put upon her, she leaves him by stealing Jimmie Johnson's stock-car and as a result, beats Cartman in the race. This causes Geoff to breakdown and cry for all the lost publicity of his product.

Geological Survey Supervisor,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Geological_Survey_Supervisor,,"is the boss of the [[United States Geology Survey]] in Colorado, the former workplace of [[Randy Marsh]]. He first appear in [[Season Twelve]] episode ""[[About Last Night...]]"".

In ""[[About Last Night...]]"", a drunk Randy met his supervisor during a street celebration following [[Barack Obama]]'s victory in the 2008 Presidential Election. As the idea of ""change is coming to America"" gets over Randy's head, he proceeded to insult, flip the supervisor, before breaking his nose. In response, the supervisor fired him from his job the following day.

In ""[[The Cissy]]"", the supervisor appears to have re-hired Randy. He was pressured by Carol to create a separate bathroom for Randy (as Lorde), as many of the female geologists were not comfortable working with a transwoman, but Carol and the supervisor eventually agreed to let Lorde use the women's bathroom again.

The supervisor wears a green working suit with a black tie and black pants.

During the street celebration following Obama's victory, he is seen wearing a grey Obama/Biden shirt over his working attire.

George Lucas,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/George_Lucas,,"is the creator of the ''Star Wars'' franchise and the producer and writer of the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' movies.

George and [[Steven Spielberg]] seem to care more about changing their movies with new technology over what the fans want in the original films.

George is portrayed as a rapist of his past in ""[[Free Hat]]"" by destroying his movies with updated edits. Although when confronted by [[the boys]], he is almost convinced to give up re-working his movies, until Spielberg comes in and arrests the children.

In the episode, ""[[The China Probrem]]"", Lucas and Steven release their latest collaboration, ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull''.

As a result, the boys file a lawsuit against Lucas and Spielberg for ""class-1 rape"".

George usually wears a plaid shirt and blue jeans. He has a grey bushy beard and wild grey hair.

George Lucas appears as a lackey for Spielberg, who follows his ""master's"" lead without question.

George R. R. Martin,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/George_R._R._Martin,,"is an American author best known as the writer of the fantasy series ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', which is the basis of the television series ''Game of Thrones''. He was featured in the [[Season Seventeen]] episodes, ""[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]"" and ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"".

[[Eric Cartman|Wizard Eric]] sends [[Butters Stotch|Paladin Butters]] and [[Scott Malkinson]] to George Martin's house in a fact-finding mission on the outcome of the TV series ''Game of Thrones''. The mission was to enable Wizard Cartman the upper hand in getting Xbox Ones before anyone else on Black Friday. When Butters and Scott reach George's house, he annoys the two boys with his predilections rather than divulging anything that the boys need to complete their quest. After a literal ""song and dance"" the two boys have had enough and try to leave. Paladin Butters discloses his motivation to which George obliges by postponing Black Friday until December 6.

In ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"", George, who is supposed to cut the ribbon in front of the [[South Park Mall]] to officially start Black Friday, stalls by talking about wieners to the crowd. An [[Man with Brown Jacket|annoyed man]] cuts his penis off and then the ribbon, allowing the crowd into the mall.

George Raymond Richard Martin is stocky, has a grey beard, and a thick nose. He wears a black captains hat and glasses. He also wears a blue flannel shirt with suspenders and black shoes.

George seems to be infatuated with penises, as he writes about them incessantly in ''Game of Thrones'', goes on and on about them in conversation, and even shows his own penis (off-camera) to Butters and Scott. He also has his house filled with things that resemble penises and conducts a choir in a song about penises.

Martin is also shown to be a profligate liar, as he constantly promises things he has no intention of delivering, like pizzas and book sequels.

George W. Bush,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/George_W._Bush,,"was the 43rd President of the United States, serving from 2001 until 2009. He is a member of the American Republican Party along with his vice president [[Dick Cheney]]. He has made several prominent and cameo appearances.

President Bush is first seen deciding whether to give [[David Blaine]] and his followers tax-exempt status or not in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"". He is modeled on Timothy Bottoms' appearances as him in the series ''[[Wikipedia:That's My Bush!|That's My Bush!]]'', also created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. The rest of the cast of the series also appears alongside him.

In ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"", Bush is seen being convinced by government officials that [[Saddam Hussein]] is building weapons of mass destruction in Heaven, and plans an attack there. He then informs the United Nations of this, as well as why Saddam was in Heaven in the first place, to which he is questioned whether he is high or stupid, where he assures the United Nations that he is not high.

Bush reappeared with an updated design to resemble the real President in ""[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]"", in which he responded to the terrorists' threats to attack America over the appearance of [[Muhammad]] on the TV show ''[[Family Guy]]''. When the episode is aired uncensored, the terrorists send a video to the United States featuring George Bush, Jesus and U.S. citizens in which they are defecating on each other.

In the episode, ""[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]"", George Bush attempts to kill [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] for discovering the government's role in the September 11th terrorist attacks and stages an entire ruse to make it appear to be a conspiracy - at the end, however, it turns out the United States government had nothing to do with it, and the conspiracy idea is a conspiracy in itself.

Bush's original appearance has gray hair with different shades, black eyebrows, a wrinkly face with a large chin and half-lidded eyebrows while wearing a black suit with a blue tie. He is rather wide and obese. His later appearances have smoother gray hair and rectangular gray eyebrows with a thinner build, full eyes, and fewer wrinkles as well as a larger chin and different facial shape.

A speech on drug wars and people with integrity soon followed, with Randy claiming that [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|his farm]] would donate 100% of their profits to charities that work to right the wrongs of the drug war, until weed is legal nationwide.

George Washington appeared in a white-buttoned, blue coat and shirt, white blouse, and dark blue pants.

In ""[[World War Zimmerman]]"", he was asked by the government to shoot [[Tolkien Black]]. However, he shoots [[Eric Cartman]], who was in blackface, thinking he was an African-American. After they identify Cartman, Zimmerman is found guilty in court and is executed by electric chair.

In court, he wears a black business suit, which consists of a white shirt, black pants, and a dark blue tie with white stripes. When being executed, he wears an orange, prison jumpsuit. He has a mole under his nose, on the left side of his face.

Gerald Broflovski,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Gerald_Broflovski,,"is the husband of [[Sheila Broflovski]] and the father of [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Ike Broflovski]]. Operating under the alias of [[Skankhunt42]], he plays a key antagonistic role throughout [[Season Twenty]]. He is named after [[Matt Stone]]'s late father, Gerald W. Stone.

In ""[[Major Boobage]]"", he cheeses even though it is outlawed.
*'''Manslaughter:''' In ""[[The Damned]]"", he and many other trolls drive [[Freja Ollegard]] to suicide.
*'''Cyberbullying:''' Throughout Season 20, Gerald becomes notorious with his Skankhunt42 alias as he cyberbullies numerous people online.
*'''Murder:''' In ""[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]"", Gerald kills [[Lennart Bedrager]].
*'''Assault:''' Alongside killing Bedrager, he also assaults him by punching him in the groin.
*'''Arson:''' In ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"", he burns down 2 stores: Wall-Mart and Jim's Drugs.
*'''Assisting a crime:''' In ""[[Not Funny]]"", Gerald tells his son [[Ike Broflovski]] to log onto the school message board and cyberbully people, ultimately leading to Ike being accused of being [[Skankhunt42]] by his wife [[Sheila Broflovski]].

Gerald is a lawyer and a member of [[City Council]] as the city attorney. He has handled such legal matters as getting [[Chef]]'s name put on the album for [[Stinky Britches]] in ""[[Chef Aid]]"". He also helped Eric Cartman to successfully sue [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] after he called him an ""ass sucker"". He later abused his power as a lawyer in the same episode by persuading his clients to sue South Park Elementary. This counts as a Ponzi Scheme because Gerald scammed [[South Park Elementary]] and its students by making multiple false claims of sexual harassment, then using this as a scheme for millions of dollars. Shortly after, everyone started suing each other, causing the school to go bankrupt. In the episode ""[[Major Boobage]]"", he gets a law passed that cats are to be illegal in South Park, but he again abuses his power as a lawyer by breaking that law after he grounded Kyle for keeping a cat away from Kenny McCormick.

Gerald was seen driving a car best resembling a purple-red 2002 Lincoln Navigator in ""[[Asspen]]"", and in ""[[Smug Alert!]]"" he drives a [[Toyonda Pious]] with a license plate reading ""1TMYMPG""( 1TDespite being one of the adults with the most common sense, Gerald still has a criminal record.

He wears a magenta yarmulke, a khaki jacket with a blue shirt underneath as well as forest green trousers. He has brown hair with sideburns and a full beard trimmed into a point at the chin and shaved alongside the lips so that his mustache does not connect. On special occasions he is seen wearing a variant of his casual clothes but they instead consist of several different tones of black.

He has never been seen without his yarmulke on, except in ""[[Major Boobage]]"" which confirms that he is balding, and in ""[[Insecurity]]"" where he is wearing a UPS driver cap instead of a yarmulke. The fact that he is always seen wearing it would imply that he practices Orthodox Judaism, yet his liberal views and the fact that no other Jewish clothes are worn by him or his family implies that he is conservative or a member of a more progressive sect who wears it by choice.

He has been shown to have abundant chest hair; however, two hairless areas can be seen on it, one on each chest, presumably being the result of his sexual encounters with [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]].

Gerald seems to care about the environment and current events. He is typically portrayed to be kind and friendly, though he can be stubborn, sarcastic and impolite at times. Although he is seen as a primarily moral man, he is seen to get carried away with matters of money, which shows him to be corruptible, tempting him to do things he would normally find amoral and wrong, much to his shame.

In [[Season Twenty]], his corruptible side is shown as he is revealed to be the infamous internet troll known as [[Skankhunt42]]. He gleefully posts lewd and abysmal comments to young girls, and women in general. He was visibly shocked when his trolling caused [[Freja Ollegard]] to commit suicide, showing that he had no intentions of killing people. The source of this is that he likes to harass just for the pleasure of humiliating others and to feel when he used to bully as a kid.

Despite that, he seems to have reverted back to his kind, generous, friendly (if not stubborn, sarcastic and impolite still) ways. 

Gerald seems to be the most caring and rational of all the male parents in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He is concerned with Kyle learning about moral values. He will typically take up the same issues as his wife [[Sheila Broflovski]]. 

Gerald is named after Matt Stone's own father. In the show, Gerald is a lawyer, but in real life, Stone's father was an economics professor. 

In real life, Stone was raised as a non-practicing Jew and his father was Catholic, while in ''South Park'' the entire Broflovski family practices Judaism. Stone has advertently admitted that he knows nothing about Judaism, calling himself ""the worst Jew in the world"". Stone also has a sister named Rachel, but she is the family member of Stone's who is not represented on the show. While a character for Rachel was originally supposed to be intended, series creators Matt and [[Trey Parker|Trey]] deemed Stan and Kyle already too similar, so they created an adopted Canadian brother for Kyle.

Sheila tends to be overprotective of her children and goes to extremes to protect them from harm. She met Gerald in the US State of New Jersey and moved to South Park, Colorado so her children would not grow up in the dangerous big city.

[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is the only biological child of Gerald and Sheila. He is intelligent and has empathy for others. During the earlier seasons, Kyle was the one who was taunted and teased the most. In later seasons he has become a stronger figure who stands up for himself and others.

Ike, formerly Peter Gintz, was adopted from a family in [[Canada]]. He is very patriotic towards his home country and mature beyond his years. He enjoys watching the news on TV, went on strike for Canada, and has had an older girlfriend, [[Ms. Stevenson]]. He has also saved the Canadian Royal Wedding from [[Tooth Decay]].

In ""[[Chickenpox]]"", Stuart McCormick claims that Gerald was sent through school by ""rich parents,"" though the fact that Gerald had to work at a pizza place with Stuart and attend community college indicates that this is probably not true and is just a reflection of Stuart's jealousy, which is a plot point in the episode. Gerald grew up in South Park, where nobody in town is ever depicted as having more than a middle-class lifestyle other than the [[Tolkien Black|Black]] family, lending more credence to the idea that Gerald earned his own way through college.

So far, Gerald has had a speaking role in every season.

During his first appearance in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", Geraldo hosts a talk show ''Geraldo'', [[Eric Cartman]] becomes a guest on his talk show focusing on obesity, after he ate an excessive amount of weight gain powder, resulting in him becoming so fat, that he is unable to leave his home. In ""[[A Million Little Fibers]]"", Geraldo talks to [[Larry King]] live from Afghanistan as a war news correspondent on ''Larry King Live''. He exposes Stephen McTowelie, author of the book ''[[A Million Little Fibers (Book)|A Million Little Fibers]]'', as not being a person, but simply the towel.

He moves and speaks like a gay stereotype, with fluttery movements and flying wrists and an obvious lisp that gay stereotypes have. He is determined to find the answer on any case and does ridiculous poses on camera.

In his first appearance he wore a light blue shirt, a red bow tie, gray suspenders, and black pants. He had black hair with open bangs and black mustache. His appearance has changed a lot in ""[[A Million Little Fibers]]"" where he wears a pink shirt under a dark blue suit, dark blue pants, and black shoes. He also had some wrinkles on his face and thick eyebrows and his hair now has a hairstyle.

Girl with Blonde Hair,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Girl_with_Blonde_Hair,,"is an unnamed [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth-grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears as a background character in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, ""[[The List]]"". She is a member of the list-making committee.

She first appears in ""[[The List]]"" when the girls were discussing which girl has the cutest purse. When [[Millie Larsen]] submitted her opinion on two girls' purses, she responded to Millie by saying, ''""I don't think anyone disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Theresa's, but that doesn't make it the cutest.""'' [[Bebe]] then explains that the committee had already agreed that purses with stripes couldn't be in the top five cutest purses.

In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", she was shown talking to [[Annie Knitts]] before [[The Boys|the boys]] sang their song at the end.

In ""[[Super Fun Time]]"", she was shown many times in the background. In ""[[The Ring]]"", she and her two sisters watch the [[Jonas Brothers]]' 3D concert on TV with their parents.

She has short blonde hair that does a half-curl to the side at the bottom. She wears a navy blue coat with black buttons running down the front. She also wears a black skirt, which is rare among the 4th-grade girls, as [[Wendy Testaburger]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Red]], [[Annie Knitts]], [[Millie Larsen]], etc. all wear pants. The only regular background girls to wear skirts are [[Allie Nelson]], [[Monica Ryland]], and [[Theresa]].
The girl with blonde hair was portrayed as business-like in ""[[The List]]"", calmly arguing over who's purse is the cutest. However, this behavior is likely due to the committee itself and its rules, as all girls act similar while meeting.

In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", she is seen with Annie nearly every time she is shown. It is assumed they are friends.
She is represented as a semi-popular girl that is not part of Wendy's group of popular girls, but may be part of her extended group, because she is friends with some of the girls in Wendy's group. In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", when the whole school was singing, she was shown again singing beside Annie. It is displayed that these two are fairly good friends, and with Annie being popular, she is likely somewhat popular as well.

Glen wore a checkered plaid shirt and had distinctively curly hair. He also wore tan pants, a black belt, and had a long brown mustache.

He was similar in personality to any other resident, which could be seen during the town meeting in which he goes along with the various ideas of dealing with homeless overrunning the town. He also becomes very panicked when he finds out he is homeless, being very worried about his situation instead of the town's.

Glenn's wife called his cell phone to tell him they lost their home.

*'''Gloria:''' ""Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are. And we owe it all to me, and these six brave little boys (Kenny gets taken and eaten by a huge bird that appeared before)... five brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al.""
*'''Gloria:''' ""You can't do this! You homophobe!"" - To Big Gay Al.

Gloria speaks out on her talk show, accusing the Mountain Scouts of being homophobic. She takes the case to the Colorado Supreme Court, in support of [[Big Gay Al]], who was sacked from his job as a scout master for being homosexual. Big Gay Al wins the case but refuses to accept his job back. He believes that if he is allowed to express his homosexual nature, then the mountain scouts should be allowed to express their views on homosexuality. This angers Gloria and she accuses Big Gay Al of being a homophobe.

Gloria wears a yellow suit and has wavy brown hair. She has an exaggerated amount of make up and has noticeable signs of aging.

She is fiercely devoted to promoting equal rights, even going to outrageously claim Big Gay Al to be homophobic, despite being gay himself, showing she is ironically intolerant of those with different views to herself. She also seems quite arrogant and brash, voraciously professing all the credit for having defeated the scouts in the courts.

One of the things that is shown off is a Saturday morning cartoon starring Terrance and Phillip called ''Terrance and Phillip and the Land of the Goat People''. The group of Goat People shows up to confront them, with their leader telling them that he has seen nearly his entire species get wiped out by their gas, which Terrance and Phillip laugh at. The Goat People continue talking to them as the commentary goes on. Only the leader has a speaking role.

The Goat People are goats that stand on two legs. While their body shape appears the same between all of them, they have differently colored fur, such as greens, browns, and the leader having yellow-ish fur. They all wear gray vests and gray underwear. The leader's vest appears to have visible nipples on it and he has a long white goatee.

Gobbles,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Gobbles,,"is a disabled turkey that appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]"".

Gobbles was originally owned by farmer [[Bill Denkins]] but was bought by [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] because Denkins was going to kill him. They were looking for an entertaining turkey for the school Thanksgiving play, so Gobbles took up this role since they had spent all their budget.

He was named Gobbles by Timmy. Cartman and the other students consequently did not like him for his lack of capability and unusual appearance. However, Timmy quickly formed a close bond with Gobbles and he even jumped in front of the turkey and took a bullet when [[Jimbo Kern]] and his shooting companions tried to kill him.

With Timmy's training, he ends the play by ""jumping"" the flaming hoop of fire, instead of the professional turkey, which was shot and killed.

Gobbles is a turkey who has a neck problem. He is unable to lift his head for very long so consequentially his neck is always close to his feet. Ironically, this saves his life from a turkey slaughterhouse in the episode. Gobbles is also missing all its brown feathers.

God,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/God,,"is a supernatural celestial being and the father of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]. He first appeared in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"".

Jesus sought him out in order to make an appearance during the New Year's Eve millennium party. Everyone in town was expecting Jesus to do something special for the occasion, however, God refused to make an appearance on Earth. This left Jesus to decide to do something else for the millennium, as he desired to be liked by the populace once more.

However, things soon go awry and people prepare to crucify Jesus, again, and it is during this moment that Jesus realizes he shouldn't be so dependent on God to make him popular. Just then, God appears and decides to go through the millennium event with his son. He chooses to allow humanity to ask one question of him, however, the question is stolen by [[Stan Marsh]]. He then leaves and promises to return in the year 4000.

In ""[[Probably]]"", a desperate [[Satan]] seeks God's aid in getting rid of [[Saddam Hussein]], however, he verbally berates the devil for not being able to deal with his own affairs. God then tells Satan that he should break up with both Saddam and [[Chris]] and appreciate himself more before getting in a relationship.

In ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"", an imaginary version of God is mentioned by Superman.

God's personality draws a parallel between how many people and religions in the real world would perceive God. God is extremely wise, soft-spoken and all-knowing. It is extremely rare that he shows himself to people or, let alone, communicate with them in any way.

He is shown to be a short-legged squirrel, elephant, cat, hippopotamus tetra-morph with an extendable, reptile-like tongue. However, He claims that this is merely how humans perceive him, so his true form is unknown. He speaks with a deep, calm voice.

Gordon Stoltski,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Gordon_Stoltski,,"is a minor character who was first seen in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, ""[[Ginger Kids]]"". He was a 3rd grade student at [[South Park Elementary]] who was in charge of giving the morning announcements, until his death in the episode ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"".

In Gordon's first appearance in ""[[Ginger Kids]]"", he is among several discriminated redheads participating in [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s pro-ginger rally. He plays a significant role throughout the episode, being seen as a prominent follower of Cartman in the rally and giving a short talk at the [[Airport Hilton]] before introducing Cartman to the gingers. In the end, when the gingers are about to kill the non-redheaded kids, he is suspicious of Cartman's quick decision to change his plan after seeing [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] saying something privately to him. In this appearance, he is referred to as ""Jody"".

The character was later used in ""[[Fatbeard]]"", where he is first seen reading the morning announcements before being interrupted by Cartman and later getting kicked out of Cartman's pirate crew for being red-haired.

Gordon makes his final appearance in ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"", where he is gunned down during the morning announcements by a man who mistakes him for a 40-year-old truck driver, who is having an affair with his wife. This ends up causing the school body to do a memorial service for him and ask for someone to replace him.

Despite Gordon's death, his character is still used as a prop in the crowd of gingers in ""[[201]]"".

Gordon is a tall ginger boy with curly red hair, pale skin and several freckles on his face, as well as exaggeratedly orange lips. He wears a white ""Robot Warriors"" shirt with red edges and dark blue jeans.

Gordon's character is used as one of [[Scott Tenorman]]'s ginger minions that the player will face during the game.

Goth Kids,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Goth_Kids,,"Goth Kids''' are the group of goth children at [[South Park Elementary]]. Introduced in the episode ""[[Raisins]]"", they became regular background characters with occasional big roles including one episode where they even took over the title sequence and sung their own original version with new lyrics, the first characters to have done so.

They are usually seen hanging around the café [[Benny's]] and the [[Village Inn]]. They also hang out behind the school, near the loading bay and parking lot and in [[Henrietta's Bedroom]]. They all wear black clothes and eyeliner and have black hair and pale skin as well as being heavy smokers.

In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", they set fire to the South Park [[Hot Topic]] store, burning it to the ground.
*'''Attempted Murder:''' Firkle attempts to kill Mysterion in ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", but the [[Cthulhu Cult Leader]] does so instead.
*'''Attempted Murder / Kidnapping:''' In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", they kidnap [[Mike Makowski]], the leader of the [[South Park Vampire Society]], with the intent of murdering him. After he admits he isn't a vampire, however, they change their minds and ship him off to Scottsdale, Arizona instead.
*'''Drug Abuse / Underage Smoking: '''The Goth Kids are frequently seen smoking cigarettes despite their age (5 to 11), in addition to abusing cough syrup to hallucinate.
*'''Grand Theft Auto / Driving Without A License:''' In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", they take [[Harriet Biggle|Henrietta's mother]]'s car without her permission, and are clearly too young to have even a learner's permit.
*'''Hostage-Taking / Terrorism:''' In ""[[T.M.I.]]"" Michael participates in the Pissed Off and Angry Party's taking of hostages at the Fed-Ex offices.
*'''Treason / Sedition:''' In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", they are shown to be part of the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] and support the [[Cthulhu|eponymous monster's]] reign of terror. They later leave the cult, expressing dissatisfaction with the outcome.

was the first and currently only female goth kid. Her bedroom is another place where the Goths hang out where they read depressing poems about how much they hate conformists. Henrietta despises her mother because she usually interrupts Henrietta whenever she is reading a poem. Mrs. Biggle takes this as Henrietta's normal goth behavior. During the events of ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"", Henrietta's parents send her to a [[Troubled Acres|camp]] attempting to improve her attitude. The camp temporarily turns her [[Emo Kids|emo]], before she reverts to her usual goth self.

{{clear}}

is the oldest goth kid, in the fifth grade. In ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"", he helps [[The South Park Diggities|Stan's dance team]] out in an effort to be the biggest non-conformist of all by not even conforming to Goth standards. He also suggests bringing [[Yao]] into the group.

{{Clear}}

seems to be around the same age as Michael and Henrietta, and is in the fourth grade. He shows a little concern over the position he and the other goth kids are in when they were about to kill Mysterion. Despite not wanting to kill anyone he ends up going along with the other Goths after Michael says that killing is expected when you're a minion of Cthulhu.

{{Clear}}

is the youngest of the Goths, being in kindergarten. He says that most people are ""Nazi conformist cheerleaders"", and that he is the biggest non-conformist there is.

{{clear}}

is the second youngest of the Goths. She is the sister of [[Kenny McCormick]], and looks up to her fellow female goth, Henrietta. Although not initially a Goth kid, she becomes one after the events of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'s'' ""[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]"" DLC but this is not continued after the events of the game.

{{clear}}

The Goth Kids are very stereotypical goths. They rarely go to school and prefer to sit around all day drinking coffee and smoking. They constantly go on about how pointless and painful life is. They go to the cemetery often, where they write poems about death and sorrow. They take to calling those who are not goths ""[[Britney Spears|Britney (Spears)]] and [[Justin Timberlake|Justin (Timberlake)]] wannabes"". They also dance by looking down at the ground, with their hands at their sides, and every three seconds they take a drag on their cigarettes.

To them, everyone who follows along with life as usual and the path of average citizens are ""conformists"", whom they despise, they state that their purpose in life is to make life more miserable for the conformists. They hate the South Park Vampire Society more than conformists, as everyone else mistakes them for being vampires rather than Goth.
They have also joined a cult group that worships [[Cthulhu]] and is involved with the [[Necronomicon]]. [[Coon and Friends]] figure this is because the cult's ideals fit in with their goth lifestyle. However, they quickly leave the cult after seeing nothing has changed and assist [[Mysterion]] in learning Cthulhu's weakness.

Despite hating conformists, [[Michael]] ironically tells [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] in ""[[Raisins]]"" that in order to hang out with them, he would have to dress like them and do whatever they do.

The goth kids also are into gothic literature as well, including the author [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and HP Lovecraft. They also have an interest in gothic rock, post-punk, darkwave, and industrial music.

[[Henrietta Biggle|Henrietta]]'s name was given officially in the [[Season Seven]] episode, ""[[Raisins]]"". [[Pete]], Michael, and [[Firkle Smith|Firkle]], however, did not have their names revealed until the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"". Firkle's real name was revealed to be Georgie Smith in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, ""[[Franchise Prequel]]"". In ""[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]"" when taking a picture with the goths, Pete's last name is revealed to be ""Thelman"". However there is apparently another background character with the exact same name, causing much confusion among fans. 

The Goth Kids have collectively and individually engaged in numerous criminal offences.
Their most common hang-out spot is the loading bay behind [[South Park Elementary]]. This is where the Goth Kids are first introduced when Stan Marsh requests to join them in ""[[Raisins]]"". This is where the Goth Kids are situated in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''. They sit there and smoke and listen to Goth music.

The Goth Kids regularly hang-out in Henrietta's bedroom to sit in the dark, read gothic literature, write and perform poems about pain and dabble in the occult. The room is very dark and decked out with band posters, candles, skulls and other gothic items. Henrietta's mom often enters the room and interrupts much to Henrietta's dismay. This seems to be the only one of the Goth Kid's bedrooms they all get together at. This is where the Goth Kids are situated in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

This diner was a former hang-out spot where the Goth Kids spent time drinking coffee and were often scolded by the waitress working there for spending all day sitting there drinking coffee.

This diner is the Goth Kids new hang-out spot to drink coffee. The interior is identical to Benny's and features the same hostile waitress so it's possibly the same building under new management though exterior shots do not match the background. This is likely just a continuity error.

Henrietta, Michael, Pete and Firkle can be found smoking and listening to Goth music at the Loading Bay behind [[South Park Elementary]]. They give [[The New Kid]] various missions to prove he's not a comformist such as dressing goth, being able to dance goth and holding up a sign saying ""Fuck the Comformists"" at a PTA meeting.

Henrietta, Michael, Pete and Firkle can be found in Henrietta's bedroom where they give [[The New Kid]] a mini side-quest to find the sacred tome and light the sacred candles to summon a chest in a flaming pentagram where upon opening you receive a reward of an arcane suit and goth bangs. The Goth Kids express disappointment in this underwhelming result.

Henrietta appears in ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'' mission as a new ally and helps rescue [[Mysterion]]'s younger sister [[Karen McCormick]] from the [[South Park Vampire Society|Vampire Kids]]. Karen briefly becomes a Goth Kid at the end of the mission after befriending Henrietta who shows her how to be goth though this plot point is never touched upon again.

Henrietta, Michael, Pete, and Firkle appear as [[South Park: Phone Destroyer/Cards|Neutral Cards]] in the game.

She only made one on-screen appearance which was in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"", although she has been mentioned in dialog in other episodes.

When Stan's friends [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] create a [[Facebook]] for him against his will, Stan begins to become assaulted by Facebook-type requests from everyone around him, including his grandmother. Apparently suffering from some sort of illness and hospitalized, Grandma Marsh spends much of her time on Facebook to keep in-contact with her family and friends. However, when Stan does not immediately ""friend"" her, she contacts her son Randy who then demands that he pay attention to his grandma's Facebook status.

Later when Stan is literally ""sucked into"" Facebook, a digital avatar of his grandmother is seen interacting with all of his other Facebook friends, at a digital party created by his now sentient Facebook profile. Once Stan defeats his Facebook profile in a game of Yahtzee, she and everyone else on Stan's friends list are transferred to [[Kip Drordy]].

It's likely she and Marvin are divorced since they don't live at Shady Acres together and she's hardly mentioned by Marvin and Randy.

Despite her failing health and the suggested age of Grandma Marsh, she appears to remain relatively younger than Marvin. She has grayish white hair and glasses. However, due the fact that Grandma Marsh has only appeared as a digital avatar character in the techno-world of Facebook, her appearance may not exactly be accurate to her current state. Also she is not seen wearing normal attire, but instead she is seen wearing a Tron-like costume of glowing technology.

She created an unnamed alter-ego after she discovered Butters' ""[[Professor Chaos (Character)|gay little costume]]"".

Grandma Stotch wears dark green pants, a pink shirt, a green and white hooded jacket, and dark green earrings. She has short, white hair, and is visibly aged. She now wears a purple and orange track outfit with ""GRANDMAS RULE!"" printed on the shirt, and a blue bracelet.

Although she seems to be compassionate around other people, Grandma Stotch enjoys tormenting Butters. In the episode ""[[Butterballs]]"", she physically and psychologically abuses her grandson when no other person is present. She bullies Butters by beating him, robbing his lunch money, and gave him ""gummy bears"" (putting a part of his body in her toothless mouth). 

Grandma Stotch appears to ""change"" after Butters tells her that someday she will die and he will keep living, likely making her cruelty temporary.

Gregory, who is portrayed with both an upper-class English accent and stereotypical traits of the English, has caught [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s romantic attention and became in a relationship with her. Wendy denies this to [[Stan Marsh]] and kisses him instead, later implying that her feelings for Gregory were merely a strong admiration and never cared for him.

Along with him mentioning he has a 4.0-grade point average, he is a very independent leader to the schoolchildren and has guided them over.

Gregory has quite a singing voice as shown in the song ""[[La Resistance]]"".

He has thick, curly blonde hair. He wears an orange blouse, brown trousers, and black gloves. He also carried a cutlass during ""[[La Resistance]]"".

Though Gregory is portrayed as a smart and thoughtful young boy, he is also quite arrogant and looks down upon [[The Boys|the other boys]]. This consequently causes Wendy to say to Stan at the end of the movie: ""Fuck Gregory! Fuck him right in the ear!"", meaning that she never liked him after all. It is also ironic of him being friends with [[The Mole]], because of the British and French enmity within the show.

Gregory was briefly friends with Wendy in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. They shared the same liberal, political views. Their relationship was devoid of any romantic feelings, which Wendy clarified to Stan towards the end of the movie.

Although Gregory seems to take an instant disliking to the boys, because they are not very political, and can act rather childish at times, he is the one who points the boys towards ""[[The Mole]]"", so they can free [[Terrance and Phillip]] from Sheila's organization, [[Mothers Against Canada]].

Furious, the Harley riders attempt to stop the word ""fag"" from officially referring to them, but instead accept the meaning, and the word officially becomes associated with them:

He is usually accompanied by his partner [[Mitch Murphy]] or generic police officers.

He first appears as a member of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], but has since been seen as part of the Park County Police, a role he has consistently kept in the [[South Park|series]] since then.

A police officer with a similar design to Yates appears working under [[Lieutenant Dawson]] in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"" as a background character.

In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", he appears as a member of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] investigating illegal music downloads online, helping [[Stan Marsh|Stan,]] [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] realize that their downloads are hurting musicians' careers

In ""[[Casa Bonita]]"" he appears at the [[Park County Police Force]] leading the investigation into [[Butters Stotch]]'s disappearance and is involving in pursuing [[Eric Cartman]] when his lies are uncovered.

The character received his formal introduction in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", where he is first depicted unambiguously as the lead detective in the [[Park County Police Force]], mentioning having served for twenty-five years, with his name being used for the first time, his partner Mitch and his wife [[Maggie Yates|Maggie]] also being introduced. After [[Michael Jackson]] (also known as Mr. Jefferson) moves into South Park, he and the other detectives try to frame him as the file claims he is a wealthy black man. He then panics and becomes disillusioned when he sees Jefferson, believing him to be white, and is concerned he may have sent an innocent man to jail who was not black. After a pep talk from his wife, he resumes his investigation, but when Jefferson decides to give away all of his money, Yates lets him go, having no need to put another poor black man in jail.

In ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"", when a serial killer strikes South Park, Yates is desperate for answers and begins turning to psychics. He becomes convinced that Cartman has psychic powers that can capture the killer and dismisses proven science such as fingerprinting and blood analysis as ""Hocus Pocus"". As a result, he arrests and even kills a number of innocent people based on Cartman's alleged ""psychic visions"", failing to identify the killer as such when he first investigates him, despite an overabundance of evidence. He does ultimately put this aside and use 'good old fashioned police work' to help apprehend the [[Michael Deets|Left Hand Killer.]]

In ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] reports to Yates and the cops that the Kindergarten teacher, [[Ms. Stevenson]], is in a relationship with his younger brother, [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]]. It is shown that Yates and his pals, like all the other men in South Park do not see anything wrong with women committing sex crimes like this one. At one point he remarked that he would have gladly hooked up with a sexed-up teacher when he was a kid, again proving to be more of a hindrance than anything else to the case.

In ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", he went undercover as a prostitute after learning of an increase in South Park prostitutes. Though it was obvious when he was a man in drag (he retained his male sexual organs, his mustache, and his hairy body), no one seemed to notice this or at least chose to ignore it. He also is unaware of the fact he doesn't need to have sex with the Johns to arrest them for soliciting prostitution, something that creeps out the rest of his squad. He seems to take his role so seriously that he not only has sex with his Johns, he also is involved in a bareback gang-bang with dozens of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity men at the college, and he also ""falls in love"" with his pimp, runs off to [[Switzerland]], is married for a year before at last arresting him.

In ""[[The Coon]]"", Yates is the primary police officer approached by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] in the guise of the Coon. While he seems to see the Coon as an annoyance and tells him to leave, Yates praises the assistance and work of the town's other hero, [[Mysterion]], despite neither hero doing much to assist the police force themselves and the lack of response by them to either hero.

Yates has orange hair, an orange mustache, and thick orange eyebrows. He wears a white button-up shirt, black tie, black suspenders, gold watch, a belt with a gold buckle, and in a brown leather holster his stainless Smith and Wesson 5900-series pistol with wood grips (as does his partner Mitch Murphy, indicating this is most likely the standard issue duty sidearm for South Park PD) As a prostitute, he wore a short red skirt, a red bra, and a blonde wig.

Yates appears to be rather gullible and believes in the supernatural, and often wastes time by conducting extremely trivial investigations. He seems to enjoy letting other people solve crimes for him, be they supposed psychic mediums, the [[Hardly Boys]], [[Butters Stotch]], or [[Mysterion]] (Kenny). He is also stupid (possibly slightly more so than Officer Barbrady), racist and misogynistic, the last two of which he is perfectly willing to misuse the law to satisfy.

Like most other South Park citizens, however, he does not notice these negative traits or rather believes they are good. His microscopic intelligence is showcased when it took him (presumably) hours of extensive research to understand that a left-hand remains as such, regardless of the angle of which it's seen.

There is a possibility that he is a closet homosexual or at least bisexual, as depicted in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", where he takes his prostitute role way too seriously by engaging in sexual contact with multiple male clients and marries his pimp in order to arrest him. However, it is possible that he was just taking his job too far without having any sexual feelings for the said men. In ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"", he suggests he ""might even kiss a dude"" while hula dancing, further adding to the speculation.

He seems to show intolerance towards wealthy African-Americans especially the Black family. In ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", he gets deeply disgusted when he finds out [[Michael Jackson|Mr. Jefferson]] was actually an African American man. In ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"", he accidentally shoots Tolkien and shows no remorse for his actions. Harrison also refers to Tolkien as the patient zero for [[COVID-19]] at [[South Park Elementary]]. In ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars Part 2]]'', rather than fully investigating [[Steve]]'s disappearance, he shows up to [[Credigree Weed]] to tell [[Linda Black]] about her husband's presumed death but shows no empathy.

He is married to [[Maggie Yates]], who shares his views on rich black men, as she supported him in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"". She is very supportive and encouraging towards him throughout her appearances in later episodes. Ironically, in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"" he engages in a long-term affair with a wealthy black man, [[Keshawn]], citing him to be his ""pimp"".

He has an unnamed son, mentioned in ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"" as enjoying cutting women's eyes out of photographs.

Yates appears in the police office as a ""friendable"" friend. He sends the player to collect five rings from the [[Nazi Zombies|Nazi zombies]]. When the player collects the rings, Yates befriends him. Yates cannot be befriended when the Nazi zombies disappear.

Sergeant Yates has a bigger role in ''The Fractured But Whole'' as he works under [[Mitch Conner]]. He gives [[the New Kid]] two successive missions on the second day: [[Operation: Just 'Cause]] and [[Operation: Blind Justice]], both of which are about arresting black people for apparently no reason. After completion, he becomes the New Kid's [[Coonstagram (App)|Coonstagram]] follower.

His prominent role in this game takes place during [[The Thin White Line]] mission. As the New Kid fights further into [[Park County Police Station|the police station]], he consistently tries to explain that he is not a racist. After all the horrible truth turns out to be, that Yates and his fellow cops are Outer-God worshipers. He engages himself in the boss fight against [[Shub-Niggurath]], and is beatable.

Yates also appears in [[Danger Deck]] as an enemy.

Following his testimony, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] enters the meeting and asserts that alcoholism is not a disease, to which Harry states otherwise.

At the [[Whistlin' Willy's]], members of AA discover through a news report that the bleeding of a Virgin Mary statue, which many of them had visited to cure their alcoholism, was found not to be a miracle.

Harvey Brown,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Harvey_Brown,,"was the president and co-founder of Wall-Mart in ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"". [[The Boys]] found him brooding in a bar near the Wall-Mart headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. He told the boys that the only way to kill a Wall-Mart was to destroy its heart (a glass mirror near the television department). His guilt got the best of him, and he then committed suicide, asking the boys to tell the world that he was sorry. Thanks to his help, [[Randy Marsh|Randy]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] were able to destroy the Wall-Mart in South Park.

He has graying brown hair, and bags under his eyes, presumably from the guilt of opening [[Wall-Mart]]. He wore a white, button-up undershirt, brown coat, a messily put on brown tie, and brown pants.

In ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"", he was incredibly remorseful and guilty over establishing a one-stop super store like Wall-Mart in 1987, only for it to go out of control and form a mind of its own in four years, becoming extremely depressed and eventually shooting himself.

He also appears as a background character in the [[Season Seven]] episode, ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"", the [[Season Eight]] episode ""[[Goobacks]]"" and the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode ""[[White People Renovating Houses]]"".

Hat McCullogh was initially imprisoned for murdering 23 babies in ""self defense"". The rednecks of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] misunderstood the advertisement, for a literal ""free hat"", and petitioned the governor to release McCullough. Stan's campaign was actually meant to save films from their directors, who perform unnecessary modifications and re-release them.

His advertising sign actually promised free hats for anyone participating in his campaign, instead of an appeal to release a McCullough from jail. Hat McCullough was later released around the same time Stan's original campaign's goal was achieved, so his release was credited to [[The Boys|the boys]] for their supposed campaign. On the stage, he expresses spasms of insanity, shouting, ""Kill! Kill the innocent!"" and ""Rape the virgins!"", while thanking the rednecks for their support, then asking for a baby. He gets the fearful toddler, and then performs horrid actions upon it, causing [[Tweek Tweak]] to look and shout, ""Oh my God!""

He is seen again in the crowd of ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"" as a war supporter and singing in the final celebration scene.

Heidi went from being a minor background character that was introduced in [[Season Three]] to a much larger presence in ''[[South Park]]''. Like other characters used mostly in the background of the early seasons, her model would be used to fill in space and was occasionally given color swaps.

Later, as the series progressed, Heidi was given a permanent color scheme and eventually a name, making her more usable for recurring roles. She obtained further establishment in the episode ""[[Marjorine]]"", where she was shown more prominently, hosting a slumber party. In the episode, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] shows the male 4th graders a recording in which the girls, including Heidi, are seen using a ""fortune-telling device"". During Cartman's meeting, Heidi's full name is revealed for the first time. Cartman tells the boys that Heidi will be hosting a slumber party which will be a perfect opportunity for them to take the ""fortune-telling device"" from the girls, as well as learn out how to use it. The boys decide to set up [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' fake death and send him to the party disguised as a girl. After Butters' fake death, he arrives at [[South Park Elementary]] dressed as a girl and introduces himself to the class as [[Marjorine (Character)|Marjorine]]. Heidi is seen in [[Herbert Garrison|Ms. Garrison]]'s class for the first time.

[[File:Marjorine38.png|thumb|left|Heidi makes preparations for the slumber party.]]
[[Nancy Turner]] tells her that she also invited Marjorine to the party, much to Heidi's anger. At the party, all the girls pick on Marjorine for being ugly and flat with Heidi telling her that nobody wants her at the party and that she should leave. After the girls hear Marjorine crying in the bathroom, they apologize and decide to give her a makeover. Heidi gives Marjorine the ""fortune-telling device"" and teaches her how to use it, but after [[Thomas Turner]] revealed that there is a boy at the party. Marjorine takes the device and leaves.

Since then, she has kept her place in the girls' clique throughout the series. Her role had seemed to be gradually growing, but had not dropped off until ""[[The Hobbit]]"". Heidi became a key character in [[Season Twenty]], as she was forced off of social media by the internet troll [[Skankhunt42]], and eventually became Eric Cartman's girlfriend, joining with him to end the gender war engulfing the school.

In ""[[Member Berries]]"", before the volleyball game, she sits down during the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|American National Anthem]] and plays with the team. After the game, she asks [[PC Principal]] what he will do about Cartman, assuming he is lying about [[Skankhunt42]] and requests that PC Principal checks Cartman's phone. 

[[File:SkankHunt00005.png|thumb|Heidi tosses her phone into the river.]]
She quits social media in a dramatic way, by tossing her phone into the river in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"". The next day, she walks down the hallway with her head down as [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] tells [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] that she has quit Twitter for good. Heidi can be seen sitting in the library during [[Mr. Mackey]]'s Twitter funeral for her. When the girls are talking about taking action against Skankhunt42 on the playground, Heidi is standing with them. 

During ""[[The Damned]]"", when Cartman is walking alone in the hallway, Heidi calls to him and leads him to the park where she and other people who do not use Twitter go. There, she comforts him about his broken electronics after showing him the park. Later, she apologizes for accusing Cartman of being Skankhunt42, talks with him about his assembly, and becomes his friend. The next day, Heidi talks with Cartman about her lack of followers. At [[M Burgers]], Cartman and Heidi eat together. When he asks her if girls have balls, she offers to show him her vagina. 

She is seen in a relationship with Cartman during ""[[Wieners Out]]"", bringing him chocolate milk and receiving a necklace from him. At [[Sizzler]], Cartman and Heidi hold hands while talking with Kyle about the gains of women and Butters needing to be stopped. Cartman becomes defensive of her when Kyle says ""we need the old Cartman back"", thinking that he has an issue with his relationship with her. Heidi tells Kyle that the two of them are ""out of it now"" after leaving social media behind. 

[[File:DoucheAndADanish00005.png|thumb|left|Heidi and Cartman interrupt the fight between Nelly and Butters.]]
In ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"", Heidi delays the fight between [[Nelly]] and Butters with Cartman, giving him a kiss. She holds an assembly with Cartman to propose the idea of a school fundraiser for [[TrollTrace.com]] to stop the cyberbullying issues in South Park and the rest of the world. She talks about her school fundraiser, Danishes for Denmark, in [[Mrs. Nelson]]'s class before Mr. Garrison tries to teach the class, pretending that he is not running for president. While the students help with Danishes for Denmark, Heidi and Cartman sing ""[[Let's Come Together As a School]]"" together. Due to the [[List of Internet Trolls]] attacking [[Denmark]], nobody wants to buy danishes from Heidi's school fundraiser. Heidi runs away and cries when she realized her plan failed, resulting in Cartman comforting her. Later, she and Cartman send a VHS to Denmark in which she believes to know the source of the troll attack. 

At M Burgers, Heidi goes on a date with Cartman and talks with him about Kyle, worried about his relationship with Cartman and the rest of the boys during the events of ""[[Fort Collins]]"". Heidi and Cartman talk with Kyle in his bathroom about their plans with Denmark. She invites Kyle to her house, revealing her plan to identify Skankhunt42 using ""Emoji Analysis"", telling Cartman and Kyle she thinks Skankhunt42 is a student's parent. A Danish worker mentions her and her Emoji Analysis, helping the Danish locate the source of the troll attack. Heidi is mentioned when Kyle tells Cartman about the possibility of her finding out about his internet history. Cartman later lies to her to keep his internet history secret, and she believes him. 

During ""[[Oh, Jeez]]"", Heidi and Cartman sit on their park bench and talk about the results of the election. Cartman says he is scared for the future and Heidi agrees. Cartman talks with Heidi in her room and convinces her that going to Mars is the only way to save themselves from mankind's destruction. She says that she trusts him with everything she has and agrees to come along. She joins Cartman on his quest to go to Mars by walking to [[SpaceX]]'s headquarters, unaware of his plan to avoid getting his internet history being exposed. 

[[File:Heidi Emoji Analysis.png|thumb|Heidi's Emoji Analysis.]]
In ""[[Members Only]]"", Heidi and Cartman ask the SpaceX receptionist if they can go to Mars, but they end up having to wait in line. Heidi tells Cartman that she will miss everyone on Earth if they leave, reluctant to follow through with his plan. Cartman becomes defensive of Heidi when Butters claims to be feminist and asks her to tell him a joke. When the tour ends, Butters tells Elon Musk that Heidi might be able to help get to Mars sooner because she is really smart and really funny. When Kyle confronts Ike about Skankhunt42, he remembers Heidi's Emoji Analysis and figures out who the real troll is, realizing that Ike is not Skankhunt42. 

When Gerald FaceTime calls Ike, Kyle mentions that Heidi figured out Gerald was Skankhunt42 by using her Emoji Analysis in ""[[Not Funny]]"". Heidi admits that she does not know what the problem is with Elon's rocket science. Cartman reassures Elon that she is the funniest, smartest girl on Earth and gets mad at Butters when he compliments her. When Cartman tells Butters to back off because Heidi is everything to him, Butters tells him that girlfriends only want to make guys sad, but Cartman does not believe him. While Heidi is attempting to solve the problem, Cartman talks to Butters again, he tells Butters that Heidi is the smartest, funniest person he has ever met, not believing Butters about the girls' ""hatred"" for men. She uses Emoji Analysis to solve the rocket science problem, all while Cartman is trying to convince himself that she is still funny, not only smart. 

In Season Twenty's final episode, ""[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]"", she admires the new energy source she helped create. Elon Musk walks away with her while Cartman's distrust in her grows even more. Heidi waves at Cartman through the window as Cartman attempts to convince Elon that women will take over the operation. Cartman mentions Heidi when talking to Butters, saying that he cannot live without her but does not want to be enslaved on Mars. Heidi tells Cartman that he seems distant, to which he apologizes and distracts her from the energy source being re-routed. Heidi thinks she is acting needy and Cartman agrees to be honest with her, even if it hurts her feelings. Heidi and Cartman watch SpaceX explode after the energy source was re-routed to the internet. Later, Heidi walks home with Cartman, leaving him with a kiss, only for him to wipe it off his face with a bitter expression. 

[[File:WPRH66.PNG|thumb|left|Heidi tells Cartman that ""relationships are 50/50.""]]
The first episode of Season 21, ""[[White People Renovating Houses]]"", explores the negative side of Heidi and Cartman's relationship. While Cartman and his friends are making [[Alexa]] say profanities, Heidi enters his house resulting in Cartman acting passive-aggressively towards her, annoying Heidi. Heidi then leaves his house, angry that he would not communicate his feelings. Later that night, Heidi calls Cartman and notes that he said ""mobile phones are the devil"", despite him using his phone regularly. He hangs up, annoyed, after wishing her a goodnight. Cartman mentions her to the guys when telling them that she changes like ""Jekyll and Hyde"" and ""mentally abuses"" him, claiming that she needs help, even though his claims are not true. Heidi is crying at her dining room table when Cartman comes and admits that he was wrong. When Heidi tells him that ""relationships are 50/50"", he becomes annoyed and tries to end their conversation quickly, mocking her on his way out when she says ""I love you too"". When he walks down the street, Heidi appears in his mind, expressing how she wants more communication in their relationship. Heidi later goes to Cartman's house and asks Liane to tell him that she wants to make him happy and she was wrong to say that ""relationships are 50/50"", they are ""100/100"", and she will put in one-hundred percent each day, that she will try harder. She wants Cartman to know that it is okay to be sad because ""the sun will come out again"". Cartman breaks up with her for not submitting herself to him, telling her that she is messed up and he cannot fix her. This leaves Heidi confused as he happily walks away. 

During the events of ""[[Put It Down]]"", when Cartman is giving Craig relationship advice, Heidi walks up to Cartman and asks him if they will spend time together at recess. Then, the boys ask him about their relationship, he claims that he took her back because she threatened suicide, even though she is still ""mentally abusive"", which is false. Heidi talks with Stan about Cartman because she is worried about him, telling him that after she and Cartman broke up, he said he was going to kill himself. She sends Cartman's voicemail to Stan, worried about Cartman's mental state. Cartman becomes angry about this and decides to make an anti-suicide campaign for himself. She helps Cartman raise his suicide awareness by holding a boombox while he sings [[Give Life A Try]]. In his song, he claims that his relationship with Heidi is like ""livin' in quicksand"" and she was messed up. When Cartman is trying to spread his suicide awareness outside the grocery store, Heidi helps pass out fliers. Later, Heidi tells Cartman that his website is becoming popular with others who need help, Cartman blames her for making him want to commit suicide. When Cartman tries to make his suicide prevention event bigger than the memorial service by the [[Distracted Driving Awareness|Distracted Driving Awareness Group]], Heidi tells him that ""people need help sorting out their emotions sometimes"", resulting in Cartman threatening to kill himself and running away. During Cartman's solo in ""[[Put It Down (Song)|Put It Down]]"", Heidi can be seen standing next to him when rapping about her making him crazy. 

[[File:SPFP48.png|thumb|Heidi asks Cartman what he was up to.]]
Although Heidi has a very small role in ""[[Franchise Prequel]]"", her relationship with Cartman becomes even more strained. While [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] gives his friends a motivational speech, she walks up to him and asks what he was up to, resulting in Cartman deflating. She then asks Cartman if he still wants to go to the park with her, cancelling the plans and leaving when Cartman acts passive-aggressively towards her. 

In ""[[Hummels & Heroin]]"", Heidi can be seen supporting [[Marcus Preston]] and his cause. Even though she only appears briefly, she does want something done about the opioid issue in South Park. 

Season 21's Halloween special, ""[[Sons A Witches]]"" explores the rising toxicity in Heidi and Cartman's relationship even more. Heidi takes a long time getting ready for their trip to the pumpkin patch, resulting in Cartman getting upset with her. Heidi, noticing that he is upset, asks if something is bothering him. When they are about to leave her house, Heidi asks for a picture, resulting in Cartman getting frustrated when she runs back inside to get her bracelet. When they do get to the pumpkin patch, they show up too late, making Cartman angrier. When [[Chip Duncan]] attacks the pumpkin patch, Heidi and Cartman are forced to leave, requiring Heidi to pull Cartman away from the pumpkin patch to get to safety. When they boys are talking about last night's witch attacks, Cartman glares at Heidi, angry about what happened the night before. She waves to him and he waves back, not breaking his gaze until Butters says ""we've got to do something to get rid of her"". Assuming they were talking about Heidi, he agrees with Butters. Later, he shows Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kenny his plan to kill Heidi. Kyle gets angry because they want to get rid of the witch, not Heidi. Cartman says that Heidi makes his life ""a living hell"" and Kyle tells him to break up with her because ""Heidi's a nice girl"", astonished how Cartman can treat her so badly. Cartman says that she has ""no time-management skills whatsoever"" and angrily leaves. When Mayor McDaniels holds an assembly about the issues the witch has caused in South Park, Cartman comes up with the idea of getting Heidi captured by the witch. Cartman tricks Heidi into coming with him to a ""costume party"" during school. Dressed as Hansel and Gretel, they walk through the forest. Heidi remembers that Cartman was angry she took so long getting ready for pumpkin patch, starting an argument. As revenge, Cartman leaves her alone and she gets captured by the witch. She is later rescued when President Garrison's orbital cannon kills Chip, taking extra time to leave the witch's bag. On Halloween, Cartman is waiting for Heidi to get ready for Trick-or-Treating and she takes her time, resulting in Cartman becoming annoyed once again. 
[[File:Sp-2107-press-art-image-01.jpg|thumb|left|Cartman introduces Heidi to ""Beyond KFC""]]
In ""[[Doubling Down]]"", Cartman manipulates Heidi even more, further increasing the toxicity of their relationship. Heidi gets a call from Cartman and becomes annoyed when he cries into the phone, begging her to take him back. Heidi says that he called her a whore and tried pushing her in front of a car, so he blames it on his poor diet. Heidi tells him that he can not be mean to her and keep blaming it on his diet, so he blames his mother and yells at her. Heidi suggests a vegan diet, so he agrees to become vegan to get back with her. Cartman gets angry when Heidi packs his vegan lunch, calling her a ""manipulative whore"". Kyle gets mad at Cartman for calling Heidi such terrible things, confused why she still wants to be with him and Heidi walks up, offering to eat with Cartman and explain what she packed in his lunch. After school, Kyle talks to Heidi about her relationship with Cartman. She gets defensive when Kyle asks her why she is still with Cartman. At Heidi's house, Cartman tricks her into eating ""Beyond KFC"", ruining her vegan lifestyle with meat. In the hallway, Kyle thinks he knows why Heidi would not admit Cartman is a bad boyfriend. Butters thinks that Heidi could be telling the truth when Cartman asks if they have seen her recently. Cartman tells them that the have been trying new foods and Heidi has been gaining weight and she says that the ""Beyond Arby's"" might have made her feel sick. He makes weight jokes about her when she talks about leaving school. Kyle says that they need to help her after seeing what Cartman has been doing to her. Kyle talks with the girls about making Heidi feel bad about being with Cartman because she will double down, trying harder to prove that she did not make a bad decision. Butters thinks that Kyle was right before and that the boys should help Heidi break up, but Kyle tells him that they should stay out of it. Kyle then talks to Cartman about his relationship with Heidi, but he pulls out a drum and starts making fun of her weight. Kyle sees Heidi sitting alone in the school gym and talks to her about Cartman. She tells him that she keeps thinking Cartman will change, but Kyle tells her that people like Cartman always see themselves as the victims. He says that Cartman will always find someone to blame for his flaws and he will never change. She tells Kyle the circumstances she was in when she started dating Cartman. She then tells Kyle why she started dating Cartman, asking if that makes her a bad person. Kyle assures her that good people make bad decisions everyday. Heidi then has a montage with ''[[Unfaithful]]'' where she looks through a scrapbook of pictures she and Cartman took, she notices Kyle looking at her at school, she and Cartman are talking at the park bench and she leaves him, but he grabs onto her leg to slow her down, then Kyle gets a letter from Heidi and smiles after reading it, then Cartman bangs on the window to a restaurant Heidi and her parents are eating at, begging her to take him back. Kyle and Heidi talk with each other on the playground's swings. At [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]]'s family dinner, Cartman finds out that Heidi has been dating Kyle. He then imagines Kyle as a giant, attempting to ruin his relationship with her. The next day, Cartman fights Kyle at school because he is dating Heidi, but goes down in one punch. Heidi eats at [[Buca De Faggoncini]] with the girls, but they continue to make her feel bad about dating Cartman so she decides to meet him at the park. Cartman takes her back and twists her beliefs, causing her to inadvertently call Kyle a ""dirty Jew"" and break up with him.

[[File:SPMP - 00180.png|thumb|Heidi speaking at the podium.]]
""[[Moss Piglets]]"" shows how her toxic relationship with Cartman has changed her life for the worst. She now resembles Cartman and acts similarly to him. At lunch, [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] notes that ""you become more and more like the person you're with and, I guess it's true with Heidi"". She then sits down with the girls and asks them what they are talking about. When they do not tell her, she accuses them of being ""judgemental bitches"". When Wendy tries to talk with her about her appearance, Heidi becomes aggressive towards her. After [[Theresa]] intervenes, Heidi mocks her. [[Mr. Mackey]] meets with her in his office to talk with her about judging the Special Ed Science Fair. At the bus stop, Heidi is standing with Wendy, [[Isla]], and Theresa. She rants about the science fair and claims to ""know how it feels"" to be a slave. Theresa gets annoyed so Heidi makes fun of her ""tiny home"", calling her house a ""trailer"" and her block a ""trailer park"". Wendy tells Theresa to ignore Heidi, resulting in Heidi saying she'd try, but Theresa is ""such a bitch"". Isla gets upset and Heidi mocks her, only for Cartman to walk up to her and ask what is up. Heidi deflates and acts annoyed when he comes over, similar to how he reacted to her earlier in the season. Heidi and Cartman walk down the hallway to talk with Butters about judging the school science fair. Butters says he cannot because he was going to [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s birthday. Kyle says ""some of their projects are pretty cool"", resulting in Heidi and Cartman yelling ""shut up Kyle!"" at the same time. Then, they say ""samesies!"" and kiss each other. After she says that the science fair is not going to ""contribute to society"", Jerry Jones arrives in a helicopter and talks with [[PC Principal]] about the science fair. During recess, Heidi walks around Cartman, upset that the Special Ed kids are getting ""all the support"". Heidi then speaks at the podium for a school assembly about the school administration overfunding special education students, saying that everyone could end up as poor as Theresa. After arguing with Cartman about his support, Heidi says that if the school administration does not cancel the Special Ed Science Fair, she will have them all fired. This results in Mr. Mackey telling PC Principal ""she's kind of like Cartman, but with the ability to follow through."" Heidi then gets PC Principal and Mr. Mackey to talk with Jerry Jones about cancelling the Special Ed Science Fair, but they hold everyone inside hostage. Heidi yells at Cartman for not being a supportive boyfriend and he calls her a bitch, resulting in her intimidating him into standing down, showing her newly acquired dominance in their relationship. Heidi steals the [[Water Bears]] and runs through the school, attempting to escape with them. When she is cornered, she drinks the water bears so she does not have to judge the fair. Later, she and Cartman watch TV at his house, where he is surprised that she drank the water bears. She demands he snuggles with her, to which Cartman reluctantly complies.

""[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"" shows how both Heidi and Cartman enjoy being terrible together, antagonizing Kyle many times throughout the episode. She and Cartman physically fight in the school hallway over their plans for the evening, so Kyle breaks up the fight and tries to convince everyone that they have all been being mean to each other for too long, resulting in Heidi comparing him to his mother. Later that night, Heidi and Cartman go to Stan's house to watch the new Terrance and Phillip show. Upon seeing Kyle, she calls him his mother, surprising Kyle. When Kyle says that he feels bad for the person being farted on, Heidi says ""Kyle's mom doesn't like the cartoon, guys. Better shut it off"", resulting in everyone laughing at Kyle. Cartman and Heidi use the PA system to tell ""Mrs. Broflovski"" that ""her"" tampons are at the front desk, angering Kyle. The combination of Heidi and Cartman's actions inadvertently lead to Canada being nuked.

[[File:SPST - 00093.png|left|thumb|Heidi recognizes the victim mentality she has created in her relationship with Cartman.]]
Heidi and Cartman's relationship ends at the end of ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"". Tweek, Craig, Kyle, and Stan talk about seeing President Garrison, Heidi and Cartman join them. When the group decides to help Kyle look for Ike, Heidi gets mad with Cartman because it is supposed to be their date night. When Kyle says that he does not need anyone to come with him, she accuses Kyle of not wanting her around because he had “the hots” for her, but Kyle says that he would “never have the hots” for the person she is now, leaving her hurt. She walks with the group until they make it to the bridge where she threw her phone, reflecting on how different she was when she decided to throw her phone. She gets angry with Cartman when he tries to tell her to keep going, reminding him the bridge is where their whole relationship started. When group then makes it to the cabin, Heidi remembers that Cartman brought her there, telling her how his friends destroyed his electronics. She also remembers when they used to talk in the park for hours, asking why they would not do so anymore. When Cartman gets annoyed, she mentions how he used to be nice to her, resulting in him saying the same thing to her. She tells him she tried, but he always rolled his eyes at her, resulting in him doing just that. After Kyle finds Ike's toy binoculars, she realizes that they are in the same place Cartman took her on Halloween. She realized that Cartman tried getting her killed, yelling at her imaginary past-self. After Mr. Garrison is captured and brought to the Community Center, Heidi steals Bob White's pistol. She holds Cartman at gunpoint, blaming him for the person she has become, but realizes that she has been participating in self-victimization and breaks up with him for the last time. Cartman takes the gun and tries to threaten suicide, but Heidi sees through his trick, knowing his manipulative tactics, so as a result, the suicide attempt failed.

Heidi has committed the following crimes during the series:
She has had four voice actors throughout the series. Heidi is currently voiced by Jessica Mackinson, who has been voicing her since 2005. She was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', which was her first speaking role. From 2000 to 2001, she was voiced by [[Mona Marshall]]. [[Eliza J. Schneider]] voiced her from 2001 to 2005. In older seasons, her voice is similar to [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s voice.

Heidi has light, ash-brown hair. Since ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", she wears a lime green jacket with a red collar, black trousers, and red gloves. In her initial appearance in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"", she had black hair (though it was shown as its later brown shade in various shots) and wore an orange sweater when she was not in her choir uniform. She was also depicted with her former appearance in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', with her black hair and orange sweater. [[Wendy Testaburger]] also mentions in ""[[The Hobbit]]"" that ""Heidi Turners butt is flat!"" 

When she was dressed like a whore in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", she wore a white tied crop-top and matching skirt, very similar to [[Sally Turner|Sally]]'s. When dressed for bed, she wears lavender plaid pajamas with a pink collar and pockets, as seen in ""[[Marjorine]]"".

She looks similar to [[Linda Triscotti]] and [[Karen McCormick]], who both wear the same clothes as Heidi. The only differences are their hairstyles, Heidi's lack of a hairclip, and differently colored hair.

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", she gains a red hat with pink, white, and purple accents; a purple blossom is also attached to it.

Heidi starts to gain weight in ""[[Doubling Down]]"", following her discovery of ""Beyond KFC"". Her weight increases in ""[[Moss Piglets]]"", where she ends up being almost as fat as her boyfriend, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. She also appears to have developed facial acne while fat, with pimple clusters on her left cheek and above her right eye.

In ""[[The Problem with a Poo]]"", she had lost all the weight and facial acne looking like her normal self again, though she is still shown wearing her hat. In ""[[Board Girls]]"", she is no longer seen wearing her hat when the girls celebrate Heather Swanson's defeat. In ""[[Bike Parade]]"", Heidi can be seen riding in the bike parade wearing her hat with a flower pinned to it. However, in ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"" (with a pink mask), she is seen wearing her hat again.

Heidi is often sweet and socially friendly, although in earlier seasons she proved to sometimes be unkind to the point of cruelty. In ""[[Marjorine]]"", she initially displayed a dislike of the 'new girl' [[Marjorine (Character)|Marjorine]], openly mocking her, despite later comforting her and offering her a makeover as an apology for their teasing. She is a ""popular girl"" among the 4th graders, and she was shown participating in the girls' meeting in ""[[The List]]"", discussing which girl's purse was the cutest. Since the major developmental growth of her character, and her promotion to a significant character in recent seasons, Heidi is always portrayed as a genial, thoughtful, cute, and sweet girl. Since [[Season Twenty]], she has been shown to be one of the nicest and most socially sensitive girls in [[South Park Elementary|South Park]], quitting social media after being horrendously bullied by a [[Skankhunt42|troll]].

In ""[[Sons A Witches]]"", it is shown that Heidi cares a lot about her appearance, and as a result, it takes her longer than usual to get ready for special events. According to Cartman, she has ""no time management skills, whatsoever.""

A negative attribute to her personality is that she is very prideful. This is the reason why she is willing to tolerate Cartman's abuse, as it was revealed in ""[[Doubling Down]]"" that she refuses to admit to her friends she made a bad decision by hooking up with Cartman, and when she does break up with him, her friends mock her for ever dating him in the first place. This resulted in her getting back together with Cartman and allowing him to manipulate her emotions. In the following episode, ""[[Moss Piglets]]"", Heidi became menacing, wicked, and dejected.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] finale episode, ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"", Heidi hits her breaking point and was prepared to kill Cartman, blaming him for her negative personality change. She would soon come to realize that Cartman was not the one who caused it but her own victim mentality. She decides to abandon the victim mentality and break up with Cartman.

As she appeared as her old self prior to her weight gain in ""[[The Problem with a Poo]]"", it can be assumed that she has also reclaimed her kind and caring personality as well.

[[File:Heidi and her parents.png|thumb|Heidi hugs her parents before leaving in ""[[Sons A Witches]]"".]]
Heidi and her parents were first seen in the story arc ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"" and ""[[Probably]]"". When [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] founded his church and the parents were trying to convince their kids to come back, Heidi went inside. Her dad told her to come back, but then a beam from the roof of Cartman's poorly made church landed on him, killing him after she stated she did not want to go to Hell. Although her father was dead, he was later shown alive in ""[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]"", telling his wife that he regrets cheating on her with another woman. She has a different set of parents in ""[[Marjorine]]"". Further, in ""[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]"" she was shown yet again with a different set of parents and [[Boy with Blond Hair|a possible sibling]]. Her latest, again different, parents were shown at the end of ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", and in ""[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]"". All of these are likely continuity errors.

[[File:HeidiCry.png|thumb|right|Heidi crying next to Robby.]]
After [[Timmy]] sends [[Gobbles]] away during ""[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]"", Heidi is seen crying and screaming, ""No, [[Robby]]! No!"" over a dog's body, that appears to have been run over by a car. It is likely that Robby was her pet.

[[File:DoucheAndADanish00015.png|thumb|Heidi and Eric holding hands.]]
Their relationship goes all the way back to [[Season Four]]'s ""[[Probably]]"", where her parents arrived to pick her up from Cartman's church. Cartman convinced them to let her stay, for selfish reasons, so she can be ""saved"". Here, she was named ""Marcy"".

They were paired together in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"". Heidi was displeased when she was paired with him. Cartman, however, did show remorse for breaking the egg and asked [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] to let her pass and have him fail. However, this was done for a selfish reason, as Cartman figured an A and an F would average out to a C-. Since that episode, Heidi and Cartman did not interact with each other, until in ""[[Stunning and Brave]]"". In that episode, Cartman calls Heidi ‘clitty litter’, which may suggest that even Heidi does not get along with him.

However, Heidi and Cartman developed a relationship starting in ""[[The Damned]]"", where she goes on to show Cartman a life outside of social media. In ""[[Wieners Out]]"", the two are confirmed to be a couple, and in a ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"", they surprised their classmates by kissing. The couple worked together to help Denmark get [[TrollTrace.com]] up and running. They even sing a song named [[Let's Come Together As a School]] with each other when the children were making danishes for the fundraiser.

In ""[[Fort Collins]]"", Cartman is unable to tell Heidi about his bigotry in the past and lies to her about an incident with Jimmy. Their relationship becomes strained in ""[[Not Funny]]"" when Heidi is focusing all her attention on solving the rocket problem. However, at the end of [[Season Twenty]], Heidi and Cartman are still together.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] premiere episode, ""[[White People Renovating Houses]]"", their relationship becomes strained. Cartman begins to be annoyed with Heidi for not being submissive to him. He blames her for his unhappiness in their relationship, accusing her of being mentally abusive. Heidi grows confused, and cries, as she cannot figure out why Cartman has been acting so indifferent towards her. At the end of the episode, Cartman breaks up with Heidi and leaves her heartbroken.

In the following episode, ""[[Put It Down]]"", Cartman leaves Heidi a voicemail, threatening her that he will commit suicide if she does not take him back. Worried about him, Heidi accepts this, and they get back together.

The toxicity of their relationship plays a large role in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, ""[[Sons A Witches]]"". In the episode, Cartman grows frustrated with Heidi for taking so long to get ready when they planned to go to the pumpkin patch together. Instead of telling her how he felt, he attempts to spare her feelings and therefore any guilt he'd feel for telling her by irrationally attempting to get rid of her. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] reprimands Cartman for this, saying that “Heidi is a nice girl”, and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her, adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly. Cartman dismisses this, and later he convinces Heidi to dress up as Gretel while dressing himself up as Hansel. Immediately after he takes Heidi into the woods with him at night, and ultimately ditches her in the woods to die, and gets her kidnapped by a witch.

It was revealed in the episode, ""[[Doubling Down]]"", that Heidi tolerates Cartman's abuse towards her because she does not want to admit she made a mistake when she became his girlfriend. These feelings are directly influenced by the other girls, who laugh at her and tease her for ever dating him, albeit playfully. They also expressed concern for Heidi's sanity, and her safety while in her relationship with Cartman, all holding a personal vendetta against him. Kyle addresses this and politely asks the girls to cease their teasing because it is making her feel insecure about herself. The girls assume that Kyle has feelings for Heidi, leading Kyle to question his relationship with her, and he soon develops an interest in her. After breaking up with Cartman the girls take Heidi out for dinner at Buca De Faggoncini, where they again chastise Heidi repeatedly for dating Cartman (all except Lola, who notes that Heidi already admitted she made a mistake). It soon comes to light that Heidi has become Kyle's girlfriend, angering Cartman. Cartman recognizes Heidi's confusion about what she wants and uses this to manipulate Heidi into taking him back while making her unintentionally prejudiced against Jews.

In the episode, ""[[Moss Piglets]]"", we see the result of the toxicity of Cartman and Heidi's relationship. Heidi begins to inherit several of Cartman's traits including his obesity, accent, and attitude, but even lazier, louder, and more obnoxious than he is. Heidi had now become practically a female version of Cartman, turning into an emotionally damaged bully with really aggressive tendencies, so much to the point that Cartman himself is at times intimidated by her. Despite Cartman being clearly unhappy with what he turned Heidi into, he was desperate to keep Heidi all to himself no matter how demeaning and selfish Heidi became since he will be lonely all over again without her. Cartman and Heidi switched attitudes in their relationship, and Heidi grew irritated with Cartman, while Cartman became more compassionate, acting much nicer to her. Eventually, Cartman has enough of Heidi's antics and begs her to go back to being the sweet girl she once was, only for Heidi to refuse.

In ""[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"", Eric and Heidi enjoy being awful together, getting into a fistfight, and watching the premiere of [[Terrance and Phillip]] on ''Netflix''. This parallels their early relationship from [[Season Twenty]] and proves that their dynamic is healthiest when they were both either at their best or at their worst.

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] finale episode, ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"", Heidi battles with her inner conscience over her relationship with Eric. While walking with the boys through the forest, they pass landmarks from the previous season, including the bridge Heidi threw her phone into when she quit social media. She recounts and reassesses the events that lead her to meet Eric Cartman, and what made her fall for him. She later recognized the place where she was kidnapped by the witch from Halloween and Cartman had her dress up as Gretel realizing Cartman tried to have her killed. She then held Cartman at gunpoint blaming him for the person she became, but soon realized she has been engaging in self-victimization ever since she has been seeing Cartman. She decides to abandon the victim mentality and break up with Cartman. Cartman tries to get Heidi to take him back by threatening suicide but the attempt failed as Heidi is now fully aware of Cartman's manipulative nature and simply leaves him.

The two have not had any onscreen interactions since then, but it can be assumed that they are currently on bad terms since their final break-up. Heidi is shown sitting far from Cartman in her two appearances in ""[[The Problem with a Poo]]"" implying that she is intentionally trying to avoid him. In ""[[Basic Cable]]"", [[Scott Malkinson]] asks Cartman for love advice mentioning how he and Heidi were together a long time and Cartman tells Scott that girls and relationships are ""diabetes times ten"" showing that Cartman is still bitter about the break-up.  

Heidi  appears in Cartman's dream in ""[[Pajama Day]]"", suggesting that he still thinks about her.

[[File:SPDD - 00099.png|thumb|Heidi and Kyle in ""[[Doubling Down]]"".]]
Kyle first becomes concerned for Heidi in ""[[Sons A Witches]]"", when Cartman devises plans to kill her off right in front of him. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] reprimands Cartman for this, saying that ""Heidi is a nice girl"", and tells him that he should just break up with her instead of creating horrible schemes to get rid of her, adding that she did not deserve to be treated so badly.

They briefly dated in the episode, ""[[Doubling Down]]"", after Kyle convinced Heidi to break up with Cartman, and they develop mutual feelings for each other. However Heidi breaks up with Kyle, inadvertently calling him a ""dirty Jew"", shocking him. She walks away with Cartman, who manipulated her into taking him back.

In ""[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"", Heidi teases Kyle by comparing him to his mother. 

In ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"", Heidi accuses Kyle of not wanting her around because he had a crush on her and she rejected him. In response, Kyle says he'd never be interested in who she is now, leaving her hurt. This implies that she felt remorseful for how horrible she had become, thanks to Cartman's manipulative influence on her. 

In ""[[The Problem with a Poo]]"", Heidi returns to her old self and sits behind Kyle in the music room with the two showing no hostility, implying that they are now on amicable terms. However, it is unclear if they still have feelings for each other or not as they have not interacted with each other since then.

[[File:Sp-2002-news-episode-announcement.jpg|thumb|203x203px|Bebe and another girl cry about Heidi quitting Twitter.]]
Bebe appears to be very close to Heidi, possibly best friends. They usually are seen talking together and eating lunch with each other on multiple occasions.

In ""[[Marjorine]]"", Bebe and the popular girls were invited to Heidi's sleepover.

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", Bebe and another girl can be seen crying in the hallway after Heidi quits Twitter. Later, Bebe breaks down and starts crying while [[Mr. Mackey]] holds a memorial service for Heidi on [[Twitter]].

In ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"", Bebe is so shocked to see that Heidi is in a relationship with Cartman that she vomits.

In ""[[Marjorine]]"", she was angry that Marjorine, who was Butters in disguise, was coming to her sleepover. Heidi was the one that insulted Marjorine in the first place, although after seeing how much she had upset ""her"", she felt guilty and tried to cheer ""her"" up.

In ""[[Members Only]]"", Butters appears to get along with Heidi very well after he starts copying Cartman's behavior around her, much to Cartman's annoyance.

In ""[[Moss Piglets]]"", she tries to burden Butters into taking her role in judging the Special Ed Science Fair, despite Clyde stating that he invited Butters to his birthday party.

Her earliest appearance in the show was in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"", as part of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir, though her first appearance as a South Park resident was in the background in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", watching their fight and in Home Economics.

[[File:DoublingDownGirls.JPG|thumb|The girls take Heidi to dinner at Buca De Faggoncini.]]
Heidi seems to be in good relations with all members of the popular girls' clique. She is often paired up with one of the other girls either talking with them in the background or playing with them in the schoolyard, mainly [[Esther]]. She is usually eating with them during lunch time. When she hosted a slumber party at her house, she invited nearly all the girls in her clique.

In ""[[The List]]"", Heidi is a member of the girls' [[Pleases and Sparkles Club]].

In ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"", the girls are all shocked to see that Heidi is in a relationship with Cartman, [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] faints and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] vomits.

In the episode, ""[[Doubling Down]]"", Kyle discovers that Heidi tolerates Cartman's abuse towards her because she does not want to admit she made a mistake when she became his girlfriend. These feelings are later revealed to be directly influenced by the girls, who laugh at her and tease her for dating him, albeit playfully. Not intentionally trying to hurt her feelings. They also express concern for Heidi's sanity, and her safety while in her relationship with Cartman, all holding a personal vendetta against him. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] addresses this and politely asks the girls to cease their teasing because it is making her feel insecure about herself. The girls assume that Kyle has feelings for Heidi, leading Kyle to question his relationship with her, and he soon develops an interest in her. They later all treat her and take her out for lunch, trying to make her feel better which ultimately falls apart when Cartman is mentioned. All the girls rip on him, resulting in Heidi going back to Cartman and ""doubling down"".

In the episode, ""[[Moss Piglets]]"", the girls notice how Heidi has changed, and express their concern for her as they watch her evolve into an entirely different person. Heidi's relationship with Cartman caused her to become deeply and emotionally deterred. Her attitude changed and all throughout the episode she acts savagely toward the girls, ripping into them, and teasing them. This is obviously meant to parallel Cartman's treatment of the boys, except with clearer roots.

In the episode ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"", she returns to them after she breaks up with Cartman.

In the episode, ""[[The Problem with a Poo]]"", she appears to be back on good terms with the girls as she is shown sitting with them during a school assembly.

In the episode ""[[Board Girls]]"", she is seen celebrating [[Heather Swanson]]'s defeat with the other members of the Board Girls Gaming Club.

She also appears with them in ""[[Pajama Day]]"" running down the hallways with them.

Heidi Turner appears in the girls' secret base, The [[Pleases and Sparkles Club]]. After ""[[Pose as Bebe's Boyfriend]]"", it is revealed that she did not make the Facebook post mentioning that the [[New Kid]] is Bebe's boyfriend, so the girls suspect she is the ""two-faced bitch"". During ""[[Unplanned Parenthood]]"" the New Kid takes a picture of the abortion records and takes them back to get girls. The New Kid heads to [[Canada]] in ""[[Heading North]]"" and then finds the [[Minister of Montreal]] at the end of ""[[O Canada (Quest)|O Canada]]"". Heidi is revealed to be the two-faced bitch when the translated abortion records reveal that [[Nancy Turner|her mother]] had been to the abortion clinic. However, the girls soon forgive her since she said she was really sorry. She can then comment that the New Kid should stay as a girl, since it would be ""so much better"". During ""[[Beat Up Clyde]]"", Heidi and the rest of the New Kid's allies storm [[Clyde's Fortress|Clyde's fortress]]. Inside the fortress, Heidi is fighting Clyde's troops with the other factions the New Kid brought in the attack.

Heidi messages the New Kid after they get the Indian Tunic, suggesting that they try it on. She teaches the New Kid how to change their clothes and how to change the coloring of their clothes.

Henrietta Biggle,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Henrietta_Biggle,,"is a 4th grader who first appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, ""[[Raisins]]"". She is the main female member of the [[Goth Kids]] and was the first goth to have their name revealed. She speaks with a soft Valley Girl accent.

[[Henrietta's Bedroom]] is one of the Goth Kids' main hang-out spots and remains the only bedroom of the Goth Kids to be seen in the show.

In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", she, along with the other Goth Kids, sets fire to the South Park [[Hot Topic]] store, burning it to the ground.
*'''Attempted Murder / Kidnapping:''' In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", she, with the Goth Kids, kidnap [[Mike Makowski]] with the intent of murdering him.
*'''Drug Abuse / Underage Smoking:''' The Goth Kids are frequently seen smoking cigarettes despite their age (5 to 10), in addition to abusing cough syrup to hallucinate.
*'''Motor vehicle theft / Driving Without A License:''' In ""[[The Ungroundable]]"", she drives [[Harriet Biggle|her mother]]'s car without her permission, even though she is too young to have a license.
*'''Treason / Sedition:''' In the [[:Category:Superheroes Saga|Superhero Saga]], the Goth Kids are shown to be part of the [[Cult of Cthulhu]], supporting [[Cthulhu]]'s reign of terror.

It is revealed in ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"" that [[Bradley Biggle]] is her brother, though not by blood because as the story progresses we learn that he is actually an alien. During the events of ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"", Henrietta's parents send her to a [[Troubled Acres|camp]] attempting to improve her attitude.

Henrietta has engaged in numerous criminal offenses, mainly along with the other Goth Kids.

She plays the keyboard in the Goth Kids' band. Their only known song is ""[[Talent Shows are for Fags]]"" played ironically at the [[South Park Elementary Talent Show]] in the episode ""[[Erection Day]]"".

She can also drive well, as seen in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"" when she steals [[Harriet Biggle|her mother]]'s car.

[[File:GothKids3DawnofthePosers014.png|thumb|Henrietta as an ""Emo""]]
Henrietta is overweight and has medium-length, spiky straight hair that is parted in the center. She has a slanted posture, to hide her stomach. She wears mascara on her eyelashes, round loops on the sides of her eyes, purple lipstick, and black pointed nails. She wears a black dress with a sheer illusion neckline and bat wing-like edges, a necklace with the cross on it, black finger-less gloves, black socks, and black Mary-Janes. She does not wear eyeliner, unlike the other goth kids. Oftentimes, she holds a cigarette holder whenever she wants to smoke. 

When the vampire trend slowly grows, she dressed up as a conformist to not confuse others with them being vampires. She wears a plain pink, buttoned-up uniform and light-grey shorts.

When a camp turned her ""emo"", she wore her hair parted on the side, grew her bangs longer, and dyed the ends of her hair pink, sporting a green headband as well. She wore running black mascara, pink lipstick, pink striped gloves, and a bat on her necklace instead of a cross. 

In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', during the quest [[Attack the School]], a bronze helmet with tiny wings on its sides, a bronze breastplate, and a red cape are added to her regular outfit.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Henrietta appears as an adult woman. She is still the most overweight of the goth kids and still has her cross necklace. However, instead of wearing her typical black dress, Henrietta sports a striped purple and pink shirt, black pants, and her hair has been dyed completely blue.

In ""[[Pajama Day]]"", she is seen wearing a red and black robe with red bat decor and an eye mask of a purple bat.

Henrietta hates her mother, often being over-dramatic and claiming she is abused even though her mother is kind and generous, offering her and her friends cookies (except once when she called Henrietta a ""fatty""). Harriet seems to be unaware that Henrietta hates her.

Henrietta is also shown to had a bad relationship with her father. His only appearance is in ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"" where he is shown to be somewhat stricter than his wife.

Henrietta finds her little brother annoying and Bradley, in return, is scared of her. Despite relying on her to keep him company, Bradley would like to gain the upper hand on his sister, which he eventually does in ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", where he mimicked her after discovering his powers. He returned to their home only to call her fat and flip her off, suggesting an utter dislike for her.

Henrietta is always seen inside her own bedroom of her house, also hanging out alongside the Goth Kids boys. A selfie can be taken with her after completing the quest to initiate a black magic spell sourced online by Michael. Apart from that, she plays no further role in the storyline until ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]''.

In ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'' Henrietta plays a more significant role, joining up with [[The New Kid]] to take down the [[South Park Vampire Society|Vampire Kids]] at the [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]] eatery, where she is seen having a meal with her parents; she will be unlocked as a Combat Buddy in the process, also she will be included as a party member for the main storyline in past and future save games. If Henrietta, despite not showing up in the main game cut scenes, is picked anytime for combat, she will have a dialogue based on the events where the battles occur. This also alludes to character banter between other superheroes rather than just [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] and [[Mysterion]]. However, while she does comment on other characters, only [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]], [[Mysterion]], and [[Mintberry Crunch]] will directly talk to her and make comments about her abilities.

Henrietta is a ranged combat buddy, having abilities that cover a wide range. She acts as a great party backer, as her abilities provide advantageous buffs to party members or even herself.

Henrietta's Satanic Seal ability is one of the best support abilities around, as it gives an attack boost, provides protection, and removing any status effects to a targeted member or even herself, providing a massive edge in combat. Her Baleful Blessing ability also provides great support, providing heal to a targeted member or even herself, and a lifesteal attack for further healing if any enemies are within range.

Henrietta's Ultimate Ability, Black Mass can be considered one of the most devastating Ultimate abilities among all the party members that can be picked; it is a lifesteal attack that applies damage to all enemies on the battlefield while healing all allies in the process.

The downside to her is that she has one of the lowest health bars of any ally, so she is far more likely to be picked off by powerful enemies such as [[Morgan Freeman]] fairly quickly. And in trade for her buffing abilities, she lacks the ability to do much damage as two of her abilities do not deal any direct damage at all.

Appears as a neutral card in-game along with the other Goth Kids.

[[File:1012 pillow-talk.jpg|thumb|left|Ms. Garrison and her first love after her sex-change operation.]]
Herbert Garrison grew up in Arkansas, where most of his problems originated. Even at a young age, Garrison showed signs of homosexuality, when he felt unloved by his father when he would not molest him. Garrison knew about many cases of child molestation and saw it as a form of love, not a disturbing crime. Garrison received a degree of mechanical engineering in college. It is unsure when, but instead of becoming an engineer like he was qualified to be, Garrison became the third-grade teacher at [[South Park Elementary]], despite his lack of knowledge of his subjects. Despite being a homosexual, he would react in negativity or ""go nuts"" if anyone would ask him if he was gay, once using the excuse of ""acting like it to get chicks."" He was caught trying to molest a boy, [[Eric Cartman]], who was looking to find an older and more mature person to hang out with. After Garrison was released from prison, he was fired from his job for what he tried to do and decided to pursue a career in writing romance novels. He published one novel, which unfortunately for him won an award in Best Homo-erotic Novel, despite the novel’s main audience was women. This let him to having a severe breakdown causing him to leave to the mountains to live in solitude. When [[Ms. Choksondik]] comes to see him in the mountain for advice on how to handle his class, he realized that he must admit his sexuality and gets a different job at South Park Elementary, teaching the [[Kindergartners|Kindergarten class]].

After [[Ms. Choksondik]]'s death, Garrison was promoted as the Fourth Grade teacher and was reunited with his old class. He had started a new relationship with a man called [[Mr. Slave]], who in the episode ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"" was used by Garrison to try and get himself fired for being gay, so that he could sue the school for millions of dollars. This did not work and The Boys ended up getting sent to tolerance camp. [[The Boys]] were released from the camp due to his behavior at the Tolerance Museum and unfortunately for Mr. Garrison, he got sent to the camp himself, along with Mr. Slave, deemed intolerant of their own homosexuality. In ""[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]"", he got a sex change operation, realizing he was not gay, but just a woman stuck in a man's body and changed her name to Janet. This led to the break up of her and Mr. Slave, who said he liked having sex with men, not women. It was at this point that Mrs. Garrison became homophobic once more and returned to her original beliefs on homosexuals. Ms. Garrison was very promiscuous with her sexuality, claiming to have let truckers 'do' her in their trucks.

[[File:600px-Music Cover.jpg|right|thumb|As ""Janet Garrison"".]]
After she learned she could not have periods or get pregnant, Ms. Garrison decided she was not actually a woman, but it was too late to have the operation undone, and she accepted what she was. When Ms. Garrison learned that Mr. Slave was going to marry [[Big Gay Al]], she tried to stop the governor from passing the law for gay marriage, by having two of her male students ([[Stan Marsh|Stan]] & [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]) take care of an egg. She expected the two to break the egg, thus proving gay couples were irresponsible and could not take care of a child. The egg, though, was still intact by the end of the project, letting gay couples marry. Ms. Garrison was morally opposed to teaching evolution in ""[[Go God Go]]"" and was replaced by [[Richard Dawkins]] as the teacher. After initially fighting one another, the two form a relationship and Richard Dawkins convinces Ms. Garrison to give up Christianity and become an atheist like him. Dawkin's views on atheism and Ms. Garrison's 'assertion' combined would apparently lead to the world becoming atheists. Their relationship ends, though, when [[Eric Cartman]] reveals that Ms. Garrison used to be a man.

Ms. Garrison explored her sexuality some more after mistakenly going into a [[Les Bos|Lesbian Bar]] and ending up having sex with a woman named [[Allison]]. She took to her new sexuality quickly, defending Lesbian rights and Les Bos, the bar where she became gay again. Yet in ""[[Eek, A Penis!]]"", after watching the famous show of [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] about Thomas Beatie, she realizes that the sex change operation was a big mistake. She pays to have her penis re-grown using her DNA and became a man once more. It is unknown if he is once more homosexual after his sexual encounter with women. In the episode ""[[The Cissy]]"", where Cartman requests to use the girl's washroom because he claims he is transgender or as Cartman says ""transginger"", Mr. Garrison advises [[Principal Victoria]] to give in to avoid the scandal Cartman is almost certain to cause otherwise, speaking from experience as he was once transgender himself.

In ""[[Where My Country Gone?]]"", he starts to speak out against the undocumented immigrants ([[Canada|Canadians]]) in the country, which results in him being fired from [[South Park Elementary]]. He then starts a movement to ""fuck 'em all to death"" and to build a wall separating the countries; only to find that the [[Canadian President]] has already built a wall to keep out the Americans. He sneaks into Canada, and literally fucks the Canadian president to death, which results in mass reverse-immigrations. He later bids in the Presidential Elections. In ""[[Sponsored Content]]"" at the Debate, he suggests fucking all the Syrian Refugees to death, believing they are all [[ISIS]] soldiers. It also seems that he has a lot more supporters than [[Hillary Clinton]]. He also returns to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] with Principal Victoria and [[Caitlyn Jenner]] to stop the town's fate of ending.

[[File:Sp-2006-press-art-image-01-garrison-memberberries.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Garrison attempting to destroy the member berry to lose the election.]] 
In [[Season Twenty]] Garrison is still running for President, but after realizing he could win and does not have any plans to do in his presidency, he tries to foil the election in order to lose his supporters by trying to sit down the national anthem during a football game, however he fails since the rebooted version of the national anthem allows people to sit, stand, or kneel. He again tries to foil the election by making derogatory remarks against women and the TSA during a campaign rally. Instead of losing supporters, he instead gets chased by an angry mob demanding answers. When he finds out that the reason of why he was gaining more supporters was because of the memberberries, he tries to destroy them with [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] but to no avail. However, having consumed a memberberry himself, he goes on his campaign and wins the election.

In [[Season Twenty-One]], though stating how he can handle societal psychology, despite being informed, his approval ratings are very low as depicted in the episode ""[[Doubling Down]]"", a desperate Garrison ends up running back to South Park after launching a nuke at Toronto that killed a million Canadians at the end of ""[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"". During the events of ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"", he starts appearing all over South Park scaring people by asking about his approval ratings. Eventually, he is found and captured, but manages to escape while everyone is looking away.

In [[Season Twenty-Two]], he makes a brief cameo at the end of the season finale ""[[Bike Parade]]"", enjoying the town's newfound sense of tegridy, but has handcuffs on implying that he was recaptured.

However, in [[Season Twenty-Three]], he is seen back in office by ""[[Season Finale]]"" where Randy Marsh calls for help to get out of jail after Randy's crimes in the episode ""[[Mexican Joker]]"". Garrison suggests the DARVO technique: Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and, Offender. They role-play the tactic, which seems to work for Randy. Garrison ends the phone call by telling him that he'll take care of the problem.

In ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"", set during the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, Garrison reveals to Stan that he is choosing to ""actively not do anything"" about the pandemic, as it is helping his campaign promise to get rid of all the Mexicans (when Stan objects that the pandemic isn’t killing only Mexicans, Garrison responds that it's killing ""a whole lot of 'em"". He later appears at the end of the episode where he uses a flamethrower to burn a [[Chief Scientist|scientist]] along with the  [[pangolin]] to prevent the [[COVID-19 Vaccine|COVID-19 vaccine]] from being created and spoiling his anti-Mexican agenda, before then asking people to vote for him in the upcoming election.

In ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", Garrison becomes a fourth-grade teacher again after he is shown to have lost the election, and he returns to South Park along with a man sidekick named [[Mr. Service]]. He acts oblivious to his tenure as president and attempts to continue on with his normal life. He uses the [[Hollywood Elites]] to warp reality and turn Mr. Service into Mr. Hat, and manages to return to being the teacher for the 4th grade students.

As 3rd and 4th grade teacher, Mr. Garrison teaches a rather incompetent class. The students in his classroom never pay attention and instead chat with each other while he is giving a lesson. While the children do occasionally receive punishment for slacking off, such as Stan having to read an embarrassing note that Bebe passed up to him in front of the whole class in ""[[Clubhouses]]"", they never learn from their mistakes and usually repeated the behavior.

Mr. Garrison is also noted for his class showing no concern for his well-being. In ""[[Gnomes]]"", when he announces that the school is considering firing him on grounds that he does not teach his class about current events, the students have no problem with it. Additionally, in ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", Kyle even tells the [[Ms. Ellen|substitute teacher]] that they have no respect for Garrison when she tells the kids to treat her the same way they treat him.

Despite this, however, Stan, Kyle, and Wendy go out of their way to visit him at the mental home and tell him that they hope he is able to come back to school soon and teach again in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"".

Garrison wears dark green pants, a green jacket, and black shoes. He also wears black-framed eyeglasses. He is mostly bald, with gray hair on the sides.

As a woman, she tailored his jacket into a tank-top, wore lipstick and gold earrings (similar to [[Mrs. Testaburger]]'s) as well as shorter pants and new white shoes. Her hair remained the same, however, bald spot and all.

After becoming male again in ""[[Eek, A Penis!]]"", Garrison wears an outfit identical to the original one, with the only exception being a belt added to the pants and a very minor change to his collar. Mr. Garrison is also left-handed. His hair was brown as seen in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", but in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"" as a kid his hair is grey, but he may have dyed it for the party in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", though. Ms. Garrison is highly renowned in the future as the symbol of Atheism, but this was prevented from happening by Cartman in [[Go God Go XII]].

In [[Season Twenty]], Mr. Garrison's appearance changed to include an artificial tan, and a hairstyle resembling that of [[Donald Trump]], since he substitutes Trump for the Republican candidate for the presidential election. As President of the United States, Garrison wore a dark-blue suit with a red tie and white shirt. In ""[[Put It Down]]"", he is shown to no longer wear his glasses in his Twitter picture, though he wears them again in ""[[Sons A Witches]]"", suggesting he only takes them off for pictures.

After losing the election and returning to South Park in ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", Garrison's appearance returns to its original state with a few changes. His design now includes a belt and a slightly altered shirt.

Herbert Garrison suffers from many psychological problems that are touched many times throughout the show, though it appears nothing is ever done about it. The most noticeable of his problems are multiple identity disorder, represented through various puppets. At the beginning of the series, while Mr. Garrison still taught Third Grade, he held a puppet on his hand known as [[Mr. Hat]]. Mr. Garrison used this puppet to show a second, more aggressive personality and to emote some of his most inner conflicts. One of these conflicts being the fact he was gay and his inability to come to terms with that. It was hinted many times that he was gay, but Mr. Garrison would take deep offense and insist he was straight. He would say Mr. Hat was gay and later admitted his second-hand puppet, [[Mr. Twig]], was also gay. Mr. Garrison denied the fact he was gay so much, that he even appeared homophobic and believed gay people were an abomination and were not human. In one particular episode, he tells Stan, ""Gay people are evil. Their hearts pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil.""

Garrison is very outspoken, often campaigning to have changes made that he feels are right or to block other people's ideals and can be considered heavily opinionated. During certain seasons and on occasion, he will slur the last part of a word in a sentence especially when he is saying something in emphasis.

Mr. Garrison is racist, first shown as a gag for ""Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo"", where he proposes the town gets rid of all the [[Mexico|Mexicans]] every Christmas, which he again suggests in ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", to which [[Mayor McDaniels|the Mayor]] angrily replies ""Mr. Garrison, every year you suggest that and every year we tell you NO!"" When rich black people were moving to South Park, he was able to gather the town's men into getting rid of them, under the pretense that the rich people were taking over the town. He got people to dress up like ""ghosts"" to scare them away and burned lower case T's on the black peoples' lawns standing for ""Time to Leave."" Once the town was rid of the rich people, [[File:614_image-12.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. Garrison and his lover, Mr. Slave]] Mr. Garrison said they could all get rich by selling the houses. This confused the town folk, who replied that they would then become what they did not want in the town. Mr. Garrison then exposed his true motive by saying ""Well, at least we got rid of those damn nig-"" (and the episode cuts to black and the credits roll). Mr. Garrison was also seen among a [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] group, but said he was not a member, but Mr. Hat was, again using his puppet to dispute the conflicts inside himself. Mr. Garrison appears to be on good terms with [[Chef]] though, a black man who works at the school and was even at his funeral.

Mr. Garrison is an incompetent teacher, who teaches his students useless things, such as why Chubby Checker left [[the Beatles]] and once spent a whole week of just showing his class old ''[[Buddy Ebsen|Barnaby Jones]]'' tapes. He has also taught his students a few times subjects far too advanced for them, like Joseph Stalin and communism. There have only been a few instances, mostly in more recent episodes, when Mr. Garrison has been portrayed as more competent as of a teacher taught a normal subject for a Fourth Grade class (many instances being after his sex change to a woman and back to a man), mostly Times Tables. Yet he goes about it by insulting the kids when they get an answer wrong, which is often. It is possible that Mr. Garrison teaches the students more about pop culture because he himself does not know a lot about the school curriculum, or just does not pay attention to it.

One of Mr. Garrison's common personality traits since giving up Mr. Hat is how his aggressive behavior now causes him to take things to the extremes. When he came out as gay, he began performing extremely vulgar homosexual acts with Mr. Slave. Of course, part of this was most likely because of the fact he wanted to get fired in order to sue the school. However, after becoming a woman, he became obsessed with declaring how much of a woman he was in the loudest and again most vulgar way. For example, he once shouted loudly to other women about how wonderful it was to have a period. Later, when Mrs. Garrison begins a brief relationship with Richard Dawkins, she gives up her religious faith due to the fact the Dawkins found her attractive and then became obnoxiously vocal about Atheism to the point of being fanatical. The same held true for when Mrs. Garrison decided to become a lesbian following a one-night stand with another woman. Following the encounter, Mrs. Garrison began to sexually harass all the women at the local lesbian bar and became obsessed with the idea of having random sex with women. These extreme shifts and stances of belief mixed with his already aggressive behavior make it to where Garrison is often verbally abusive to any and all who disagree with him. All of this suggests that he is an extreme narcissist.

Due to the fact that Mr. Garrison has had both male and female relationships during the course of the series, it is now unclear whether or not he can or should still be considered gay, but rather pansexual. Since Garrison's last relationship was lesbian in nature prior to returning to being a male, it has not been made clear what Garrison's current orientation is. It was once implied during earlier episodes that Garrison might have had sex with Cartman's pet pig '[[Fluffy]]', meaning he may also enjoy bestiality. In addition, ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"" also suggests that same idea when the people are watching the [[Jakovasaur]] and Garrison suggests that they let him keep the Jakovasaur. They replied that he once found a bird that he kept at [[Garrison Residence|his house]] to keep it alive, but he ended up having sex with it, to which Garrison replies that the bird was a total slut and then he tells everyone who did not have sex with the bird to raise their hands and everyone raises their hands (a reference to ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"").

Perhaps the most appropriate description of his orientation is in ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", when Chef states that there is a big difference between being gay and being Mr. Garrison, suggesting that he believes Mr. Garrison is a pervert. Mr. Garrison may also be a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]], as he was shown attempting to ""hook up"" with young boys in ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"".

Since returning to male gender in [[Season Twelve]], Mr. Garrison's behavior as of lad has been shown to be less eccentric than before, having been involved in no acts of deviant sexual behavior, outrageous outbursts, or psychotic episodes. Instead, he is behaved more or less like a responsible and sane teacher. The closest exceptions to this has been when he offered up his students as hostages in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"" and being afraid (along with all the other Republican members of South Park) that it was the end of the world after [[Barack Obama]] was elected president in ""[[About Last Night...]]"" he still did teach the curriculum ,however. One example of this is teaching them about Game of thrones in [[Cartman Finds Love]].

But his weird behavior returned in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, ""[[Where My Country Gone?]]"", he is fired from his teaching job after he verbally bashes South Park's many Canadian immigrants. He begins a political campaign to get rid of all the Canadians by ""fucking them all to death."" After traveling to Canada and doing this to the Canadian president, he decides to go to Washington, D.C. to run for President, with [[Caitlyn Jenner]] as his running mate possibly because they are both transgender.

Throughout the seasons, Mr. Garrison has had four teaching assistants. The first of these was [[Mr. Hat]]. It was through this puppet that Mr. Garrison channeled deep emotions through him he was afraid to show, like the fact he was gay. Mr. Garrison would use Mr. Hat to voice things he himself would never have said at the beginning of the show. Mr. Hat was gay and racist, according to Mr. Garrison, who he himself denied being. Mr. Hat was able to do things without the help of Mr. Garrison, which makes many people wonder if Mr. Hat does have a mind of his own. Some of those instances are when Mr. Hat drove a car through a prison wall to rescue Mr. Garrison and Chef and he has blinked and moved his eyes around a few times. Mr. Garrison had a debate with Mr. Hat about whether or not to go to a [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] meeting and when Mr. Garrison refused, Mr. Hat disappeared from the room. He has also shown he has had Mr. Hat since he was a young boy. [[File:Herbert Garrison.png|thumb|120px|Mr. Garrison with Mr. Hat]]

Mr. Garrison replaced Mr. Hat with a new hand puppet, [[Mr. Twig]]. Mr. Twig is a twig wearing the same shirt as Mr. Hat and spoke in the same voice until his final episode, where he spoke in a French accent (although since Mr. Twig's final speech to Mr. Garrison was romantic in nature, it may have been simply a joke). Mr. Garrison's students did not receive Mr. Twig well and wanted Mr. Hat back. Mr. Garrison insisted Mr. Hat would never be coming back. In the episode ""[[Chef Aid]]"", Mr. Twig kept on ending up in unfortunate accidents. Mr. Garrison soon discovered they were being caused by Mr. Hat, who wanted him to take him back. At the end of the episode, Mr. Twig helped Garrison realize that Mr. Hat was the best choice and Mr. Garrison discarded him and Mr. Twig has not been seen since.

In ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", Garrison learns that he can sue the education board for a lot of money if he is fired for being gay, and does his best to ensure this happens. He hires his then boyfriend [[Mr. Slave]] as his teaching assistant or ""teacher's ass"".  His classes become increasingly sexual and degenerate in nature, culminating in Mr. Garrison inserting the class gerbil, [[Lemmiwinks]], into Mr. Slave's rectum.

In the episode ""[[200]]"", Mr. Garrison is forced by [[Eric Cartman]] and his hand-turned-con-artist-puppet [[Mitch Conner]] to pull Mr. Hat out of storage, so as to reveal the truth about his father who until recently was believed to be Cartman's mother, [[Liane Cartman]]. Garrison is initially dismissive of using the old puppet, saying he no longer needed it. However, Mitch greets Mr. Hat, claiming they are old friends and war buddies and as the conversation between Mr. Garrison, Cartman, and Mitch progresses, Garrison seems to regress back to talk with and to Mr. Hat as if the puppet is alive.

In ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", Mr. Garrison is given a secret service agent, [[Mr. Service]] because he previously served as President of the United States. Towards the end of the episode, Mr. Service is digitally manipulated into Mr. Hat by the Hollywood Elites.

Mr. Garrison has committed numerous misdemeanors and felonies throughout the series.
Mr. Garrison has had both male and female relationships before, during, and after his sex -change, because of this it is unclear what his sexuality is, it is likely that he is bisexual.

Mr. Garrison starts dating Mr. Slave in ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", this relationship lasted until his sex change operation in ""[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]"". They had a falling out in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", where Mr. (at the time, Ms.) Garrison tried to sabotage Mr. Slave's and [[Big Gay Al]]'s wedding. Its hinted in ""[[Not Funny]]"" that Garrison might still have some feelings for Slave.

Richard Dawkins was Ms. Garrison's first boyfriend since the sex-change operation. This relationship was formed in ""[[Go God Go]]"" when Richard asks her on a date. He also successfully ""converted"" her to Atheism though this was probably just said because she was afraid to lose the first man who has found her attractive, in the future they get married and rid the world of religion, however thanks to [[Eric Cartman]] who uses the [[Crank Prank Time Phone|time phone in]] ""[[Go God Go XII]]"" to contact Mr. Garrison he reveals to Richard the truth about the sex change operation and doing so proceeds Richard to break up with her and runs out of the house in disgust.

Allison was one of the women who Ms. Garrison experimented with in ""[[D-Yikes!]]"" and officially made her a lesbian, it is unclear if they were dating or just friends with benefits, however after the events of the episode it may be clear that they never spoke again.

Mr. Garrison does not have many interactions with the boys outside his role of teacher, he usually shows annoyance toward them and frequently talks to them in a very vulgar way, though he is sometimes shown to explicitly dislike Cartman personally (like most of the other teachers), even once threatening to break his legs and burn his house down in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"". Sometimes however they can show sympathy toward each other. In ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", he shows concerns for Stan when he saw that he has a black eye, thinking that his parents beat him but when Stan is explaining to him that it was caused by his sister, Mr. Garrison loses any worries and get mad at Stan for ""making him wasting his time"". In ""[[The Succubus]]"", he explains to the boys that Veronica is a succubus and how she can be defeated. Mr. Garrison is also invited at Cartman's house to look at his seamen in ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It|The Simpsons Already Did It""]].

Rick is Mr. Garrison's current boyfriend who made his debut in ""[[Pajama Day]]"".

When the New Kid is tasked with putting a sign from the [[Goth Kids]] on the table in the community center, Mr. Garrison is able to be seen and briefly talked to. He can be friended on Facebook after completing the ''PTA Problems'' quest.

Herbert Pocket,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Herbert_Pocket,,"was [[Pip Pirrip]]'s roommate in the [[Season Four]] episode ""[[Pip]]"".

Pocket teaches Pip the basics of being a gentleman, such as not putting one's knife in one's mouth, not passing gas at the table, not placing a napkin in the glasses, and not checking one's penis for scabs at the diner table. Pocket had a large collection of baby bunnies, of which [[Estella Havisham|Estella]] killed twenty-five. It is logical to assume he never forgave her for her sins.

He helps Pip defeat [[Miss Havisham]] and is joyful at the prospect of a happy ending. It is announced at the end of the episode that Pocket died of Hepatitis B, which could lead to the fact that he was too good a boy and accidentally pricked himself on a drug needle through which it was contracted.

Pocket is a cheerful bloke with combed strawberry blonde hair, large front teeth, and a crooked smile. He wears brown pants, a red vest over a white formal shirt, and a large teal bow tie.

Hillary Clinton,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Hillary_Clinton,,"was the 67th United States Secretary of State under President [[Barack Obama]] and was the First Lady of the United States under her husband [[Bill Clinton]]'s presidency.

In ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", a news broadcast showed a photograph of Clinton, with the anchorman saying that her ""ass just keeps getting bigger.""

She appears again in ""[[The Snuke]]"" and portrayed as a driven individual, who will ""not be bullied by terrorist threats"". However, she discovers there is a Snuke in her vagina. Her fate is unresolved until ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"" where she is one of the celebrities suing the town, and questions [[Tom Cruise]] about the possibility of their careers being ruined.

She briefly appeared in the ""[[Queef Free]]"" song in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"".

Hillary is featured as [[Turd Sandwich]] in the episode ""[[Member Berries]]"", where she is the rival presidential candidate in the United States election against [[Herbert Garrison]], who is known as [[Giant Douche]] in the media.

She later makes a cameo during the ending of ""[[Put It Down]]"" where she pledges that if she becomes President, she will put down her phone and not tweet. However, the chorus rejects her pledge by telling her that ""no one cares"" about her.

Hillary Clinton has short, blonde hair, blonde eyebrows, and abnormally large buttocks. She was shown in a long sleeve, thick collar, light brown shirt, and brown pants. Later on in ""[[Member Berries]]"" her hair has slightly gotten whiter and wears a blue shirt. In ""[[The Damned]]"" she is wearing a red shirt.

In ""[[The Snuke]]"", she is manipulative, using the fact that she ""came from a small town"" to get [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'s citizens to vote for her in the 2008 Presidential race. Though she is sometimes shown to be stupid as she continues to say ""My opponent is a liar and can not be trusted"", due to her advisors telling her to say it before, even though Mr. Garrison is giving her the power.

Hippies,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Hippies,,"were the subject in the [[Season Nine]] episode, ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"". They had a brief appearance in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", when [[the Coon]] and [[Cthulhu]] kill many hippies in [[San Francisco]] and at the Burning Man festival.

Hippies invade [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] when [[Mayor McDaniels]] allows a Hippie Jam Festival event. They are portrayed as liberal, lazy, incompetent, and whiny. Preferring to attend jam band festivals, complain about the corporations and the degradation of the environment, but they are not motivated enough to do actually anything about it.

[[Eric Cartman]] tries to rid the town of hippies by operating a hippie extermination business and imprisons some of them in his basement.

[[Officer Barbrady]] sets them free from Cartman's house after a few missing person complaints. Cartman is then arrested for false imprisonment but is let out when his assumptions about the hippie infestation are proven correct. Cartman forms the Hippie Core Drilling Team to save [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Kenny McCormick]] from the hippies and break up the Hippie Jam Festival. They use the [[Hippie Core Drill Machine]] to break through the crowd and get to the stage. Once there, he assaults the audience with a recording of heavy metal band Slayer's ""[[Raining Blood]]"". This plan works and drives all the hippies away, thus saving the town.

The hippies wear tye-dye and colorful clothes and long unkempt hair. There is usually a cloud of marijuana smoke around them.      
Giggling stoners can be found in odd locations and may have no recollection of how they got there.

The college know-it-all hippies convince [[Stan Marsh]] the corporate ""fat cats"" are manipulating the public and destroying the environment because they were taught by college hippie teachers throughout their first year or two.

These types of hippies will gather to play drums in any location. If left alone, the drum circle could grow to many miles in circumference.

Hippie Jam Band Festival musicians have the ability to play for multiple hours or even days without stop. They claim their music will destroy the capitalist corporations and inspire people to protect the environment.

Hollywood Elites,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywood_Elites,,"are an alleged secret cabal of high-profile figures and celebrities who are secretly [[Satan]]-worshipping, child-murdering pedophiles according to the [[QAnon]] conspiracy theory. They are mentioned throughout the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"" where the local branch of QAnon tries to stop them.

The alleged cult is comprised of Hollywood actors and directors, as well as various left-wing political figures. According to the theory, these powerful, ""elite"" individuals murder and molest children so they can harvest a substance called [[adrenochrome]] from children's blood for a euphoric and life-enhancing benefit. They depend on adrenochrome to maintain their positions of power, which allow them to control the masses. They were allegedly exposed when the billionaire [[Jeffrey Epstein]] was found guilty of sex trafficking which, according to the theory, was to lead to him revealing the activities of these ""elites"" in Hollywood and in [[Washington D.C.]] who had used his child sex services. When he was later found dead in his prison cell from suicide, the theory claims this was caused by the cabal to prevent him from coming forward about their activities. QAnon believes that they will continue to do so until common people stand up against them. They strongly support the forty-fifth President of the [[United States]], [[Herbert Garrison]], and believe that he will help them in the ""Great Awakening"", which will involve a mass arrest of these elites and their ultimate defeat.

The theory also claims that these individuals place mind-control chips in the [[COVID-19]] vaccines and that anyone who gets vaccinated is going to be tracked and manipulated for the rest of their lives. Therefore, people should not take the [[COVID-19 Vaccine|vaccine]] in order to avoid being controlled. Hoping to prevent vaccinations and to spread their beliefs, QAnon's [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] branch set up a home tutoring service, [[Tutornon]], to advocate against vaccinations and brainwash the local children to join their movement. These children form the children's arm of QAnon, [[Lil' Qties]].

When [[Herbert Garrison]] retires from politics and tries to get his old life as a teacher back, he is approached by [[Bob White]], leader of the South Park branch of QAnon. Bob reveals he may have discovered where the Hollywood Elites are, and that it comes down to only ""two people"" who ""feed on the torture and pain of children"" and ""run the whole damn show"". He is cut off when he tries to reveal more information. When he and Garrison trudge through the snow to [[South Park Elementary]] in an effort to confront and expose them, the elites begin editing them digitally to enforce their will. Bob insists they ""make a joke of everything"" to discredit his beliefs, and is turned into a giant penis. Garrison, however, chooses to side with them for their power, and decides to make a deal with them instead of fighting them. An airplane from [[Israel]] arrives with enough vaccines for the whole town as previously requested, enabling Garrison to win the trust and support of the townspeople back, and later, reunited with [[Mr. Hat]] through their deal, he looks up to the elites and thanks them, ""Nice doing business with you, you little child-murdering pedophiles"".

The Hollywood Elites all wear dark hooded robes that conceal their identities.

In his [[Whites Basement Q Hideout|basement]], Bob White put up photos of multiple celebrities he believes to be in the cult on his notice board. Some photos of celebrities who appear on his notice board are:

Horace was one of the campers who ended up being picked up by a fake ice cream truck and taken back to camp after an attempt to escape; at this point he couldn't bear to go without eating a candy. Later, his parents realize that their son hasn't lost any weight and blame the counselors for it, threatening to pull their son out of camp and tell all the campers' parents about the camp being a fraud. In the end, Horace feels guilty for not having made the effort to lose his weight and tells his parents that the counselors were doing a good job and that he is finally going to make the effort to lose his weight, which ends up convincing the parents of all kids to give counselors another chance.

Horace acts more childlike than the other children, believing that the ""greasy monster"" was real, until later realizing that he was just one of the [[Rick and Susan|counselors]] wearing a costume. This led Cartman to call him ""retarded"". He also seems to be concerned about his weight.

Horace has curly brown hair and wears the standard white Hopeful Hills uniform. Outside the camp he was seen wearing a cyan shirt and brown shorts. Like the other campers, he is overweight and has a double chin.

When the boys and Charles being chased by the police return to Cartman residence, Howard realizes that the police were after Charles and comes out of the basement with a rifle and keeping everyone else from the hostage family while trying to figure out a way to escape without let the police see them. He then tries to get out the bathroom window but Charles tells him to go alone and that he will surrender to the police. Howard for some reason surrenders to the police with him, and before he is finally taken back to prison, apologizes to his parents (Cartman's grandparents) for what he has done.

In ""[[Royal Pudding]]"", Eric says that his uncle is second in line to be manager of Gart Brothers, possibly referring to Howard.

He seems to be willing to break the law, breaking out of jail. He also seems fearless, even yelling at the convicted murderer, Charlie Manson.

He is a member of the Cartman family. He is [[Liane Cartman]]'s brother and [[Eric Cartman]]'s uncle.

He breaks out of prison, and has the boys hide him and bring him food.

Howard breaks out of jail with Charlie Manson. We can assume they are friends because Charlie stayed with Howard, even after breaking out of jail.

[[File:5a.jpg|thumb|left|Ike on [[South Park Studios]].]]
Ike was adopted by [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] and [[Sheila Broflovski]]. Ike's birth parents, [[Harry and Elise Gintz]] (who christened Ike ""Peter"") gave him up for adoption because Canada had been ""devastated by the Cola Wars"" and as a result, they were unable to raise a child.

This fact was introduced after the flappy heads and beady eyes were established as Canadian traits in the world of South Park. Since Ike was designed with both, [[Matt Stone|Matt]] and [[Trey Parker|Trey]] decided to make Ike Canadian by birth, and therefore, adopted.

In the fourth season, it is revealed that Ike is a genius, and is sent to kindergarten early. This was not evident at first however, proof of Ike's genius is visible in many later episodes. He composes sheet music, reads John Steinbeck, and watches ""The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer"" every night. In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', he expertly played the harmonica when Kyle hid him in the attic, and in ""[[Smug Alert!]]"", Ike finished several of Kyle's sentences when the boys tried to tell their father that he is becoming alienated from his friends. In the same episode, when offered LSD, Ike asked for ""3 hits"". He also once made a perfect replica of Leonardo da Vinci's ""Last Supper"" painting out of macaroni as a project for his [[Jewbilee Camp|Jewish camp]], which completely offended his unimpressed troop leader. In ""[[About Last Night...]]"", he is seen helping [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] steal the Hope Diamond, as a demolition specialist and computer hacker. He can play the piano very well in ""[[Fatbeard]]"" and seems to know how to drive a boat.

In ""[[Stanley's Cup]]"", the South Park Pee-Wee hockey team hires Ike to join their team based solely on the fact that he is Canadian. To the other members of the Pee-Wee team, Ike seems to be a very good player, due to the fact that he can hit pucks into the goal, while the other members could not do so.

Ike is at times very aware of things going on around him, from trying to reconcile with his brother to auditioning for [[Eric Cartman]]'s [[Fingerbang|boy band]] and flipping Cartman off when he does not make the cut. Ike was also aware of how unpopular he initially was with his kindergarten classmates, who were jealous of the fact that he was admitted at only age three. However, he rallied enough support to force a tie in the election for class president, finally winning when his opponent (who was fed up with all the negotiations and meddling by his aunt Rosie O'Donnell) conceded defeat.

Ike has falsely attempted suicide twice, once in ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"" and again in ""[[About Last Night...]]"" (but that was only to get to the hospital computers when he was hired by both [[John McCain|McCain]] and [[Barack Obama|Obama]]).

In the episode ""[[Fatbeard]]"" Ike joins Cartman's pirate crew and goes to Somalia with him because he grew tired of his home life. However, when he and Butters hear the story of a real Somalian pirate, who tells them they should not want to be a pirate and that they should be happy with their lives in America, he wants to go home again. This is one of the first episodes where Ike's dialogue is actively coherent to the audience throughout the entire episode as opposed to nonsensical comments.

Kyle is known to punt Ike like a football after saying, ""Kick the baby!"", to which Ike responds, ""Don't kick the (goddamn) baby!""

Because he is a genius, Ike was accepted into kindergarten at the age of 3. There, [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] nominates him for class president, Ike's opponent being [[Filmore]]. The vote is tied, as a little classmate of theirs named ""Flora"" (spoofing Florida's role in the 2000 US Presidential Election) cannot make up her mind and [[Rosie O'Donnell|Filmore's aunt]] shows up to demand that Filmore be declared class president. Eventually, Filmore gives up and Ike becomes class president (to which he can only exclaim (loudly), ""I pooped my pants!"").

At one point, Ike has an affair with his kindergarten teacher, [[Ms. Stevenson]], during which he loses his virginity, becoming the youngest person on the show to do so. They planned to run off to Milan (to which Ike replies, ""Yay, Mulan!"", confusing Milan with the Disney character [[Mulan]]). Before they leave, Kyle helps him come back to his senses. As Ike and his teacher are on the roof of a hotel, they both run to the edge, but Ike skids to a stop. Ms. Stevenson jumps anyway and leaps to her death.

In a plot involving his Canadian heritage, the Canadian Prime Minister, with the help of the Canadian critic (and [[Terrance and Phillip]] nemesis) [[Scott the Dick]], passed a new law forcing Canadian parents to take back children they put up for adoption; this included Ike's birth parents. However, when the Prime Minister was revealed to be [[Saddam Hussein]], his new laws were repealed, and Ike went back to his adopted family.

In the episode ""Stanley's Cup"", Ike is on a Pee-Wee hockey team coached by [[Stan Marsh]]. He joins the team simply because of the fact that he is Canadian, and thus as a stereotype must be a superior hockey player. During a practice session, he demonstrated shooting skills far beyond those of his teammates. According to Kyle, Ike was not allowed to play because of how dangerous it was and their mother's fears, yet Stan promises that Ike will be okay. However, the team plays in place of the Colorado Avalanche since their intended Pee-Wee opponents did not show up, and Ike, along with the other children, was injured badly by the Detroit Red Wings.

Ike can sing as well, as seen in the episodes ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", where he auditions for the boy band, and ""[[Erection Day]]"", where Ike sings 'The Yankee Doodle Boy' in the talent show.

In the episode ""[[Canada on Strike]]"", Ike is shown standing up for Canada and holding a sign with the words ""Honk if you support Canada"".

Ike has a more grown-up dialogue in ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"", not speaking with his normal childlike voice.

Also in the episode ""[[About Last Night...]]"" he is the last member of Obama's team to act in their plot, by faking an injury because [[John McCain]] lost, and while he was in the hospital, he performed his tasks by destroying a plane filled with decoys of the presidential candidates and hacking into the hospital's computer to type in Obama and his team deceased, showing a high level of intellect and computer skills.

In ""[[Royal Pudding]]"", Ike dresses up as in a school play but is crying over the kidnapping of the Princess of Canada. Ike is shown having a Canadian Faith Box, which appears quite old. Ike may have acquired this with his birth or by his biological parents, who took him back to Canada for a short time. In the same episode, Ike is knighted by the princess after he rescues her.

During [[Season Twenty]], Ike is being constantly used by his father to troll under the name of [[Skankhunt42]] when he is stuck in [[Denmark]], because of the fact he is too young for someone to believe him. In ""[[Members Only]]"", as Gerald guides him to put a penis in a woman's mouth, his mother finds out and assumes he is the Skankhunt. When she contacts her husband, he ditches Ike and acts like Ike is the real troll. As he is being sat on the corner, Kyle realizes that it was not him but their father. Until ""[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]"" when Sheila finds out Ike was not really the troll using [[TrollTrace.com]], Ike and Kyle try multiple times to run away or use the computer for several reasons until driving their mother completely insane, and finally locking her in the pantry to finish the job.

According to his [[Harry and Elise Gintz|birth parents]] in ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", Ike's birth name is Peter Gintz. In ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"", it is revealed that his full name is Ike Moisha Broflovski, as written on his grave. Ike is short for the Hebrew name Isaac.

Ike is easily recognized by his baby body, small beady eyes, the standard flopping Canadian head, and a short tuft of black hair. He wears a blue onesie, with white ovals on the bottom of the feet area. Instead in ""[[Insecurity]]"" and ""[[Christmas Snow]]"" he wears a white onesie with pink trim, blue cuffs and pink, yellow and blue circles (similar to [[Butters Stotch]]'s). He has also been shown wearing a green shirt with a boat on it and black shorts. It is mentioned in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" that he has freckles. Unlike most [[Canada|Canadians]], Ike has a visible nose.

In the future timeline set on ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', he has grown a mustache and a thicker hair. He wears a turquoise sweater with gray patterns and gray pants. In addition, his body has evolved to be a completely geometric figure along with adult Canadians, and his nose has disappeared.

Ike appears to idolize his older brother. He has often tried to follow him to school as shown in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" and ""[[Cancelled]]"". He often copies the words Kyle has said, even obscenities, as shown in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Conversely, one of the few examples of Ike getting angry at Kyle occurred when Kyle interrupted Ike's news program and changed the channel. Kyle has superficial malice towards Ike, but in several episodes, most notably ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]],"" it is shown that Kyle does indeed love his brother. In ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", Ike was angry with Kyle because he tried to break up his relationship with the Kindergarten teacher. Furthermore, he is clearly heard saying, ""You are dead to me, Kyle!""

Ike often tries to pronounce words but fails. However, in the episode ""[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]"", he can say, ""penis"" and ""vagina"" quite clearly and in ""[[Cancelled]]"" he tells Kyle to ""suck my balls"". Despite his intelligence, Ike often replies to questions with random answers. Some of Ike's random statements are ''""cookie monster,""'' ''""Ring Around the Rosie,""'' ''""I pooped my pants,""'' ''""I don't like medicine,""'' and various nonsensical burbling. Statements like these tend to serve as catch-all phrases and non sequitur answers to questions Ike is asked. Even in a heated argument with Kyle in ""Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,"" Ike can clearly be heard saying, ""Ring Around the Rosie!"" in an angry tone.

In the future timeline of ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', Ike speaks in the typical Canadian manner, constantly using words such as buddy, guy, and friend.

Ike is the adopted child of Sheila and Gerald Broflovski. They have been shown to love him very much, becoming extremely upset when he was taken back to Canada in ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"". He seems to love them as well, originally not wanting to go back to Canada with his biological parents.

Harry and Elise are Ike's birth parents. In ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", they are shown to love Ike very much. However, this love is one-sided; Ike does not seem to love them back.

Ike is the younger, adopted brother of Kyle. He seems to idolize Kyle, copying his words and actions. They have had falling outs before; however, as of recent seasons, they seem to be on good terms, however, on [[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]], their relationship has become very strained because of Ike having a sexual relationship with his kindergarten teacher and which cause Kyle to tell Cartman and have her arrested, much to Ike's anger.

Ike is seen in his pirate costume from Fatbeard in the playground at the Kids' Park. If the player interacts with him, he will yell ""I am a pirate king!"". Ike does not react if the player attacks or farts on him. 

When battling with Kyle, the famous ""Kick the Baby"" is used as an attack. When laying siege to Clyde's fortress, Ike tries to launch a firework but is stopped by a cyclops. The player can launch the firework for him (which kills the Cyclops) and Ike befriends him. Kyle's first ability, (Summon Elemental) features Ike, where the player must hold down a button (or mash the key shown on the screen when prompted on PC) while Kyle is charging up a ""Kick the Baby!"" punt, then when he lights up, they let go of the button. If done correctly, Ike will fly at the opponent wielding two knives, shouting ''""YAAAAAAY!""'' before slashing at the opponent smoothly. Otherwise, he will run away crying, causing Kyle to chase him down to hug him.

During the game's early design changes Ike one draft had a design to have him be a dwarf, which a boss fight would have occurred of him riding a bat with a background taken place in a cave. A second Elf Warrior design for Kyle's first move, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?vIke is seen at the [[Broflovski Residence]]. He remains in his room, on his computer, and is one of the people you can take a selfie with. Taking a selfie with him will also allow the player to take a selfie with [[Filmore Anderson|Filmore]].

Immigrant Kids,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Immigrant_Kids,,"are minors who have been forcibly separated from their parents and detained due to the immigration policy of the [[United States]]. Most of them are Hispanics who snuck into the United States from the [[Mexico|Mexican border]] with their parents. They first appear in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode, ""[[Mexican Joker]]"".


Due to the change of immigration policy in the United States, the [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) arrest a large number of immigrants suspected of entering the United States illegally. The minors are separated from their parents and detained at a [[ICE Detention Center|detention center]] in Texas. As anyone can give an anonymous tip-off, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] gets [[Portal:Characters/Families#Broflovski/Schwartz Family|Kyle's family]] detained and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] gets sent to the detention center. Later, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] gets Cartman sent there in revenge.

The living conditions at the detention centers are very poor. The immigrant kids sleep on the ground and are only given aluminum foil as blankets. Kyle asks ICE officers [[Jeff Corrigan]] and [[Dave (ICE Officer)|Dave]] if the ICE is concerned at all about what they're doing to the kids, pulling them away from their families and making them despise the US government. He explains that their actions are creating a ""Mexican Joker"" who is going to grow up to take revenge and fight back.

The ICE officers misunderstand this and get very anxious about the prospect of a Mexican Joker and try various methods to prevent that from happening. They put up a puppet show with Mexican Joker raping Princess Star. They even administer electroshock therapy to the immigrant kids, thinking that this ""treatment"" would help the Mexican Joker overcome his traumatic experience.

At the end of the episode, Kyle and Cartman make many bowler hats out of aluminum foil and scissors and convert the immigrant kids to Judaism in a bid to get them released, as the ICE officers consider imprisoning [[Jews]] to be ""racial discrimination"". However, at that time, Jeff and the ICE officers believe they are experiencing a flashback of the Mexican Joker. They check on the children and see Kyle converting them to Judaism. In a panic that one of them is the Mexican Joker, Jeff shoots and kills his colleagues. He gets ready to release the children in custody. Kyle yells at Jeff that there is, in fact, no Mexican Joker, and tries to explain that he was using an analogy. Jeff, dumbfounded, suddenly blurts out, ''""I must be in the wrong flashback""'', runs away down the hall, and drives away.

Following the Mexican Joker incident, there have been changes in the ICE detention centers, such as holding children in separate rooms and allowing American citizens to adopt them. The [[Portal:Characters/Families#White Family|White family]] visits the ICE detention center to adopt a boy after their son [[Jason White]] was run over by a car. They adopt [[Alejandro White|Alejandro]], a Mexican child introduced by Jeff. They later adopt younger [[Panamanian Padengo Pequeño]] for Alejandro to look after in a bid to pacify his unhappiness. However, being denied his family for so long and being forced to put on white sunscreen, Alejandro finally snaps and begins to cause havoc while looking like the Mexican Joker. The Whites try to intervene, but the police begin shooting while he makes his escape.

They are of varying appearances but they are all Hispanic with black hair.

Jack Tenorman,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jack_Tenorman,,"was [[Eric Cartman]]'s and [[Scott Tenorman]]'s father who appeared (and eventually died) in the [[Season Five]] episode, ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"".

[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] bought Scott Tenorman's pubic hair in ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", thinking that it was the means by which to reach maturity. Finding out that he was mistaken, he attempts to get revenge on Scott.

After several fruitless attempts, Cartman creates an elaborate scheme in which he tricks Scott into convincing his parents to ""save"" a pony from being slaughtered at [[Bill Denkins]]'s ranch. In the meantime, he told Denkins that Jack and his wife were both a pair of demented pony-killers who should be shot on sight. When Scott's father Jack and his mother attempted to save the pony, they were shot dead by Denkins. While he filed a report to [[Officer Barbrady]], Cartman gathered their bodies and then proceeded to grind them up and feed them to Scott as chili.

The fact that his parents were murdered and that he later ate them, drove Scott completely insane. In ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"", it is discovered that during his time in a mental institution, Scott began to research Cartman's history in the hopes of exacting revenge upon him. During his research, Scott discovered that his own father Jack Tenorman had played right tackle for the [[Denver Broncos]] during his younger years and that during the night of the [[Drunken Barn Dance]], he had sex with Cartman's mother [[Liane Cartman|Liane]] resulting in her getting pregnant with [[Eric Cartman|Eric]].

It is unknown whether or not Jack was ever aware of the pregnancy. However, Liane seemed to have informed the rest of the town. Due to the fact that the Denver Broncos had been having a really good year, they all believed that revealing that Jack Tenorman having a bastard child who wants to meet him could be enough to distract him from the football season. As such, when Eric years later, attempted to discover the truth about his father in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"" and ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"", the entire town covered up the truth and altered the paternity results, and told Eric that his mother was in truth his father, due to her being a hermaphrodite.

After discovering this, Scott Tenorman resurrected the [[Ginger Separatist Movement]] that Cartman had once formed, in order to use them in an elaborate scheme to reveal the truth to Cartman in the hopes of demoralizing him. Scott's plan unfortunately worked, but not in the way he intended: Cartman was horrified by what he learned, using the ginger excuse to cover up that he was sad about killing his dad.

Jack Tenorman was a team member of the Denver Broncos, so it was assumed when he played football professionally, he wore the team uniform. When he wasn't playing football, he wore a teal shirt with a black tie and black trousers. He had red hair, red eyebrows, and a red mustache.

Jason White,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jason_White,,"is a student at [[South Park Elementary]] and a friend of [[Craig's Gang]] known for his love of sports, though he has rarely spoken. He is voiced by [[Trey Parker]]. 

He was killed off in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode ""[[Season Finale]]"" after he was run over by a police car, but in ""[[The Big Fix]]"", he can be seen alive in multiple scenes, playing on the playground as well as at the school assembly.

""Ya, seriously, killer."" from ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"".
*'''Jason:''' ""This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!"" from ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"".
*'''Clyde:''' ""Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.""<br/>'''Jason:''' ""No dude, then it won't be fun to watch!"" from ""[[Marjorine]]"".
*'''Jason:''' ""Dude, I'm open!""<br/>'''Cartman:''' ""You can't catch!""<br/>'''Jason:''' ""Dude, I'm wide open!"" from ""[[Season Finale]]"".

Jason first appeared in the cafeteria during ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" as a background character, in a shot that was reused in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"" with some basic dialogue, but did not appear otherwise. A revised version of the character first appeared in ""[[Professor Chaos]]"" as a candidate for the boys' new fourth friend, making it past the first cut though he has no dialogue.

He made his first major speaking appearance in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", seen with [[Craig's Gang]] when they wore matching outfits as metrosexuals, alongside [[Craig Tucker]], [[Tolkien Black]], and [[Tweek Tweak]]; he makes his only appearance in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] classroom in this episode.

He was also part of the group who helped recover the ""future telling device"" in ""[[Marjorine]]"", waiting with [[Timmy]] outside the containment center for the rest of the boys to return.

He is also one of the members of the boys' class involved in trying to capture the leprechaun in ""[[Imaginationland]]"", openly expressing his surprise when they manage to capture it.

In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"" and ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"" he is sitting with the main boys in the cafeteria and their extended friend group, including Craig, Tolkien and Jimmy. In the latter episode, he explains what High School Musical is and expresses disbelief at the kids' lack of familiarity with the fad.

He can still be seen as part of the boys' extended circle eating pizza with them in ""[[Margaritaville]]"" and at Cartman's viewing party in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", in both appearances alongside the other five members of Craig's gang. After this season, he began to appear less often among the boys' extended group. 

He was present at Cartman's sleepover in ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"", acting with [[DogPoo Petuski]] as one of Cartman's core Border Guards.

In ""[[The Hobbit]]"", he walked past [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Wendy Testaburger]] in the hallway at the same time she mentioned Jason having freckles.

His family was finally introduced in ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"", when his father [[Bob White]] and mother [[Mrs. White]] are seen comforting his sister [[Crystal White]] and visiting [[PC Principal]] to complain that the school is too liberal and causing his kids to be afraid of [[Herbert Garrison|the President]]. When they summon their children, Jason appears and looks at the floor and does not speak throughout the scene. When his parents later try to free the President at the end of the episode and his family summons him, he similarly looks at the ground and does not speak. He appears submissive to his parents.

Jason was killed off in ""[[Season Finale]]"" while playing football with the other boys in the park, and rushing into the street to catch the ball as [[Eric Cartman]] tosses it, getting hit by a police car in the process, to the horror of his classmates. His family was seen holding a sparsely attended funeral where he was eulogized by [[Father Maxi]], discussing his playful nature and love of sports, and his own father, who complained that nobody seemed to care that a 'White' was killed by police, and complaining that now there were 'less Whites'. Urged on by Cartman, claiming he had been close with Jason, the Whites take the opportunity to adopt another child, [[Alejandro White]]. Mrs. White compare them unfavorably, pointing out Jason never tried to rebel against their authority such as by making long-distance phone calls. They also cite Jason's death as a motivation to buy more marijuana from [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]]. 

In ""[[The Big Fix]]"", Jason could be seen at school on the playground playing tether ball and in an assembly raising his hand to indicate he knew Tolkien's correct name, appearing to have been somehow revived. He is fully animated in both sequences, unlike previous oversights like [[Betsy Donovan]], and was not removed from the uncensored cut of the episode.

Jason was known for his playful nature among the townspeople, and seemed well-liked among his classmates, frequently invited to larger gatherings or to play games. He participated in many of the other children's role-playing games, playing along under even Cartman's authority as a Border Patrol agent in the Texans vs. Mexicans game and dedicating himself to the role of an elven shopkeeper in the boys' fantasy role-playing game. He was especially known for his love of sports, however. He was known as a member of both the South Park Cows' basketball team as well as the football and soccer teams, and had a reputation for enjoying playing sports in his free time as well, joining the kids for games of football on the playground and at the park. He also expressed once that a football game would be less fun to watch if knowing the outcome in advance. At his funeral, [[Father Maxi]] observed it was his playful nature with sports that lead to his untimely death.

Jason seemed embarrassed or intimidated by his [[Bob White|father's]] outbursts, remaining silent and often looking down or away from him, though he was evidently surprised when his father pulled out a weapon. He is never seen speaking in his parents' presence. He was also evidently obedient to their demands, as after his death, his mother remarks that he did not use his phone outside of designated phone hours. His family was later shown hitting their subsequently adopted child, [[Alejandro White]] for misbehaving, suggesting Jason's reluctance to speak and obedience may have been a result of similar abuse. 

Jason's quiet nature stood in contrast to his parents, who were known for their outspoken nature among the other adults, and often seemed to prefer following the other students, like [[Craig Tucker]], and seemed concerned about what was popular, expressing his surprise that the boys were unfamiliar with ''High School Musical'' and citing its popularity with their age group. He often spoke up when expressing disbelief or surprise, such as when the boys succeeded in capturing a leprechaun, or when [[Butters Stotch]] exposed himself at a volleyball game. He often appeared rather stoic or expressionless in serious situations however, even compared to other background characters, watching blankly when [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] gets crushed to death by the [[Giant Reptilian Bird]] or when [[Snooki]] sinisterly appears behind Cartman during ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", in which everyone appears to be concerned apart from him.

Cartman observed in his opinion that Jason ""couldn't catch"" and suggested that he had been clumsy, blaming this for his death being ran over by [[Park County Police Force|police officer's vehicle]] when he tried to catch a ball Cartman had thrown in the street, although this could be seen as avoiding blame for Jason's death considering Cartman was the one who threw it.

Jason has dark brown hair with noticeable sideburns and a high forehead with a receded hairline. He wears a purple jacket and a pair of blue jeans, which were originally orange. In ""[[The Hobbit]]"", Wendy mentions that he has freckles. His character is based on [[wikipedia:Jason McHugh|Jason McHugh]], who was featured with [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] in ''Cannibal! The Musical'' and ''Orgazmo''.

[[File:Marjorine97.png|thumb|left|120px|Jason, with [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]] and [[Francis]].]]
Jason's friendships and relationships were never well-defined in his appearances. He was most notably a member of [[Craig's Gang]] during the metrosexual fad in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", and was still seen alongside them in larger gatherings with the boys such in the cafeteria during the twelfth season such as ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", eating pizza in ""[[Margaritaville]]"" at Cartman's viewing party in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"" and at a sleepover in ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"".

His closest friend may have been [[Tweek Tweak]]. Both boys appeared in Craig's Gang during the meterosexual fad, and then were no longer with them in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", but continued to appear together. They were seen together most notably when they were invited together to a party at [[Bebe Stevens]]' home during the Stupid Spoiled Whore fad. They are also next to each other in ""[[Marjorine]]"", ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"" and ""[[Imaginationland]]"". He also may have been friendly with Tolkien outside the group, as they were both on the same Cows basketball team together. Tweek was noticeably more upset with Jason's death than their other classmates present. 

Cartman once referred to himself as ""pretty close"" with Jason, and they seemed to be friendly. Jason was among the boys who helped him to trap Kyle at the nearby [[Sizzler]] during the Jersey invasion effort, where [[DogPoo Petuski]] and [[Bill Allen]] were also present. He and Dogpoo were also both invited to play Texans vs. Mexicans at Cartman's House, where they both served as Border Patrol agents for Cartman. Dogpoo was also present for Jason's death. He also played with Bill on the basketball team and appeared next to him in ""[[The Hobbit]]"" when Wendy discussed the boys' flaws. He and Bill both joined Tweek in the PlayStation 4 Army in ""[[Black Friday]]"". 

He was also often seen nearby or talking with Kevin Stoley, implying a possible friendship, such as at Cartman's House in ""[[Marjorine]]"" or during the volleyball game in ""[[Wieners Out]]"".

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", [[Emily Marx]] is seen breaking up with him toward the end of the episode. Prior to this episode, they can be seen talking to each other in the hallways in various episodes.

Staring in ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", he was often seen sitting by [[Scott Malkinson]], [[Tommy Turner]], [[Daniel Tanner]], and a few unidentified background characters in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|cafeteria]].

Jason played a minor role in the game as a member of the Drow Elf faction, tending the armory at the [[Elven Kingdom]] and acting as the faction's merchant. You have to buy equipment from him to befriend him. This is one of the few times he speaks, and the only time you interact with him in the game, though he appears in the cutscenes throughout. Jason says, ""Any ally of the Elf King is an ally of mine! And my shop is open to you."" He can also say ""We elves craft the finest shit in the land"" if you go to his shop again.

He can be found in the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] restaurant next to [[Louis Handler]]. [[The New Kid]] can get a selfie with him if they have at least one active [[Class:Brutalist|brutalist]] ability.

Jason White has been a background character since ""[[The Unaired Pilot]]"". It was not until Season 6 where he became an established character in ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", and started to make appearances with the boys until making a full speaking role in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"". Although appeared commonly around the school and would have lines at a few moments, he was never a part of anything major after his first speaking role until his family made their first appearance in ""[[Splatty Tomato]]"". He was still in the same role as he was before, until he was killed in ""[[Season Finale]]"", though he has been revived since ""[[The Big Fix]]"".

She is a parody of the real-life celebrity and is portrayed as a mean spirited, ill-tempered, egotistical and violent woman who becomes furious when Cartman's hand puppet with the same name steals her fame and boyfriend [[Ben Affleck]].

[[File:FatButtandPancakeHead011.png|thumb|left|Handpuppet as Jennifer Lopez on Cartman's hand]]
After years of success as a recording star, actress, and other artistic fields, Jennifer Lopez develops a raging ego and unstable temper, which begins to bother the record executives of her record label. And so when a ""younger"" and ""spicier"" performer by the name of [[Mitch Conner|Jennifer Lopez]] appears on the music scene, the executives become anxious to hire her. However, not wanting to have two Jennifer Lopez's signed to their label, they chose to fire the original one. Lopez does not take the dismissal well, blowing up into a furious rage at being told that she was fired and that she was a ""mean-spirited bitch, who spits on people for being poor"".

She immediately rushes to [[South Park]], with her boyfriend [[Ben Affleck]], so as to confront the new Jennifer Lopez. She's however shocked and confused to find that the new Jennifer Lopez is in fact a ventriloquist puppet of [[Eric Cartman]]. Initially thinking it's a joke, she becomes completely enraged when the hand insults her, to which Lopez threatens to kill her and Cartman if they don't back off. Unknown to Lopez however, Affleck immediately becomes attracted to the new Jennifer.

Soon after, the new Jennifer Lopez begins working on her album and starts dating Affleck behind the old Lopez' back. Again falling into a psychotic fury, Lopez proceeds to attack Cartman's hand with a baseball bat, breaking several fingers in the process. However, the new Jennifer continues to date Affleck and become engaged. This finally sends Lopez over the edge, and she chases down the new Jennifer with a chainsaw, intending to kill her. The police, record executives, Ben Affleck and [[The Boys|the boys]] all chase after the two Lopezes, and Cartman, and are shocked to discover that the new Jennifer Lopez is, in fact, a con-artist named ""Mitch Conner"". Mitch kills himself with a suicide pill, however, Lopez does not return to her music career. Instead, she is arrested for assault and attempted murder, and after being released ends up working at a fast-food taco place.

Lopez is one of the few [[celebrities]] who does not appear in the episodes ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"". Instead, [[Mitch Conner]] appears again, posing once more as Jennifer Lopez.

Jennifer Lopez wears very elegant clothing. She wears a long white skirt, a gray formal shirt with a white collar, a white woman's business coat, and a large white hat with a pearl trimming. She has a plethora of jewelry consisting of several gold necklaces, a pearl necklace, several gold rings with jewels, a pearl wrist band, and emerald earrings. Her accessories include a white purse with a gold chain handle, white glasses, a pink fur scarf, and a white poodle with an emerald and gold necklace of its own. She has long, wavy brown hair. She also wears make-up consisting of pink lipstick and teal eye shadow.

Jennifer Lopez is shown to be aggressive, mean-spirited, volatile, arrogant and violent. She issues threats of violence to those who she feels threatened by and was no problem resorting to violence to get what she wants. She also held a very high opinion of herself and her career and treated people deemed lesser than herself badly; according to one of her formal record label agents, she is a ""mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous"".

Jenny's personality appears to be shaped largely by her family and religion, Mormonism. She is overly friendly and optimistic, like the rest of her family.

Jenny is very close to her parents and they are the people who taught her The Book of Mormon.

Jenny has three brothers and one younger sister. They all share a strong bond and are friendly to each other. They never fight and enjoy spending time together. They all play musical instruments, and perform a song for their parents and [[Stan Marsh]] in ""[[All About Mormons]]"".

Jenny Simons,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jenny_Simons,,"is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth-grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, ""[[The List]]"", as a co-chair of the list-making committee and a member of the counterfeit list conspiracy. She played another major role in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"".

In her first appearance in ""[[The List]]"", she was co-chair of the list-making committee and helped forge the list to make [[Clyde Donovan]] the most popular boy in order to get shoes with all of the other members besides [[Wendy Testaburger]], who later foiled the plot with [[Stan Marsh]]. Although she isn't seen often, the fact that she is co-chair of the List Committee may mean that she is part of the ""popular girls"" clique. She came up with the idea to make a list of liars so nobody would believe Wendy.

Her other major appearance is in ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", in which her full name is revealed. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] tricks her into eating a cupcake filled with laxatives, which makes her defecate in class. Following this incident, Jenny attempts suicide by jumping off a roof but survives the fall with a broken pelvis. She was put on suicide watch, though she has presumably been taken off suicide watch as she was seen as a new member of the cheerleading squad in ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"".

Jenny has long black hair; compared to [[Wendy Testaburger]], her hair is shorter and her bangs are a bit longer. She wears a light blue jacket with dark blue trim, dark blue pants, and a large purple headband. In ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"", she was seen wearing purple gloves outside.
Jenny has a relatively complicated personality. In ""[[The List]]"", she is shown to have no guilt/remorse over undermining a friend as well as several boys' reputations in order to benefit herself, hinting at a lack of empathy. However, aside from [[Wendy Testaburger]], the rest of the girls were doing the same, so her actions could have been due to deindividuation as her future appearances contradict her being remorseless.

In her other appearances, she seems to still be relatively nice and naive, such as in ""[[Bass to Mouth]]."" Although she seemed to know how mean [[Eric Cartman]] was, she felt guilty for refusing to like him back and turning him down after he offered her a cupcake, and immediately apologized because she felt ""[that] was mean"" and accepted the cupcake. She also seems sensitive to social harm as shown by the fact she tried to kill herself from the torment and ridicule after defecating her pants due to Cartman's prank. Fortunately, her suicide attempt failed.

Since her suicide attempt, Jenny has been seen in ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"", where she is seen as a new member of the cheerleading squad and is good friends with them.

From all this info we can tell that her personality is naive, nice, and socially sensitive, like an ordinary girl her age.

Lola is Jenny's best friend. They are seen sitting together at the Pleases & Sparkles club in ""[[The List]]"", and Jenny defends Lola from [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]]'s lashing out by stating that they'll generate a ""biggest liars"" list and put Wendy at #1.

They made a most notable background appearance in ""[[Britney's New Look]]"", where they are seen in the crowd to take pictures of [[Britney Spears]], this time without their daughter.

"Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy",https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jerome_%22Chef%22_McElroy,,"was a recurring character in ''[[South Park]]''. He was most famous for being the [[South Park Elementary]] cafeteria chef and the boys' go-to guy for advice, which would often result into him breaking into songs about sex. He made his debut in the [[Season One]] episode ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" and was voiced by the late Isaac Hayes.

Chef was killed off in the [[Season Ten]] debut episode, ""[[The Return of Chef]]"", following controversy with [[Isaac Hayes]], who left the series after the episode, ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"" aired, due to its portrayal of Scientology.
[[File:15a.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chef on [[South Park Studios]].]]

In ""[[Chef Aid]]"", he along with [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], escape from [[Officer Barbrady]]'s cell, after Mr. Hat breaks the cell wall.
*'''Arson''': In ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", he lights a man on fire.
*'''Soliciting Sex from Minors:''' In ""[[The Return of Chef]]"", he gets brainwashed into being a pedophile after joining the [[Super Adventure Club]] and starts making sexual advances to the boys and other schoolchildren.

""Chef, can you hear me? Say something!""

:'''Connelly:''' [mimicking children's voice] ""Oh, you mean like a chocolate candy?""
:'''Darth Chef:''' ""No, I mean MY BALLS!""

Connelly, as a parody of Darth Sidious, was very happy about Darth Chef's reply and responds with an evil laugh.

Darth Chef's voice was provided by [[Peter Serafinowicz]], who voiced Darth Maul in ''[[w:c:starwars:Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''. However, he has not reappeared. It is now highly unlikely for him to return due to Isaac Hayes' death. Darth Chef does, however, appear along with many other characters in the background of the ''South Park'' opening sequence. While he is in Chef's place in the crowd of waving townspeople beginning right after ""The Return of Chef"", the clip of him waving is inserted into the opening beginning in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"". Instead of waving, he is seen threateningly activating his lightsaber/spatula.

It should be noted the name ""Darth Chef"" has been generally accepted by fans, but is never actually used on the show. It is, however, mentioned on [[South Park Studios]].

*'''Chef:''' ""I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children."" from ""[[The Return of Chef]]"" using dialogue from ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" and ""[[Cancelled]].""

As his nickname implies, Chef was a school cafeteria cook at the [[South Park Elementary|South Park Elementary School]] and former member of [[City Council]] as ""Head of Public Safety"". He was the only adult that the [[The Boys|boys]] ([[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]) consistently looked to for advice. A typical exchange between Chef and the boys goes as such:

:'''Chef''': ""Hello there, children!""
:'''Boys''': [in unison] ""Hey, Chef.""
:'''Chef''': ""How's it goin'?""
:'''Boys''': [one or all] ""Bad.""
:'''Chef''': ""Why bad?""

Chef used the word ""children"" often, even for a singular child. For example, he referred to Cartman as ""children"" in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"" and ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]],"" Stan in ""[[Kenny Dies]],"" and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"". He also tended to use ""fudge"" as a euphemism for ""fuck,"" particularly in early episodes. The various humorously named snacks he made in ""[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]"" epitomized this.

While most of the inhabitants of South Park are Caucasian, Chef was one of the very few residents in town who was African American; in fact, the only other black people to consistently live in South Park are [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] and his parents, who were not prominent characters until the fourth season. As a result, Chef (usually affectionately, though not always) referred to most people in town with the racial slur ""crackers"", often ""cracker-ass"", including the children.

Aside from cooking, Chef was passionate about singing - he wrote the song, ""[[Stinky Britches]]"" which was later covered by [[Alanis Morissette]]. He was based on such 1970s African American singers as [[Isaac Hayes]] and Barry White. Often, he agreed to give the boys advice in the form of songs but wound up singing about having sex. However, over time, like many earlier characters on the show, his role, especially as a singer, diminished, and in later seasons he did not sing much. By the time his death occurred, he had not sung any songs in 4 years or so, with one of the last examples of him singing being ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"".

Despite his preoccupations with women and sex, Chef was generally one of the few level-headed adults in South Park. In addition to dispensing advice to ""the children"", Chef spoke out against outrageous ideas and helped save South Park/the world in general from disasters on numerous occasions. However, Chef was not above performing nonsensical acts, such as [[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer|buying a fancy TV that he could not even program]].
[[File:SPBLAU7.jpg|thumb|Chef would often explain mature themes to [[The Boys|the boys]].]]
In earlier seasons, Chef was often approached by the children when they were unfamiliar with a sexual term or practice. This happened so often that it eventually got on Chef's nerves, leading him to say, ""Goddammit, children, why do I always have to be the one to teach you these things?"", but went on to explain to them whatever they wanted to know anyway.

Chef's last name suggests he could be at least partially of some Celtic descent, and indeed his parents live in Edinburgh, Scotland.

In ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", he briefly converted to Islam and adopted the name ""Abdul Mohammed Jabar Rauf Kareem Ali"", but converted back to Christianity by the end of the episode.

Chef is often seen with the boys, and at times teaches them life lessons through song. But he, like every other citizen in South Park, is more than willing to insult Cartman and call him fat. In ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", Cartman thinks Chef is his father and tries to look like an African-American. In ""[[Chef Aid]]"", the boys attempt to help Chef out of jail by organizing a ""Chef Aid"" concert featuring many celebrities. In ""[[The Succubus]]"", after dating [[Veronica]], he spends less time with the boys and changes a bit.

Chef started dating Veronica in ""[[The Succubus]]"". However, the boys did not approve of her. They sing [[The Morning After|a bad song]] to the boys. Later in the episode, Veronica reveals herself as a succubus, before being banished by the boys.

[[File:1001 chef-torn-apart.jpg|thumb|left|Chef's gruesome death.]]
The fate of Chef was revealed in the Season 10 premiere, in which voice clips taken from previous episodes were linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot of ""[[The Return of Chef]]"". In the episode, Chef was brainwashed into becoming a child molester by the [[Super Adventure Club]], an organization which combines outdoors activities with sex tourism and bizarre religious beliefs, some of which seem akin to those held by the real-life Church of Scientology.

At the end of the episode, Chef was burned, battered, impaled, shot, his face, including one eyeball, was pulled off, and his limbs were torn apart by a grizzly bear and a mountain lion, he gets split in half, and he finally defecated as he died as a reference to the episode ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"".

The town held a moving memorial service for him, in which Kyle gave a eulogy stating, ""We shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us, we should be mad at that fruity little club for scrambling his brains"" - a not-so-subtle jab at Scientology.

[[File:Darth Chef.png|thumb|Darth Chef, as seen in ""The Return of Chef"".]]
Chef's body was secretly recovered by the Super Adventure Club, who managed to revive him as a ""Darth"" Chef, mimicking the ending to ''[[w:c:starwars:Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''. He was revived by the Super Adventure Club in a Darth Vader-esque suit (albeit with a helmet similar to a chef's hat) and was given a red spatula lightsaber. After that, the Super Adventure Club leader [[William Connelly|Connelly]] began the scene, which parodies ''Revenge of the Sith'':
[[File:Darth Chef-0.png|thumb|233x233px]]
:'''Connelly:''' ""Chef, can you hear me? Say something!""
:'''Darth Chef:''' [with respirator-assisted Vader-like breathing] ""Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury steak?""
:'''Connelly:''' ""Yes, go on!""
:'''Darth Chef:''' ""And for dessert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?""
:'''Connelly:''' [mimicking children's voice] ""Oh, you mean like a chocolate candy?""
:'''Darth Chef:''' ""No, I mean MY BALLS!""

Connelly, as a parody of Darth Sidious, was very happy about Darth Chef's reply and responds with an evil laugh.

Darth Chef's voice was provided by [[Peter Serafinowicz]], who voiced Darth Maul in ''[[w:c:starwars:Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''. However, he has not reappeared. It is now highly unlikely for him to return due to Isaac Hayes' death. Darth Chef does, however, appear along with many other characters in the background of the ''South Park'' opening sequence. While he is in Chef's place in the crowd of waving townspeople beginning right after ""The Return of Chef"", the clip of him waving is inserted into the opening beginning in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"". Instead of waving, he is seen threateningly activating his lightsaber/spatula.

It should be noted the name ""Darth Chef"" has been generally accepted by fans, but is never actually used on the show. It is, however, mentioned on [[South Park Studios]].

After Chef died, the children were never seen getting lunch again until ""[[Crème Fraiche]]"", and it was unknown who replaced Chef. However, in ""[[Eek, A Penis!]]"", [[Mr. Derp]] was seen in the background, implying he took over for the time. In ""Crème Fraiche"", the boys are seen in the lunch line and are greeted by [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] with Chef's familiar lines ""Hello there children!"" and ""How's it goin'?"" He also wore an apron that was similar to Chef's, only smaller, and he reveals there was an opening for a cafeteria chef. Chef himself is not directly referenced in the episode though, and Randy quits at the end, meaning it is likely Mr. Derp or another staff member took on the role again.

Chef is seen briefly during a trailer for ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' breaking out from a coffin, partially rotting, much to the shock of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and the new kid. Despite [[The Return of Chef|his final appearance in the show]] depicting him in a Darth Vader-like suit, his appearance in-game is a zombified version of his normal attire (along with the addition of a Nazi Sash around his arm). Chef is brought back to life by Clyde thanks to toxic waste made by aliens as a zombie Nazi as a boss fight, at points Chef will try biting the new kid, only for him to literally knock some sense into him, unfortunately Clyde shoots the toxic waste from a water gun at chef, causing the zombie Nazi personality to take over. At the end of the fight, Chef gains control, but only briefly as Clyde lights him on fire in a last ditch effort to defeat the new Kid, who had no choice but to use magical farts on Chef, burning his face off and killing him again. Chef's dialogue is, much like in Chef's return, comprised of stock audio (both from Isaac Hayes and various speeches from Adolf Hitler).

Chef was referenced in ""[[Stunning and Brave]]"", when [[P.C. Principal]] mentions a ""chef person of color who loved to sing soul songs"", and claims that the children drove him to suicide. [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] corrects him by stating that he was brainwashed by a [[Super Adventure Club|cult]].

[[Image:Isaachayes.JPG|thumb|[[Isaac Hayes]] voiced Chef from 1997 to 2006.]]
On March 13, 2006, [[Isaac Hayes]] was reported to have quit ''South Park'' over objections to the show's attitudes toward and depiction of various religions, claiming that the show had crossed the line from satire into intolerance.

Despite the content of the official press release, however, there remains considerable speculation about the motivations behind his departure. Parker and Stone assert that he quit due to the controversial episode ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"", and its treatment of Scientology, as Hayes was a member of the religion. Series co-creator and writer [[Matt Stone]] commented in a manner that suggested that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on ''South Park'': ""[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin."" Aside from [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]], [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], and their families, Chef was the only African-American character in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He was almost always seen wearing his chef's hat, red shirt and blue pants. He was also often seen wearing a white apron with the word ""Chef"" printed on it. He appeared to be slightly overweight and had a black beard. In ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" his apron text changes from an uppercase ""CHEF"" to a lowercase ""chef"" in one scene.

Chef seems to have worn a chef's hat for most of his life, even when he was not employed as a chef. He wore it as a child, as seen in ""[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]"" and supported by his father's anecdote in ""[[The Succubus]]"". Even when he is employed as an accountant in ""[[The Succubus]]"", his signature hat can be seen hanging up in his office. However, he does not wear it as a young adult in the flashbacks in ""[[Chef Aid]]"" or ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"".

[[Image:TheSuccubus06.gif|thumb|Chef's Parents.]]
[[File:VideoGameChef.png|Chef's model in ''[[South Park (Video Game)|South Park]]''|thumb]]
Chef is a supporting character throughout the game's story and is also a playable character in multi-player mode.

In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', Chef is revived as a Nazi Zombie by [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]. The player referred to as ""[[Douchebag]]"" must fight him as a penultimate boss. It is revealed that he has been stitched back together, however, his skin has turned green (like most zombies in the game), the visible scars and gashes from his brutal death still remain, and his old clothes are tattered (as you would expect). He will quickly switch between his old voice and the Nazi outbursts common among those exposed to the green goo. His voice lines are similar to being replayed from an old episode, much like ""[[The Return of Chef]]"", this is due to how the original voice actor having passed away 6 years prior to the game's release, when making his old voice lines, he is still his old self, showing regret for him being forced to attack the boys, but this is quickly stopped by Clyde, who quickly covers him in the green goo.

Zombie Chef's abilities include: ""Chocolate Salty Balls"" involves him pulling out said balls from the gash in his stomach and will inflict gross out if not blocked, ""Hello Children"": where he attempts to bite the player character (but mashing the corresponding buttons when shown can resist the attack). Or he can use his spatula as a Melee weapon dealing a large amount of damage if it is unblocked (especially to Jimmy or Cartman). 

When the player takes Chef's health down to 1 (from a rather large 73,476 if you are level 15), Chef will fully regain control of himself and proclaim ""Children! Everybody! I'm back!"", before Clyde will throw a Molotov Cocktail at Chef, causing him to violently burst into flames and run around. The player will charge up and release a powerful fart, to which Chef gets caught in the proceeding fireball, killing him and causing him to re-sustain the brutal injuries that lead to his original death, albeit him now being horribly charred. If the player fails to do this quickly then Chef will set the player and their buddy on fire unless they have any shields. Once they have no shields then they will get fire damage and will die soon meaning that they will have to restart the game from the last checkpoint.

[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] decides to prank [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] by dressing up a cow to look ginger, and later shares it online. While it was initially discussed between leaders of Islam, Christianity and Judaism that the appearance of the ginger cow (referred by them as the red heifer) is a sign that Armageddon is coming, they later agree it actually means the end of violence in the Middle East. The cow was eventually brought to Jerusalem and sacrificed, bringing peace upon the people.

The religious leaders declare unity between the three religions and organize a [[Van Halen]] concert as a celebration. The correspondent reports while the concert is underway, labelling Israel as ""the happiest, rockingest place to be.""

In ""[[Insecurity]]"", [[Eric Cartman]] hires Jesse to break into his [[Cartman Residence|house]] and rape his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] and then turns his house's security system on in order to test how long the Wolf Home Security operators take to respond to the security system's alarm.

In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', Jesse breaks into [[The New Kid's Residence]] alongside [[New Kid Residence Intruders|two other intruders]] named Percy and James and must fight them to make them leave. Later on in the game, [[The New Kid]] must fight Jesse and the other intruders again.

Jesse Jackson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Jackson,,"is an African-American civil rights activist. He appears in the episode ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"" where [[Randy Marsh]] ""apologized"" to him after saying the N-word on national TV, by literally kissing his ass.

Jackson also briefly appears in ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"" to support the African-American students in the [[Kindergartners|kindergarten class]] during the class vote, however he immediately left after [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] told him that there were no black students.

Jesse Jackson is African-American. He appears to be drawn with a strange eye shape, which are almost circular, as opposed to the elliptical eyes most characters are drawn with. He has black hair that is greying. In ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", he is dressed in a grey suit and pants, a white shirt and a red tie.

Like his true counterpart, Jackson is extremely passionate about civil rights, doing whatever he can to ensure African-Americans are not discriminated against and sufficiently represented. However, he is also implied to be slightly egotistical. Randy literally kissed Jackson's backside to apologise for a racial slur he uttered on live television. [[Stan Marsh]] thought this would make everything okay, however [[Tolkien Black]] angrily remarked that Jesse Jackson was, ""not the emperor of black people!"" These events were a tongue-in-cheek reference to the apology Michael Richards made to the real Jesse Jackson for a highly insensitive [[wikipedia:Michael Richards#2006 Laugh Factory incident|outburst]] at the California Laugh Factory in 2006.

She was later seen at the [[Jonas Brothers]] concert in ""[[The Ring]]"".

Wendy visits Jessie and [[Kal]] after she realizes that all of her other friends have become sluts, but is dismayed to find that the pair have also decided to become stupid spoiled whores.

She wore a pink magenta tube top with the word ""SLUT"" written on it, a short denim skirt with a side slit, and black high heels with gems on the straps. She bears a marked resemblance to [[Lola]].

While not acting like a Stupid Spoiled Whore, Jessie appeared to be friendly and amicable. However, when she began acting like a Stupid Spoiled Whore, she appeared to act incredibly superficial, unintelligent and promiscuous.

Jessie and [[Kal]] are presumably friends, possibly best friends, as they appear together in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"". However, they have not been seen together on any other occasions, though this is likely due to both characters' lack of screen time.

Jessie appears to be outside [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s immediate circle of friends, but they are shown to be friendly. Wendy decides to hang out with Jessie and Kal when she becomes an outsider to her usual group. However, after both begin acting like whores, she decides to leave.

She is the producer for ''[[Jesus and Pals]]'', [[Jesus]]' reality talk show on [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] public access television. When ''Jesus and Pals'' go into a rating war with [[Jimbo]] and [[Ned]]'s ''[[Huntin' and Killin']]'' show, Jesus is not too concerned but she would do anything to improve the show's ratings. Under her influence, the show gets increasingly raunchy and inappropriate. A commercial for ''Jesus and Pals: Too Hot for TV! '' features topless bikini-clad women and guests yelling obscenities.

After Jimbo and Ned learn that the Mexican Staring Frog is not real, Jimbo, Ned, and [[the boys]] star on ''Jesus and Pals''. During a break, the producer goes behind Jesus' back and tells Jimbo to lie that Stan is a drug addict. A fight breaks out on the show and Jesus finds out the truth.

In ""[[Damien]]"", Jesus has to fight a boxing match against [[Satan]], the Prince of Darkness after his son goes to [[South Park Elementary]]. When Jesus fights Satan, every resident of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] believed he was sure to lose and so, they bet on Satan, resulting in only one person betting on Jesus. That person turned out to be Satan, who throws the match in order to fulfill his plan to steal the townspeople's money to buy real estate.

In ""[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]"", Jesus appears once again as the host of his call-in show ''[[Jesus and Pals]]''. Unfortunately, His show is being outdone in terms of ratings by [[Jimbo Kern]] and [[Ned Gerblansky]]'s show ''[[Huntin' and Killin']]''. In order to compete, Jesus' producer forces him to adopt a less professional style of presentation, fabricating lies in order to increase ratings. By the end of the episode, Jesus has had enough and sends his producer to Hell.

In ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"", Jesus appeared twice, once as a baby during [[Eric Cartman]]'s performance of ""[[O Holy Night]]"", and again during his own duet with Santa, in which he performed a medley of different Christmas songs.

He was also featured in season three for ''South Park's'' millennium New Years' episode, ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"". In the episode, he is worried that for the new millennium, he may get crucified again, so he seizes the new millennium as an opportunity to do something cool. Jesus asks his Father to come down to Earth to impress everyone, but God refuses.
[[File:AreYouThereGodItsMeJesus033.png|left|thumb|Jesus writes to [[God]] in ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"".]]
Instead, Jesus organizes a [[Rod Stewart]] comeback concert. When Rod Stewart could not perform, the crowd goes to crucify Jesus. Jesus sulks with [[Stan Marsh]], who has not got his period yet. Jesus then realizes that God cannot solve everybody's problem and that he should not have asked God to help Him, which cheers up Jesus. With his lesson learned, the Almighty finally does appear to the masses gathered and tells Stan that he is a boy, and boys do not get periods.

Jesus later appears in the fifth-season episode entitled ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", wherein Jesus and other traditional religious prophets, teachers, heroes, and demigods combine forces to fight the evil magician, and head of the [[Blaintology]] cult, [[David Blaine]]. Jesus' power was master carpentry skills, and he performed his biblical miracles by asking the crowd to turn around while Jesus gets what he needs then he asks the crowd to turn back around, to see his ""miracle"".

In the season six finale, ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", he was killed by an Iraqi insurgent by a gunshot through the back while on a high-risk mission to rescue [[Santa Claus]]. He was not seen as an actual character since, until ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", where he has to stop [[Bill Donohue]] from becoming Pope.

In ""[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"", he was featured as a mock-cartoon character in an ""[[Al-Qaeda]]"" production featuring Americans defecating all over each other. The cartoon was an inflammatory retaliation against ''[[Family Guy]]'' showing an image of [[Muhammad]].
[[File:ImaginationlandPartIII18.jpg|thumb|Jesus fighting a Xenomorph in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"".]]
He was also in ""[[Imaginationland]]"", as a member of the [[Council of Nine]], where he and the council discussed the evil imaginary creatures attacking the good side of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]]. Jesus is then seen fighting in the battle, where he is battling against a [[The Alien (Xenomorph)|Xenomorph]] from the movie ''Alien'' until [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] imagines an M-60 for Jesus, which Jesus promptly uses to help win the battle.

In ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", it is revealed that the man Jesus chose to be the first Pope, St. Peter, was not a man at all but [[Saint Peter|a rabbit]]. The reason he chose a rabbit to lead Christianity was that he knew no one man can speak for God without becoming corrupt while rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church, viewing it as blasphemy, covered up the truth and put a man in charge. Ever since then, the secret organization, the [[Hare Club for Men]] has been painting Easter Eggs to keep the secret alive.

In ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"", he appears along with the other Super Best Friends. In ""[[201]]"", he is watching porn while [[Buddha]] snorts some cocaine. However, they later get on their power cycles and move out to stop [[Mecha-Streisand]], which they succeed in by having [[Krishna]] transform into Neil Diamond to sing a duet with her.

[[File:AScauseForApplause091.png|thumb|left|Jesus at [[P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory]]]]

In ""[[A Scause For Applause]]"", Jesus is found utilizing the drug [[Human Growth Hormone (HGH)|HGH]] during his crucifixion, he sneaks into the scientist's house trying to discredit him but meets Stan accidentally. They both decide to focus people's attention on [[Belarusian Farmers]], so they go to [[P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory]] for bracelets. Unfortunately, those farmers are killed, and it turns out that the [[P.F. Pityef|factory owner]] is a phony. Jesus takes doses of HGH and becomes a hulk, destroying the factory and killing its owner. Later he appeals to everyone to wear their causes on T-shirts.

Jesus has long brown hair and a goatee. He usually wears a long white robe and has a halo above his head. Following his appearance in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", he had a slight redesign, additions included a red sash and an updated robe. Prior to his redesign, Jesus's eyes were slightly further apart than the majority of South Park characters.

Like Jimbo, Ned, and [[Officer Barbrady]], his nose is invisible. However, it can only be seen when his head is in profile view.

In ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", Jesus initially did not appear to have any special powers, simply tricking people with simple tricks, such as telling everyone to turn around, and then quickly replacing a jug of water with a jug of wine while their backs are turned. However, subsequently, in the same episode, he used his ""master carpentry skills"" to create a giant mold for the [[John Wilkes Booth]] statue, exhibiting superhuman work speeds. In ''[[The Spirit of Christmas#Jesus vs. Santa|The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Santa]]'', Jesus was also able to fire energy blasts from his hands.

His other power is that of resurrection; in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", he is killed multiple times and resurrects himself at will. This power is similar to Kenny's, but he is able to resurrect himself to any location he desires. Also in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", Jesus was able to heal Santa's broken legs, suggesting he has the ability to fix broken bones.

[[File:AreYouThereGodItsMeJesus084.png|thumb|Jesus with [[God]].]]
Jesus is the son of [[God]]. God is shown to be quite distant to Jesus because he usually has some plan to teach him. In ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"", Jesus asks God to appear before the people of Earth for the new millennium, but God refuses. However, Jesus later realizes that this was because God wanted to teach him that he should never let pride get in the way of his good judgment and that if God did everything for everyone, there would be no point in existence.

[[File:MrHankeysChristmasClassics064.png|thumb|Jesus performs a duet with [[Santa Claus]] in ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"".]]
Jesus has a special relationship with [[Santa Claus]] since they are both considered icons of Christmas time. Their relationship is often characterized by friction, but they usually reconcile in the end.

In ''[[The Spirit of Christmas#Jesus vs. Santa|The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Santa]]'', the pair fought in order to decide what Christmas was really about. However, they reconciled by the end of the short after [[Brian Boitano]] imparts his wisdom upon them.

They also sing a duet in ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"". However, partway through the performance, Santa gets upset because, ""There's, like, 300 Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones!"" However, they again reconcile by the end of their performance, and join each other in singing ""White Christmas"".

In ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", Jesus helps the boys on a high-risk mission to rescue Santa Claus from the Iraqis, who shot him down over their airspace and are torturing him. However, the rescue mission goes awry, and Jesus dies during the mission, sacrificing himself to save Santa. At the end of the episode, Santa dedicates Christmas to the memory of Jesus.

[[File:SoC-Jesus vs. Santa6.png|thumb|Jesus with [[The Boys|the boys]].]]
The boys, [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Kenny McCormick]], and [[Eric Cartman]], have met and cooperated with Jesus on numerous occasions. In ''[[The Spirit of Christmas#Jesus vs. Santa|The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Santa]]'', they help him find the mall and later tell both Jesus and Santa that the point of Christmas is to get along rather than fight.

In ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", Jesus joined the boys on the rescue mission to Iraq to save [[Santa Claus]]. Kyle killed Jesus in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", but only at the latter's behest, in order to escape from their imprisonment. Kyle was extremely reluctant, and after Jesus' violent death, he looked pretty traumatized.

[[File:SuperBestFriends073.png|left|thumb|Jesus with the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]].]]
Jesus is depicted as the leader of the ""Super Best Friends"" with several other religious figures, including [[Muhammad]], [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], [[Joseph Smith]], [[Lao Tse]], and [[Moses]] and also [[Seaman]] who is not a religious figure of any sort but is an ineffectual superhero that is the butt of jokes from the other heroes.

Jesus chose St. Peter, who is in fact a rabbit, to be the first Pope of Christianity because he knew no one man can lead a religion without becoming corrupt while rabbits are pure. So, he approved Peter's descendant, Snowball to be the new Pope.

Jesus appears in The ''Stick of Truth'' as a summonable character in battles. In order to use him, [[Priest Maxi]] sends you to find Jesus in the church, where he is hiding, and he tells you that finding him the next time ""won't be so easy"". The second time you find Jesus, he is hiding behind the podium and you have to turn off the lights and focus the spotlights on the podium, revealing his shadow. You then unlock him as a summon and get him and Priest Maxi as friends.

When summoned during battle, he flies down from the sky, fires two mags from an assault rifle, driving the enemies away, before putting on his shades and flying away.

Jewpacabra,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jewpacabra_(Character),,"is a creature made up by [[Eric Cartman]] said to prey on children during Passover, who plays a major role in the episode ""[[Jewpacabra]]"".

When people are signing up for the [[Easter Egg Hunt]], Cartman tells people about the Jewpacabra and how it preys on children during Passover, which just so happens to be the same time as Easter that year. [[Clyde Donovan]] then sees a dead bird, which he believes to have been killed by the Jewpacabra. Later Cartman and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] go to the forest to look for the creature, and tries calling it with it's anti-Christ mating calls, and they later catch a supposed video of the Jewpacabra, which they show to the business owners of [[Sooper Foods]]. Cartman shows the video to the [[Bigfoot Researchers]], who misguidedly confirm the video to be real, making Cartman believe that it's real. In order to lure the Jewpacabra, the Sooper Foods employees later kidnap Cartman, dress him up in a bunny suit, cover him with chicken blood, chain him to brick, and leave him for the Jewpacabra as a sacrifice. [[Kyle Broflovski]] eventually comes to the park, and he asks Cartman to admit that the Jewpacabra isn't real and he will set him free, to which Cartman doesn't admit. Kyle later comes back to Cartman sleeping in the woods, covering him with a blanket and bringing him back to [[Cartman Residence|his house]]. In the morning, Cartman returns to the Easter Egg hunt, telling the crowd how a ""Passover miracle"" happened, believing it was the Jewpacabra that brought him back to his house, causing the crowd to dislike him.

Although the Jewpacabra is never shown, the supposed sighting of it appears to be a dog mistaken for the creature.

[[File:MexicanStaringFrog32.png|200px|thumb|Jimbo riding a horse during the Vietnam War.]]
Jimbo was a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War where he met his lifelong buddy, [[Ned Gerblanski]]. However, his memory of the events are heavily distorted. When he relates his memories to [[The Boys|the boys]] for their history assignment, he recalls that there were amusement park rides and that he and Ned defeated the entire Viet Cong by themselves, while on horseback.

Mr. Garrison does not believe the boys' story, thinking that they made it up, and gives them detention. Mr. Garrison also hints that he was in Vietnam himself. However, a cameraman who was also a Vietnam veteran appeared to share memories of amusement park rides as well, implying that Jimbo's story was either true or that the cameraman shared Jimbo and Ned's delusion.

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]],'' and ""[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]"", Jimbo is also shown to be known for his guerrilla tactics.

Jimbo is best known for being a hunter. Most of his episodes circle around him hunting with his ever-present companion, [[Ned Gerblansky]]. Jimbo is often shown carrying a rifle.

In ""[[Volcano]]"", Jimbo revealed that because there was a law issued, which forbade the killing of an animal unless in self-defense, he and Ned would always say, ""It's coming right for us!"" before killing an animal. However, in the episode, ""[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]"", it was revealed that hunters were no longer allowed to exploit this loophole. Instead, he would say, ""We need to kill them to thin out their numbers"", under the pretense that they were culling animals in order to prevent overpopulation.

Jimbo also runs the local gun shop. This was first shown in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", when he sold Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat a gun to shoot Kathie Lee Gifford with.

[[File:MexicanStaringFrog3.png|200px|thumb|Jimbo and Ned hosting a hunting show in ""[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]"".]]
Jimbo and Ned also co-host a TV show called ''[[Huntin' and Killin']]''. It is first featured in ""[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]"", in which Jimbo and Ned get into a ratings war against ''Jesus and Pals''. ''Huntin' and Killin'' pulled in about twenty-four viewers, beating ''Jesus and Pals'' by about two viewers.

The show has not been mentioned since that episode, but one of its episodes can be heard on Cartman's TV in the episode ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"".

[[File:CartmansMomIsStillADirtySlut75.png|thumb|200px|Jimbo, [[Ned]], and [[Mayor McDaniels]] eating human flesh.]]
In the episode ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" he and Ned, the [[Mayor McDaniels|mayor]], [[Officer Barbrady]], [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] and [[Mr. Hat]], the film producer, his assistant, and actor [[Eric Roberts]] all got snowbound. After a while, they got hungry, and Jimbo said they would have to eat each other since there was no other food available. They started with Eric Roberts, and eventually ate the film producer and his assistant. Curiously, this does not seem to have affected Jimbo or Ned, and they have simply moved on with their lives.

Jimbo's sexual orientation remains ambiguous. Jimbo has never been married, and his only companion is his lifelong partner [[Ned Gerblansky]], who in ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"" is shown walking around Jimbo's house wearing skimpy underpants and an open short red dressing gown, which Jimbo seems entirely comfortable with. In the [[Season Five]] premiere ""[[It Hits the Fan]]"", Jimbo is able to say ""fag"" without being censored, heavily implying that he is gay. In ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"" he admits that ""everyone is a little gay.""

However, in the episode ""[[Goobacks]]"", he is reluctant to participate in a gay orgy in order to prevent the people of the future from ever existing. In ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", it is revealed that he had sexual relations with [[Liane Cartman]] (but so did Mr. Garrison). In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", he is caught in the metrosexual craze, and explains to Mr. Garrison that he is not gay. In the episode ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", he and Ned got excited when Mrs. Tenorman was taking off her bra.

The confusion surrounding Jimbo's sexuality may be a reflection of his own confusion; he identifies with a very stereotypically heterosexual and macho culture, which he may find hard to reconcile with his homo/bisexuality.

In ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"", Jimbo falls gravely ill from [[COVID-19]]. It is mentioned that he has alcoholism when Randy says his obesity and alcoholism would have made him very ill anyway. Randy attempts to cure him by giving marijuana contaminated with his semen. He gets better and [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] brings him back to [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]]. However, he soon grows a mustache after smoking the marijuana and falls ill again. However, in ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", he is seen to have fully recovered.

He wears an orange hat, orange shirt, green vest, and brown trousers. Underneath his hat he is nearly bald, but what little hair he has is light brown. He is overweight and has a double chin. His jawline is very broad and square.

Jimbo was given an updated look in the episode ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]""; his jacket was shaded around the edges of the pockets. In the episode, ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", Jimbo shaved his head; however, it is likely his hair has since grown back, since the ""metrosexual"" fad faded near the end of the aforementioned episode.

Jimbo, along with [[Ned]], [[Chef]], and [[Skeeter's Friends]] are the only adult characters on the show that have black rectangular eyebrows. He is also one of the few adults who does not have a nose.

He somewhat resembles Looney Tunes character Elmer Fudd.

Although Jimbo generally seems amiable, he occasionally has streaks of madness, such as when he saw Kenny McCormick as a platypus in ""[[Damien]]"". Though the platypus stood on two legs, was dressed like Kenny, and was indoors with the other children, he shot him immediately.

He tried to kill him again in ""[[Cripple Fight]]"". Timmy had given Jimmy Valmer an orange parka to make him look like Kenny, in hopes that this would kill him. One of the obstacles he narrowly escaped was Jimbo, who says ""Look! There's Kenny! Get him!"" and fires, before taking a closer look and saying ""Oh wait, that's not him!"".

He also directed the other men in South Park on how to bully [[Mr. Cotswolds]] in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"". He likes the idea of being Stan's ""cool uncle"". He took him hunting, openly swears in front of him and the boys, and offers them alcohol in ""[[Volcano]]"".

Although he has good technical knowledge, having been a pilot and being able to operate many different weapons, he is frequently shown to be quite dimwitted; for example, being unable to tell the difference between Cartman and [[Scuzzlebutt]] in ""[[Volcano]]"", thinking that a plastic frog was a deadly animal ""[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]"", thus causing Ned to go into a coma, and repeatedly forgetting to lie to checkpoint controllers when smuggling in Mexican fireworks ""[[Summer Sucks]]"".

Stan is Jimbo's nephew. He cares for his nephew, but he gets frustrated by Stan's animal-loving nature. In ""[[Volcano]]"", Jimbo seemed to give up on Stan because he refused to shoot anything. All the same, at the end of the episode when Stan shot the Scuzzlebutt, Jimbo still got upset and explained that one should not shoot just anything, especially not when it just saved your life. He then tells Stan that he'll always be his nephew, and he'll always love him, even if he is a sissy.

She is Jimbo's niece. They have never interacted onscreen. Nothing is known about their relationship.

He is Jimbo's brother-in-law. They appear to have a decently friendly relationship, often drinking together and talking about their interests. 

She is Jimbo's sister. They do not interact much, but when they do, they seem to be on good terms. In ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"", she seemed to care a lot for Jimbo while he was battling COVID-19.

[[File:Volcano087.png|200px|thumb|Jimbo and Ned in ""[[Volcano]]"".]]
Jimbo and Ned met while deployed in Vietnam. They soon formed a solid friendship, and are almost always seen together. They share each other's enthusiasm for firearms and hunting. It is not known if their relationship is entirely platonic, as they both live together and neither are married (although Ned used to have a wife). Ned is also seen walking around immodestly dressed in Jimbo's house in ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"". In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', they work together to fight.

Jimbo takes [[The Boys|the boys]] on a hunting trip in ""[[Volcano]]"". He warms especially to Kenny, whom he makes his honorary nephew. He usually tries to be helpful towards the boys in later episodes. He tends to get along with Cartman as well. However, in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", he becomes annoyed when the boys throw a rock at his truck.

As of ""[[Volcano]]"", he became Jimbo's honorary nephew due to the fact that he enjoyed hunting animals and shooting or bombing them as he did. However, shortly thereafter, Ned accidentally shot Kenny dead. He also enjoyed guzzling down alcohol and gasoline.

However, in later episodes, Jimbo has (sometimes successfully) attempted to kill Kenny on several occasions. In ""[[Damien]]"", he sees Kenny in the form of a duck-billed platypus and immediately opens fire on him. In ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", Jimbo shouts, ""There he is, shoot him!"" when he sees [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] in the orange parka Kenny always wears. Exactly why Jimbo attempted to kill Kenny in this instance is not known.

In ""[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]"" Jimbo almost shot a runaway [[Gobbles]], who at the time belonged to Timmy. Timmy came to Gobbles' rescue just as Jimbo was about to shoot him and jumped in his way, causing Timmy to take the bullet instead. Luckily, Timmy was left merely wounded, and to make it up to him, Jimbo went with Timmy to the fourth graders' Thanksgiving play to shoot the turkey that replaced Gobbles.

Jimbo plays a major role in the game ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' alongside [[Ned Gerblansky]], hunting out at [[Stark's Pond]] when it is attacked by [[Jakovasaur]]s and other enemies. He and his partner both function as powered-up 'fiery-works' towers, but without costing the player any money. Neither character is playable, however, and it is unknown if the game is canon.

Jimbo has his store in the northwest corner of South Park, right next to [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails|Skeeter's bar]]. In addition to selling the player a number of high-level weapons, he also gives the player [[Big Game Huntin' With Jimbo|a quest]] to hunt down a bunch of rare wild creatures for rewards.

In the [[Peppermint Hippo Lost & Found]] mission, Jimbo reveals that he had left his wallet back in [[The Peppermint Hippo]]. Retrieving it and coming back to him will unlock the Ham Radio (the summon) and the ability to take a selfie with him.

Jimbo's role is one of those which has diminished greatly since the beginning. In the first several seasons, he had an average of three or four prominent roles per season. Around the seventh season and onward, his importance faded to the point at which he now gets to have about 1 or two prominent appearances each season. He made a temporary comeback in Season 10, though, when his level of prominence equaled three episodes once more.

*'''Drug use''' - In ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", Jimmy took steroids. While this was under the manipulation of [[Nathan]], Jimmy could have declined, so this will also be held on Nathan's criminal record as well as Jimmy's.
*'''Gang warfare''' - In ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"", Jimmy and Timmy become members of the [[Crips (Gang)|Crips]] and are heavily involved with their gang operations, including an unintentional robbery at [[City Wok]] and the war with the Bloods.
*'''Damage to property or vandalism '''- In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", he, along with [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Stan Marsh]], [[Butters Stotch]], [[Tolkien Black]], [[Craig Tucker]], and [[Clyde Donovan]], smashed [[Eric Cartman]]'s electronics due to them thinking that Cartman is [[Skankhunt42]].

Like Timmy, the humor of Jimmy's character comes from his endless optimism despite his handicap. His disability is not overtly mocked; rather his exaggerated eagerness to be a successful ""handi-capable"" person. Jimmy's role has more recently been expanded, bringing him more screen time and giving his character more depth. In ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", he is one of the final 10 chosen to be their fourth member, but ultimately he is not picked. In later seasons, he is shown hanging with [[Craig's Gang]].

He is generally popular and successful at school; he is moral and knows how to be a friend. However, he is foul-mouthed and very competitive; he took steroids just to win the [[Up the Down Steroid|Special Olympics]]. He and Timmy also competed against [[Christopher Reeve]] in ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"".

Despite being foul-mouthed and competitive, he is generally well-liked and nice always looking after his friends.

[[File:107.jpg|thumb|Jimmy hosting the First Annual Comedy Awards.]]
He likes to perform stand-up comedy in the style of [[Jay Leno]] (often starting jokes with ""Have you seen this?"" or ""Have you heard about this?""), but he is often criticized for his jokes, although everyone considered them hilarious in ""[[Cripple Fight]]"". When finishing a joke, even if only one person was listening to him, and no matter what their reaction to the joke, he will usually say ""Wow, what a great audience!"".

In ""[[Fishsticks]]"", one of his jokes became world-famous and was considered to be the greatest joke in the world by everyone except [[Kanye West]].

Jimmy also likes to sing. In ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", he sang ""[[The Twelve Days of Christmas]]"" painfully slowly with a stutter in front of an unaware, tired audience at [[City Hall]]. He also sings and plays the ukulele to ""[[Tardicaca Hula Gal]]"" in ""[[Crippled Summer]]"" though he struggles to play parts of his ukulele solo.

In ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"" Jimmy is shown to have the ability to play the drums as seen when he does a drum-roll for Cartman to jump over a homeless guy with his skateboard. In ""[[Band in China]]"", the full extent of his proficiency is demonstrated. He plays extremely fast and complicated drum beats in Stan's death metal band [[Crimson Dawn]].

Jimmy seems to be good at fighting. In ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", he and Timmy engage in a fistfight that is, shot-for-shot, nearly identical to the fistfight scene in the John Carpenter 1980's science fiction film ''They Live''. Timmy and Jimmy become friends in subsequent episodes. Jimmy seems to be the only one who can understand Timmy's limited speech.

Jimmy was using steroids in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", and was shown developing drug-induced 'roid rage"", beating up his girlfriend and threatening to kick Cartman's ass. He often uses his crutches as a weapon when fighting, as demonstrated in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"". Jimmy was seen fighting with the Fifth Graders during the protest in ""[[1%]]"".

However, in ""[[Casa Bonita]]"", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] can easily subdue Jimmy, smashing him against the lockers, but this could be attributed to the fact that it was a surprise attack. Also, in ""[[Truth and Advertising]]"", [[Leslie Meyers]] manages to beat him up, although this can also be counted as a surprise attack.

Jimmy's last name was uncertain; he was known as Jimmy Swanson in ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"", but his name was changed to ""Valmer"" in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"" and all subsequent episodes. This was possibly referenced in ""[[Tsst]]"" when Cartman told him they were best friends, Jimmy asked him ""What's my last name?"", a question Cartman could not answer.

The [[South Park Studios]] FAQ states that the names of many ''South Park'' characters, including Jimmy, have changed because of the show's fast-paced production, which results in the original name occasionally being forgotten and replaced with a new one.

Despite being well-liked and generally nice, Jimmy does have a criminal record. These crimes include:

Jimmy might have had sex twice, but he has at least had sex once. The first time was with Jimmy's girlfriend (who is unknown). It might have been a lie but nobody knows for sure. The second time was with a prostitute nicknamed [[Nut Gobbler]], the reason Jimmy had sex with her was that he kept getting erections and Butters told him the only way to get rid of the erection was to have sex.

In ""[[Erection Day]]"", Jimmy was afraid that he would get an erection at a school talent show so he went to Colfax Point where he picked up a prostitute nicknamed [[Nut Gobbler]] and had sex with her.

In ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"", Jimmy, [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], [[Craig Tucker|Craig]], [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Eric]], and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] find marijuana and a lighter on a tree stub. They were going to throw away the drugs. But none of [[the boys]] (except for Stan) wanted to throw it away. Stan said quote ""You guys those commercials are just exaggerations"". Tolkien replies ""How do you know? None of us have had any drugs before"". But then Jimmy said, ""Well, I did ecstasy once. Me and my girlfriend took it, and we stayed up all night having s-s-sex"". Nobody knows if he was lying or telling the truth. But after saying that he had sex he was asked where he had sex with her. Jimmy replied with a joke ""In her v-v-vagina"". The ""In her vagina joke"" was confirmed as a joke because he smiled while saying it and after Jimmy told the joke he said, ""Wow, what a terrific audience"".

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he becomes a stand-up ""woke"" comedian who stars in his own late-night show, complimenting people of diverse groups instead of making jokes about them. However, this was no longer the case in an alternate future shown at the end of ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', where Jimmy begins making jokes about ""bisexual Canadians"". Aside, he no longer stammers frequently.

Jimmy wears a yellow long-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, and black boots. He has brown hair with sideburns. He also wears braces and has a rather lopsided face, as well as exotropia. This is observed by the fact that his eyes never move in their sockets. Like [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]], he is disabled; he has ataxic cerebral palsy, along with equinus (tiptoe gait)[[File:Epi901img13.jpg|thumb|right|Jimmy's parents [[Ryan Valmer|Ryan]] and [[Sarah Valmer]]]]
[[Ryan Valmer|Ryan]] and [[Sarah Valmer]], Jimmy's dad, and mom believe that [[God]] sent them a handicapped son to punish them for teasing handicapped people when they were in high school together.

When Jimmy started getting erections in ""[[Erection Day]]"", his parents hired a counselor called [[Dr. Pal]] to convince Jimmy that these spontaneous erections were a normal phase and nothing to worry about.

In ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"", Ryan is portrayed as the Chief of the Fire Department.

Jimmy is generally portrayed as a well-liked character in the boys' circle of friends; he has never been hatefully singled out in the school or bitterly discriminated against.

Timmy and Jimmy are frequently seen together; they'll often be in the same situation and have the same goals and will work together to achieve them. Jimmy is the dominant voice and decision-maker in the friendship, being the one who can speak.

Jimmy first entered the show in ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", where Timmy was jealous that Jimmy got attention and adoration as the ""handicapped kid"", a reputation that was originally his.

Timmy presumably ended his jealousy soon afterward; he is friendly and loyal to Jimmy in every following episode in which they're together. They often work together and look out for one another, as seen in subsequent episodes such as ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"" and ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"".

Jimmy appears to be much more permissive and accepting of Cartman than most others. He is also the only character other than Butters (and most adults) to usually refer to him by his first name Eric, suggesting that Jimmy does not dislike or disrespect him. Jimmy and Butters were also the only students who attended Cartman's AIDS benefit in ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"". However, he has also expressed some dislike of Cartman and has rejected him as a friend, as seen in ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", where Jimmy agrees to ignore him. He even joins the boys to smash Cartman's electronics when he was blamed for being the internet troll.

Based on the one-on-one interactions Butters and Jimmy have had on the show, they seem to be good friends. In ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"", Butters was the only person who went to see Jimmy's comedy show instead of [[Christopher Reeve]]'s public appearance. In ""[[Erection Day]]"", Jimmy came to Butters for advice on his erection problems, expressing that Butters is the only one he can tell who would not make fun of him for it. The two were also seen sitting together at Cartman's AIDS benefit in ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"". During Season Fifteen's episode ""[[1%]]"" Jimmy and Butters form the 99% club to protest the Presidential Fitness Test results. They stand outside and picket the [[President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition]], Colorado Division Regional Office, only the media believe they are protesting the Red Robin Restaurant. In ""[[Funnybot]]"", Butters is the only person in the audience who was clapping and cheering Jimmy while everybody else was asleep. In ""[[Going Native]]"", Butters reveals that he does not find Jimmy's jokes funny. In ""[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]"", the two are seen trick-or-treating together.

In ""[[Fishsticks]]"", Craig is shown to have some concern for Jimmy, giving him advice over what he should do about Cartman taking credit for his jokes, telling him, ""I like you, Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half"".

Jimmy is often seen as a part of [[Craig Tucker|Craig's]] gang, notably in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"" and ""[[Ginger Kids]]"". He is the most frequent fourth member of the group.

Jimmy often hangs out with the boys, often filling the place of the fifth member.

Although Jimmy is part of [[Craig's Gang|Craig's group]] of friends in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", he is shown trying hard to get into the boys' group in ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", even bribing them with a basket of gifts and begging to be chosen.

[[File:Nancy.png|thumb|Nancy]]In ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", Jimmy had a girlfriend named [[Nancy]], whom he'd met in free period at school the previous week. He beat her up in a testosterone rush after consuming steroids and also accused her of cheating on him. He also beat up his mother when she came to defend Nancy. But Nancy still rooted for him at the Special Olympics, so it seemed like she forgave him.

[[File:Epi907img08.jpg|left|thumb|Jimmy and [[Nut Gobbler]] in the streets]]
In ""[[Erection Day]]"", Jimmy started getting erections, and to stop them in time for the talent show, he had sex with a prostitute who went by the street name Nut Gobbler, after approaching a classmate named [[Red|Rebecca]] for sex and getting slapped and called a jerk.

Jimmy asks Red if she'll have sex with him in ""[[Erection Day]]"". So from this, we can conclude Jimmy had a crush on Red. When he first greeted her she responded enthusiastically and smiled. Although any further feelings for him may be dead since she was not very happy after he asked to have sex with her.

Nathan is shown to have a strong hatred of Jimmy. In [[Up the Down Steroid|his first appearance]], he sells Jimmy some steroids, which makes him aggressive and beat up [[Nancy|his girlfriend]] and [[Sarah Valmer|mother]]. In [[Crippled Summer]], Nathan tries to kill him as he is sick of losing to him. In [[PC Principal Final Justice]], he holds Jimmy hostage in his house.

In [[Sponsored Content]], Jimmy is sent to work out Leslie's plan. He falls for Leslie's trap and helps her escape from the [[Newsmen]]. When they get to Nathan's house, Leslie beats Jimmy up.

Jimmy plays a small role in the game's storyline and comes out at the end of the ""Hell's Pass Hospital"" level to inform the player that [[Jimbo Kern]] and [[Ned Gerblansky]] are in trouble at [[Stark's Pond]], setting the stage for the next level.

Jimmy is the first character outside of the main five to make a prominent appearance.

In gameplay, he is of the same class as [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], doing average damage, speed, and range, and his special ability involves using his crutches to create a small tornado and killing all enemies that he touches.

:''For more information about this section please see [[The Bard (Character)|The Bard]].''
Jimmy plays an important role in ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'', serving as a boss, and later, as a buddy and playable character. His class is Level 10 Bard. In several cutscenes, he stutters badly, and it will continue doing so for a long time, but can be skipped if the player holds down a certain button (or just chooses to wait it out).

Jimmy started as a would-be one-off character but was reworked into an occasional gag character. He eventually became a regular supporting character and arguably the most prominent of the secondary children, receiving episodes focusing on him on a fairly regular basis.

Jimmy's Assistant,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jimmy%27s_Assistant,,"is an assistant for [[Jimmy Valmer]]'s late night show. She appears in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]''.

During a commercial break on Jimmy's late night show, an assistant informs him that their corporate is requesting Jimmy to cut one of his jokes about hummus, much to his annoyance. Jimmy then seeks his assistant's help to screen through the latest news for ideas, but becomes shocked when he finds out about [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] death. As Jimmy attempts to leave for [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], the assistant tries to stop him, reminding him that the First Lady is scheduled to appear. Jimmy brushes it off however, asking the assistant to send his compliments to the First Lady, before leaving anyway.

The assistant wears a gray jacket over a black turtleneck shirt and a dark gray skirt. She carries a clipboard, a white earphone, and an ID card with yellow lanyard.

Jo Frost,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Jo_Frost,,"is a professional nanny and host of the program ''Supernanny''. She appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode, ""[[Tsst]]"".

In ""[[Tsst]]"", after [[Stella Reid]] failed to cure [[Eric Cartman]], [[Liane Cartman]] hired Nanny Frost to help her control her son Eric's behavior. She was initially confident, declaring, ""There's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time, you're going to see a new Eric Cartman!"" but she too failed.

Three days hence, Frost was institutionalized at [[Slater-Carey Mental Hospital]], where she now spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. Between mouthfuls of defecate, she screams that Cartman comes from [[hell]].

She appears in a purple cardigan and dress and wears rectangular glasses. She appears slightly overweight and has a mole on her left cheek. She is also at one point seen with a parasol patterned with the colors of the Union Jack. Like many British characters, she is shown to have bad teeth.

After being institutionalized, she is seen in a white mental patient's uniform, with messed up hair and covered in her own feces.

Job,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Job,,"is a Biblical character mentioned in the [[Hebrews]]' ""Literature of Wisdom"" corpus of the Bible. Most scholars believe he is a fictional character created to teach the readers about morals. Job lived in the Ancient Near East and is shown in a flashback in ""[[Cartmanland]]"".

[[Kyle Broflovski]] pops his hemorrhoid on the barbed wire fence while waiting in line in [[North Park Funland]] which was bought by [[Eric Cartman]], infecting the sore and almost killing him. He is taken to [[Hells Pass Hospital]] where he denounces his faith completely, and [[Gerald Broflovski|his]] [[Sheila Broflovski|parents]]' description of the trials of Job who suffered despite being a good person does little to assure him, only resulting in him believing God is even worse.

His short-tempered wife, Pip's grown sister, is dismissive towards him and his work, often being obnoxious and abusive towards him as well as disparagingly calling him things like ""metal-pounding fairy"".

The Marshes invite the new family to dinner, where Teresa displays her bad temper and attitude, gossiping about the people in South Park and insulting [[Sharon Marsh]]. When Sharon smartly retorts her, she becomes furious and flips the table, swearing heavily. Every time Teresa becomes angry, her husband Joe tries to calm her down.

This draws the ire of his colleagues, including Frank who points out the office door clearing showing a sign that pajamas are required to be worn in the office.

After the school declares an ""Opposite Day"" instead of Pajama Day, the news was spread to the office, with Frank instructing everyone to return to their usual working attire, believing that wearing pajamas on ""Opposite Day"" would make the workers look like ""douchebags"" like Mike.

Following the influx of city dwellers in ""[[City People]]"", Frank (now known as John Aspinal) recruits [[Liane Cartman]] into the South Park Realtors, and faces competition from the [[South Park Realty Group]] formed by [[Eric Cartman]].

John Edward,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/John_Edward,,"known professionally as '''John Edward''', is a TV psychic medium and host of ''Crossing Over''. He first appears in the [[Season Six]] episode ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"".

When Cartman's body begins to fail due to having Kenny's soul trapped inside him, [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]] takes him, [[Liane Cartman]], [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]] to New York, in hopes that John Edward's ability to talk to the dead will help get Kenny out of Cartman's body.

Unfortunately, everyone except Kyle quickly realizes that his 'gifts' are nothing more than a parlor trick. Kyle however comes to the belief that Edward spoke to his grandmother, causing him to freak out and join a special school for Jewish kids in New York.

Wanting to get Kyle to snap out of his fear, Stan visits Edwards in hopes that he will tell Kyle the truth about his 'powers' being a trick, and thus return home to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. Edward however refuses to admit that he is a fake, prompting Stan to call him a douche and then nominate him for ""Biggest Douche in the Universe"". Edward freaks out, runs to his panic room to call the police, during which Stan steals several of his books that teach how to fake being a psychic. Stan attempts to use the same tricks Edward used to convince Kyle of the truth.

Unfortunately, everyone comes to believe that Stan really is psychic and is given his own television show, during which Stan tells his audience exactly how he does the tricks, reminded them constantly that is not real and that Edward is a fake. However, the audience is too stupid and blinded to understand that he is not psychic.

Edward then locates Stan, and challenges him to a psychic showdown, because Stan's show is doing better and because Stan continues to say he's a fake. Stan accepts, but at the showdown, tells the audience that he understands their desires to believe in Edward and are comforted by the idea that their deceased family members are speaking through him, but that in the end it was still just a trick and that their family and friends have better things to do in the afterlife than talking to Edward.
[[File:TheBiggestDoucheintheUniverse153.png|thumb|John Edward being awarded the Biggest Douche in the Universe award.]]
Furious, Edward screams that he really is psychic and special, when all of a sudden an alien ship lands. Several aliens step off, and excitedly greet Edward, informing him that Stan's nomination for ""Biggest Douche in the Universe"" was accepted and that he was to go to the awards ceremony. Edward, screams ""I'm not a Douche!"" as he gets dragged onto the ship against his will.

He also appears in ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"", but does not speak.

He also  threatens to sue Stan for slander, but does not follow up on this threat.

Kanye West,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kanye_West,,"Kanye does not understand the [[Fishsticks Joke]] and thinks that people are actually referring to him personally as a gay fish. He resorts to violent rages every-time someone attempts to explain the joke. He punches out a TV presenter and leaves the stage during a performance. When [[Carlos Mencia]] claims credit for writing the joke on the [[Conan O'Brien]] show, he kidnaps and murders the comedian while trying to get him to explain the meaning. Finding out [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Jimmy Valmer]] wrote the joke during their appearance on the [[Ellen DeGeneres]] talk show.

Kanye and his entourage hold Cartman and Jimmy hostage at Jimmy's house threatening to murder them if they do not tell him the reason for calling him a ""gay fish"". Jimmy and Cartman ignore the threats and fight about who wrote the joke, Kanye comes to the wrong conclusion and accepts that he is a literal ""[[Gay Fish]]"", mistaking the argument as if they were talking about him. At this point, a music video shows him diving into the sea where he begins humping and French-kissing other fish and sea animals.

Kanye returned in ""[[200]]"", still in his ""gay fish"" attire, to take part in the lawsuit against [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] with all of the other celebrities.

In ""[[The Hobbit]]"", Kanye constantly tries to convince naysayers that his fiancée, [[Kardashians|Kim Kardashian]], is not a hobbit. However, he repeatedly calls her to clarify certain issues as her similarities to a hobbit become ever more apparent. He sings the song ""[[My Bitch Ain't No Hobbit]]"".

West makes a cameo on a poster in ""[[REHASH]]"".

In a deleted scene from ""[[Fishsticks]]"", the U.S. Coast Guard finds his drowned, bloated corpse in the ocean, revealing that Kanye's undersea sexual encounters were nothing more than hallucinations.

Kanye West is an African American with close-cropped black hair and a dark skin tone.

In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', he is depicted as a literal fish with shiny green scales. He still wears his signature golden chain.

In ""[[Fishsticks]]"", he is egotistical, narcissistic, and self-absorbed. He is also unintelligent, not being able to understand something as simple as the Fishsticks joke, believing people see him as a homosexual fish.

The karate instructor wears a traditional karate outfit, consisting of a white gi with a red-fist logo and a black belt. He has a black mustache and black hair He also has stereotypical characteristics of Asians seen in the series such as small eyes.

The instructor is shown to be strict, pointing out his pupil's aberrant lack of discipline. He is dedicated to his craft, saying that true discipline comes from within.

Karen McCormick,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Karen_McCormick,,"is the youngest member of the McCormick family. She first appears as a background character in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"". She later appeared in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", where she played her first major role. [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] is very protective of her, using his identity, [[Mysterion]], to comfort her in hard times and keep her out of danger. Kenny's protectiveness as Mysterion extends to such a degree that she considers him her ""guardian angel"".

Karen always wears a green jacket with a velvet collar, dark blue pants and black shoes, and rarely wears velvet mittens. In her first appearance, she has dirt over much of her face and her clothes, and her hair is slightly messier. By her second appearance, she is clean besides dirt over her left eye with her jacket having no scrapes or tears. For pajamas, she wears a pink-collared light blue shirt with pink and purple hearts and pink bottoms, or a magenta-collared pink onesie with magenta flowers all soiled.

In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", her appearance has been slightly upgraded with her hair now tied back with purple bows in pigtails and her face and jacket being messy again. Her [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]-like hair was possibly used as a Placeholder hairstyle for animation testing.

In ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'', after becoming a vampire, her pig-tailed hair is styled differently (similar to the Emo Ponies hairstyle found in-game) and colored black with dark purple accents. She wears a black top with peaked illusional sleeves, an image of a skull and crossbones on it, as well as magenta pants, an o-ring necklace, a punk spiked bracelet and fingerless gloves. Her face still looks dirty as with her original form in the main game, despite her skin color being darker, though it is accented with purple eyeshadow makeup.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Karen appears as an adult woman. She wears a buttoned up shirt with a similar green and velvet color scheme, and has a pixie cut with a velvet-colored bow. Karen also notably wears a necklace with [[Mysterion]]'s question mark symbol.
Karen seems to be relatively quiet and timid, thus indicating shyness. She is often seen with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], as she trusts him to be right next to her. She is usually seen crying when dealing with stressful situations. When Mysterion is around, Karen seems to feel safer and calm, since she does refer to him as her 'Guardian Angel'. 

Sometimes, Karen carries her pink princess doll around with her, or mostly stays around either her brothers or her mom. It seems that Karen is lonely all the time and that she has very few friends, including [[Kevin McCormick|Kevin]] and Kenny. When Kenny buys her a new doll in ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", the first thing she does is start talking to it, possibly for social reasons. She also seems to be naïve as to what might harm her or anyone, as shown in ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"", where she brings a used syringe previously owned by homeless people back into her house.

[[File:ThePoorKid058.png|thumb|200px|Mysterion saving Karen after being bullied.]]
Kenny is Karen's older brother. She seems to have a real good relationship with him, especially with his alter-ego, [[Mysterion]], to such an extent she considers him her ""Guardian Angel"". She also seems to look to Kenny for protection and comfort when she is upset; this is shown when the McCormick siblings are in [[the Soft Room]] at the police station and Karen is clutching Kenny's arm hard. Kenny is extremely protective of her and loves her dearly, even though Kenny was scared of having a younger sibling.

Carol is Karen McCormick's mother. She really seems to love her mother, even after being through years of abuse likely due to her parents' fighting. She seems to go to her mother when she is scared, as shown in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"" when she's seen crying in her mother's arms when her family was fighting. When she and her siblings are in The Soft Room, she immediately asks if she can see her mother.

In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", she sits on her mother's lap during the gentrification meeting and sits close to her on their couch at home. When Karen asks her if they can eat at the [[SoDoSoPa]], Carol seems to be more patient with her than Stuart, who immediately yelled at her about how costly ice cream is.

Carol also started yelling about Karen's protection when she brought in a syringe from the homeless in ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"".

Stuart is Karen McCormick's father. They have not interacted much, so very little is known about their relationship. She seems to be scared and insecure of him, as shown in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"" when she cries when he and Kevin fight, and in ""[[The City Part of Town]]"" when she cowers and leaves the room after he yells at her.

However, it shows that Stuart does care about her, along with Kevin and Kenny, in ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"" when he argues with the police about how the homeless living outside of their house are scaring his kids.

Kevin is Karen's oldest brother. It is apparent that she isn't as close to Kevin as she is to Kenny, since they have never been shown interacting one-on-one and she cries when he and Stuart fight in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"". However, in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", she is seen hiding behind Kevin in the hospital. It is likely that she trusts Kevin. In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", it is shown that they share a bedroom. 

Karen can be found in the McCormick family residence watching TV. She says that [[Princess Kenny]] texted her about how cute [[Douchebag|New Kid]] is, and asks the New Kid to watch over her ""sister"" for her. She strangely never mentions [[Kevin McCormick|Kevin]] in the game.

In ''South Park: The Fractured But Whole'', Karen has been updated to her latest look. She is available in her bedroom on Day 3 onwards in-game, whereby The New Kid can take a selfie with her after returning her current doll, which can be found in the Soft Room inside [[Park County Police Station]].

[[File:Kenrietta2.png|200px|thumb|Henrietta offers Karen her cigarette holder so the latter can become goth.]]
Karen plays a major role in the ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'' DLC, with a new appearance. She is ""kidnapped"" by [[South Park Vampire Society|the Vamp Kids]] and brought to [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]], where she turns into a vampire during a birthday party. [[Mysterion]], [[Henrietta Biggle]] and The New Kid try to rescue her. Along the way, she is possessed by [[Michael Jackson|Corey Haim]], who was accidentally summoned by [[Mr. Adams]]. After he is defeated, she goes back to normal, and finally realizes how ""completely fucking lame Vamp Kids are"". Karen tells Mysterion she joined them because she's lonely and often sees Kenny off with his friends instead. Henrietta recommends her to become goth if she doesn't need friends, starting with smoking her cigar holder. This was later discontinued after Kenny sends a message on Instagram that he will play with her more, with Henrietta replying that playing with each other isn't goth.

Katherine and Katie Queef,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Katherine_and_Katie_Queef,,"are two [[Canada|Canadian]] comedic actresses and the wives of [[Terrance and Phillip]].

In ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", ''The Queef Sisters'' made its debut broadcast on the [[Canada Channel]], replacing ''Terrance and Phillip'' on the night of a much-anticipated episode. Their show was designed in a similar fashion to Terrance and Phillip's farting humor; however, their comedy revolved around queefing. Men universally loathed the show, finding the humor to be disgusting and childish (ironic, considering their love of fart humor), while women praised the show, particularly because it bothered the men so much.

In the aforementioned episode of show, they are seen as the girls' doctor calls them for a checkup and the doctor tries to check for cysts, but every time he looks at their vaginas, the Queef sisters queef on his face. He gets very frustrated and tells the Queef sisters that he's not their doctor anymore, but the Queef sisters don't seem to care.

The girls grew up watching the Terrance and Phillip show, considering them to be their ""idols"", and having sexual fantasies. However, the success of their show negatively affected their heroes, whose own show was on the verge of cancellation. Furious, Terrance and Philip intended to murder the Queef Sisters for upstaging them. The girls were more than willing to accept death at the hands of their idols, which caused Terrance and Philip to reconsider. They each found one of the respective sisters attractive and began dating them. Unfortunately, they had many hurdles in their romances, such as not being able to tell each other apart. Another major issue was that the Queef Sisters loved to queef at any and all times, even while having sex. Terrance and Phillip however found the act disgusting like all the other men and even proceeded to slap the sisters.

The relationship seemed ready to end then and there, however both Terrance and Philip found themselves far too deeply in love with the sisters to give them up. And so, they proposed to the girls who accepted, and they had celebratory sex, all while farting and queefing. They were soon married, at which point they farted and queefed on the priest, and prepared for their new lives together.

The Queef Sisters are also considered to be feminist icons due to their female humor as well as their book, ''[[Eat, Pray, Queef (Book)|Eat, Pray, Queef]]''.

Both sisters have the standard Canadian flopping heads, beady eyes, and ""blocky"" appearance. Katherine has light brown hair and wears red lipstick. Katherine also wears an orange shirt with a black ""K"" at its center, and a light blue skirt. Katie has brown hair, a light brown shirt with a black ""K"" at its center, and a dark gray skirt.

Both sisters have similar personalities. In ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", they both loved to queef, idolized [[Terrance and Phillip]], and both were feminists. We can assume that they did not care about men's feelings, queefing on or near them, despite knowing how disgusting they found the act.

Katherine is married to Phillip, and Katie is married to Terrance. After a short falling out in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", they got back together and seem to be happily married.

As a child, Gifford was a classmate in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] class. When they were young, they competed in a talent show, in which Mr. Garrison and [[Mr. Hat]] put on a very lame, yet critically-praised ventriloquist performance. Victory seemed to be his until Kathie Lee came forth and sang, with background dancers, animals, and an orchestra; She won the talent show by a landslide. Mr. Garrison was furious, denying she had any real talent, believing the only reason she won was that ""she had choreography"", and has held a grudge against her ever since.

When Kathie Lee came to South Park as a special guest, Mr. Garrison, now a schoolteacher, decided to get even with her and lay off, but Mr. Hat suggested he should just kill her altogether. Mr. Garrison tried to fight Mr. Hat's influence, but gave in and purchased a rifle and held himself up in the town's book depository. Kathie showed up on a truck encased in a bulletproof glass chamber and surrounded by agents and viewed the various performances in town. While listening to [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]] singing [[Oh Kathie Lee|about her]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] has caught on to Mr. Garrison's plot and tried to convince him not to kill Kathie Lee. Unfortunately, he went forth with his plan and fired right at Kathie Lee while she was on stage, giving away the reward. However, she survived as she was thrown off when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] weight broke the stage, and Garrison shot [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] instead. Kathie Lee was rushed out of the town, Mr. Garrison was arrested, and Mr. Hat was committed to mental therapy.

Kathie Lee later made love to [[Chef]], as he was extremely attracted to her. He is shocked to find her even more sex-crazed than himself. She later reappears in a flashback during ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"" when the kids misremember her as being an alien in disguise and Garrison a hero.

She finally reappears in reality in a cameo in ""[[Wing]]"" near the stage at [[Sylvester Stallone|Sylvester Stallone's]] son's wedding.

She is later seen in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"", making a cameo at Chef's funeral, she sits next to [[Elton John]]. She makes two more appearances in ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"" as part of the class-action lawsuit but has no lines.

In ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", she wore a hot pink v-neck long sleeve shirt over a white blouse with purple pants. In ""[[The Return of Chef]]"", she wore a similar outfit, but her shirt was black instead of hot pink and her hair was redder. She also wore light pink eyeshadow instead of blue like in her previous appearances. Though, she still has red lipstick, light pink blush, and red hair, just as she had in all of her appearances.

In ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", she was shown to be self-centered and arrogant, as she loved the people of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] and children. She also appeared to be whorish, sleeping with Chef despite knowing him for less than a day.

Garrison and Gifford are rivals, as Garrison lost a talent show to Gifford as revealed in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"" and as a result, Garrison attempted murder against Gifford.

She slept with Chef in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", it is unknown if they had an actual relationship, however, given that Chef has since changed significantly, therefore, it is assumed any possible relationship is over. Kathie attended his funeral in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"".

She fell in love with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] in this episode, but she didn't want to get close to him since they live on the opposite sides of the country. She did get close to him, though and, as depicted in ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", their relationship continued to the point where Kenny was taking frequent bus trips to see her. Despite this, she never gets Kenny's name right due to his mumbled speech, referring to him with similar-sounding names such as ""Lenny"", ""Benny"", and various other incorrect names, even though she has heard his name before from other people, like Cartman and Stan.

She knows CPR, in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"", she saved Kenny from dying after he was struck by lightning, by giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Because of this act, Kelly should be noted as, arguably, the first character on the show to actually care about Kenny's death, she questions ""who"" [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] are talking about when they say ""''They killed Kenny,''"" and says they should do something to try and help him, the concept of which is utterly lost of Stan and Kyle. She also must have some talent singing and dancing, as she was a member of the ""[[Getting Gay With Kids]]"" choir.

She has blonde hair tied back in a ponytail, wears a blue sweater with green trim with a flower embroidered on one side, and dark blue pants. The band which ties her hair back is green.

In ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"", she seems to have issues with severing relationships, even, albeit temporarily, preventing herself from getting in a relationship with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. She also has a bad nose-picking habit. An act of clumsiness is shown when she trips after being chased. She is rather sweet, and is one of the few people to actually show concern for him when he dies. She even called Kyle and Stan out on their usual ""They killed Kenny"" catchphrase, asking who killed him. She does have a habit of saying his name wrong, though.

Kelly was Kenny's first girlfriend. Kelly originally didn't want to date Kenny, knowing that they would be away from each other after the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir leaves [[Costa Rica]]. She later decided that she would date Kenny, as long as they called each other every other day. Due to the events of ""[[The Ring]]"", it can be assumed that their relationship is over.

She seems to be a nice girl with enough time on her hands for a second job, and seems content being included in this company. She does not speak to Butters when he trains her, suggesting she may be shy or introverted.

At the end of [[The Bowels of the Beast]] and [[The Hundred Hands of Chaos]], Kelly-Ann is seen among the students walking out of school after dismissal.

She first appeared in the episode, ""[[Whale Whores]]"", where she witnessed a whale getting slaughtered by the Japanese at an aquarium in Baltimore.

She appeared in the episode, ""[[Funnybot]]"", where she was nominated for the ""Funniest Kid in School"" award. Ultimately, she, along with [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], lost to [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]].

She appeared in ""[[Faith Hilling]]"" as part of a group of children ""Taylor Swifting"" in front of [[Café Monet]].

She also appeared in ""[[Raising the Bar]]"", where she was seen in the background at [[Disneyland]].

She can be seen disgusted at Craig for ""breaking up"" with Tweek in ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"".

In her debut appearance, she was depicted with brown hair pulled into two pigtails secured by yellow bows, a pink shirt, and a pink skirt. Since ""[[Funnybot]]"", her hair bows and skirt changed to the color blue.

Considering she was nominated for ""Funniest Kid in School"", we can assume she is a very funny, or at least, a very humorous person. For example, she enjoys memeing as seen in ""[[Faith Hilling]]"".

She also appears to be somewhat socially anxious, as she finds conversing with people much easier on Facebook, as seen in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

Kelly appears outside Clyde's house and can be befriended. She explains how it is much easier and faster to have a conversation via Facebook than talking.

Kelly has blonde hair, put in two pigtails. She wears a pink jacket, purple pants, a yellow scarf with green stripes, and two pink-beaded hair ties. As a ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"", she wore a pink and black brassiere, a black tube top, a short, a blue skirt with white stars and a white line around it, black mascara, cyan eye shadow, two purple-beaded hair ties, and white shoes.

He later calls [[Harrison Yates]] who takes his persona as prostitute Yolanda too far and tells him he needs him as his ''Bottom Bitch''.

But when Harrison Yates wants to become Butter's ''bitch'' he appears in front of the [[Stotch Residence]] where he begs for ""Yolanda"" to come back to him, promising they will move to a [[Swiss Château|little château]] in [[Switzerland]]. At first, Yates refuses but when he proposes to him, he rushes and they make out on Butters' front lawn.

He is shown again in a remote château in the Swiss mountains. Inside he is shown on three photographs with Yates. He gives him a diamond necklace and tells him he wanted to give him something special, to which Yates replies: ''""Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love.

Kevin McCormick,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kevin_McCormick,,"is the eldest child of [[Stuart McCormick|Stuart]] and [[Carol McCormick]]. He is [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and [[Karen McCormick|Karen]]'s oldest sibling.

He never appears without the rest of his family or Kenny, and very little is known about him. He only has a speaking role in three episodes: ""[[Chickenlover]]"", ""[[Chickenpox]]"", and ""[[The Poor Kid]]"". He is often seen in the background with his brother or his family, usually at church or at Kenny's numerous funerals.

</gallery>

Kevin has wild, messy light brown hair, with a bandage, scratch, dirt, and leaves on his face. Occasionally, his design changes inconsistently to where he has three shadowy patches on his face, which may either be bruises or dirt. He wears gray pants and a red button-up shirt and has a set of braces. For formal occasions, as seen in ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"", he wears a light blue suit with a green tie with his hair combed back neatly. However, in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"" he wears a black suit with dark blue tie for Kenny's funeral.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Kevin is seen as an adult man. Compared to his siblings, he has visibly aged the most. His hair is now greyed, there is a scar where his band-aid used to be, and his face has the green splotches he had in his design from early seasons. He now wears a stained red shirt similar to the one he wore during childhood. However, the sleeves are ripped off, and he is wearing a Colorado Avalanche sweater underneath. Kevin has noticeably also gained weight. 

Kevin appears to be either slow, mentally handicapped, or a heavy drinker, as he speaks in a slow, repetitive slur when talking normally. Evidence of the latter is seen in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", where his [[Carol McCormick|mother]] calls him and his [[Stuart McCormick|father]] ""drunk pieces of shit"". However, he talks much more quickly and clearly when yelling and has a different voice in ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''. Kevin seems to have some boisterous and violent tendencies, as shown when he joyfully laughs when his father is beaten up by his mother and Cartman in ""[[Chickenlover]]"" and when he attempts to strangle his father, initiating a fight. His aggressively exuberant behavior is shown again in his lines as [[Infiltrator Kevin]], as he mimicks weapon noises when attacking and curses at the enemy player when attacked or defeated. However, Kevin has a bit more of a sarcastic side in ''Phone Destroyer'', as he will remark with either surprise or exclaim that Sci-Fi sucks when defeated and calls Stuart's alias as [[Sizzler Stuart]], ""pretty lame."" Kevin does not talk much; throughout the series, his voice has only been heard three times and he is usually quiet. 

In addition, Kevin repeated a CPS's officer order to take a seat in a police car in a slurred tone. The reason for this is unknown, although a possibility is that it was some sort of defensive mechanism that Kevin uses.

Kevin also has a fixation with waffles, as he excitedly announces when his waffle has finished being toasted in ""[[Chickenpox]]"", orders the player to get their own waffle when asked for a selfie in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', and wears a waffle-maker as part of his [[Infiltrator Kevin]] costume.

Kevin is also implied to have a crass and juvenile sense of humor, as shown in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''. When the [[The New Kid|New Kid]] farts on or near Kevin, he will respond with ""Heh, nice."" However, his animation shows him disgusted and angry.

Carol is Kevin McCormick's mother. They are never seen interacting one-on-one, although, judging from the pseudo-conversation they had in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", their relationship seems to be a weak one, filled with fighting. His relationship with his mother is likely stronger than with his father.

His mother does seem to care about him, because in ""[[Spookyfish]]"", she tells Kenny off for not sharing the blanket with Kevin. She also expects Kevin to do the same for Kenny, as shown in ""[[Chickenpox]]"" when she tells Kevin to split his waffle with him. 

It should also be noted that Kevin is the only McCormick child to share their mother's southern accent, although the accent has seemingly disappeared in his game appearances. 

Stuart is Kevin McCormick's father. Judging from the events of ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", they do not have a good relationship. Their relationship also seems to be violent, likely when they are drunk, with Carol McCormick having to step in to prevent them from physically fighting each other. They seem to ignore each other, except when Stuart is drunk. However, when sober, the two still seem to not get along, as shown when Kevin calls his father's alias Sizzler Stuart ""pretty lame."" In addition in ""[[The City Part of Town]]"" when the McCormicks are all in the living room adjusting to their new situation, Kevin has a neutral expression on his face. This expression soon shifts to annoyed anger and concern when Stuart starts to yell at Karen after she requests ice cream from Sodosopa. 

Kenny is Kevin's younger brother. The two are never seen interacting, so little is known about their relationship. They seem indifferent to each other's presence, completely ignoring each other. When seen together, it is usually with the rest of their family. Neither Kenny nor Kevin like sharing with one another. In ""[[Spookyfish]]"", Kenny tugs the blanket from him, and in ""[[Chickenpox]]"", Kevin has to share frozen waffles with Kenny, because of the lack of food. They seem to somewhat tolerate one another; in ""[[Chickenlover]]"", both were standing next to each other, giggling when their mom beat up their dad. In ""[[The List]]"", Kevin was extremely horrified when Kenny was shot by a stray bullet in front of him. 

In ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", Kevin is sitting next to Kenny during a rollercoaster ride at the amusement park. Later, he is seen at the hospital with his family, looking at Kenny in his 'tomato' state. The two can also be seen playing together in ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"".

Karen is Kevin's youngest sister. The two are never seen interacting, so little is known about their relationship. Kevin seems to either ignore her or stay distant from her, however, she seems to look for him for protection, hiding behind him in various instances. When Kevin is fighting with Stuart, the argument does scare Karen, causing her to break down and start crying. Unlike Kenny, Kevin is not as close to her. In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", when Stuart starts yelling at Karen, Kevin merely responds with slight concern, although Kenny scowls and runs after her. However, he does seem annoyed and concerned when [[Mr. Adams]] tries to get Karen to stop crying in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"".

Kevin can be found eating a waffle with his weary mother in the Mccormick's kitchen. However he will shoo you away if you ask him for a selfie, saying ""Get your own waffle!"" A rare standby line of his is stating that he saw [[The New Kid|you]] on TV. Like most other characters he will respond if you punch or fart on him, although he seems to find the New Kid's flatulence humorous.

Kevin Mephesto,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kevin_Mephesto,,"is a character who was first seen in the Season One episode, ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"". He is the [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto]]'s adopted son and his lab assistant.

Kevin took on a recurring role for the first four Seasons, being almost always seen alongside [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]], being seen as his silent lab helper. As of [[Season Five]], he, along with Mephesto, left their role on the show as supporting characters, making only cameos throughout the Seasons.

Kevin doesn't have much of a role in his first appearance in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", being seen only as a character who follows Dr. Mephesto.

In ""[[Starvin' Marvin]]"", Kevin appears again following Mephesto throughout the episode, and is asked by [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]] what he was supposed to be, who ends up not getting an answer.

In ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", he, along with Mephesto, are among the men who could possibly be [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s father. He is seen again in the sequel, ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"", where he witnesses the crime scene of Mephesto being shot. In the scenes of ''America's Most Wanted'', he is played by [[Eric Roberts]]. He is referred to by the narrator as the ""little monkey guy"" who follows Mephesto.

In ""[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]"", Kevin helps Mephesto take care of the recently found frozen man, including thawing him with a hammer.

He also makes relatively minor appearances in the episodes ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"", ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"" and ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"" , as usual, being seen alongside Mephesto.

Kevin's cameos in episodes after Season Four include ""[[Freak Strike]]"", where he is seen in the [[True Freaks Union]], among one of several people with deformities of appearance, ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"", being seen singing with Mephesto and the rest of the crowd at the end, and in ""[[Goobacks]]"", where he is seen singing ''[[The Future Begins With You and Me]]'' with the crowd.

Kevin finally makes another significant appearance in ""[[201]]"", along with Mephesto, where he is seen helping him tell Cartman about his father and witnesses [[Scott Tenorman]]'s revelation to Cartman at the end after being captured by his ginger minions. This episode marks the first time Kevin's voice is heard, albeit as only a brief scream.

Kevin again makes guest appearances in ""[[Bike Parade]]"" and ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", being seen alongside Mephesto in both episodes.

Kevin's story is told in the song ""[[Mephesto and Kevin]]"" by Primus from Chef Aid: The South Park Album. He was apparently a failed attempt to create a perfect pop singer, a test tube baby created from [[Michael Jackson]]'s sperm and the egg of an unspecified, musically talented female donor, brought to term inside the womb of a llama. It is also revealed Kevin is legally Dr. Mephesto's son.

Kevin appears to be some sort of warped clone of Mephesto. He has strands of black hair and facial hair on his face and an unusually large mouth. He wears a yellow flowered Hawaiian button-down shirt and brown pants. In ""[[201]]"", Kevin's character was redesigned alongside Mephesto's character, having a more detailed and polished appearance to suit the show's current animation.

Kevin Stoley,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kevin_Stoley,,"is a minor character in [[The Boys|the boys]]' class and first appears in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"".

Kevin was initially a nameless, background character who appeared in the boys' classroom and made background appearances alongside other fourth graders. He has his first speaking role in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"", where he is referred to as ""Kevin"" by Stan. Kevin's most notable traits are his ''Star Wars'' and ''Star Trek'' obsessions, seen in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"", ""[[Fatbeard]]"" and ""[[Black Friday]]"". Kevin is described by [[Trey Parker]] as the kid who is ""always screwing up the whole show"".He is first referred to by name in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"" by [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] as ""Casey"", but is referred to by Stan in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"" as ""Kevin"", a name used for many characters in the second season. Since then, he has consistently been referred to as ""Kevin"". 

During the thirteenth season, a character named Kevin Stoley was referred to off-screen in ""[[Fishsticks]]"" and it was revealed later in ""[[Fatbeard]]"" to be this Kevin. 

Kevin wears a sky-blue jacket with a red collar, red gloves, and dark blue trousers. His hair is black, and the style is similar to that of Stan's. The light blue color of his jacket explains why in the ancient scripts he was written as ""Sky"".

In terms of attractiveness, Kevin is ranked #9 on the rigged list for the cutest boys, created by the girls in ""[[The List]]"".

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', he dresses similarly to the Fourth Doctor of the ''Doctor Who'' universe, which consists of a multi-colored scarf, brown jacket over an olive green vest, light blue shirt, red tie, and blue pants. His hair has slightly grayed. 
Kevin's personality is little-known, but he is known for his ''Sci-Fi'' obsession, which he consistently annoys other characters (mainly Cartman) with - in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"" he is wearing a [[Stormtrooper]] mask while meeting with the other children in their Lord of the Rings outfits, and in ""[[Fatbeard]]"" he brings along a green lightsaber instead of a sword as a member of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s pirate crew. Kevin also has a tendency to ruin the moment for the other children, usually with a ''Star Wars'' reference. This will usually exasperate his classmates, but Cartman in particular, who will often respond with, ""Kevin, god damn it."" or ""Kevin, Jesus Christ."" An example is in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', where he references Star Trek in an irrelevant situation, ""Let us charge our shields and use photon torpedoes to vaporize the Klingons!"" and Cartman responds, ""Kevin, god damn it, every fucking time Kevin, god fucking damn it seriously."" This could imply that Kevin isn't only a fan of ''Star Wars'', but movies in the sci-fi genre in general. In the entire ""Black Friday"" trilogy, he plays ""Spock"" from ''Star Trek'', and in ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' he is also seen in the same attire.

There is a possibility that gaming might be one of Kevin's hobbies, in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"" Kevin was lined up outside a shop to get a PlayStation Portable, with several other children. Also, in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", it is shown that he is trying to help defeat the high levelled player, though it is impossible to tell which character he is playing as. It would not be odd if Kevin liked gaming, as he loves ''Star Wars''.

[[File:Future_Self_n_Me_Screenshot.jpg|thumb|248px|Mr. and Mrs. Brooks and the hired Kevin decoy.]]
In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' and ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', the player can visit the Stoley Residence and see a picture of Kevin with parents who have been seen in the background before  throughout the show.

In ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"", a couple known as the Brooks hire a man to keep their son Kevin out of drugs by using him as a ""future self"" decoy. Some fans believe he shares design similarities with Kevin Stoley. The same couple reappear in episodes like ""[[200]]"", ""[[201]] and ""[[T.M.I.]]"" in scenes consisting of mostly parent characters, suggesting they have a child in the fourth grade class.

It was mentioned in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"" by Kevin that he's from America but his parents are from China. None of the adults described here appear to be Asian-American.

He does not have any siblings as none are ever seen with either of his possible families.

Kevin's exact relationships/friendships are virtually unknown due to him only making a handful of speaking appearances, though in a few episodes he is shown sitting at lunch with the main boys.

During early seasons, Kevin and her were often animated together, sitting together at lunch for most of the first four seasons including during [[Damien Thorn]]'s attack in ""[[Damien]]"", and in ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"" where they trade fruits. They're also seen together in crowd scenes, talking in ""[[Gnomes]]"" before class starts, and shown at the movies together in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''

During ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"" he is seen alone at the dance near her while she dances with Tolkien. However, since the first four seasons the two only occasionally appear together in newer episodes such as ""[[Lice Capades]]"", in class in ""[[Fatbeard]]"", and arguably ""[[Super Fun Time]]"". They were together on Wendy's debate team in ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", Red was also one of the girls hitting on him in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"".

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"" it is revealed that the two had been in a relationship for an unspecified period of time prior to their break up. Kevin is notably shocked and can be seen weeping in the hallway staring at Red's note at the end of the episode.

During Seasons [[Season Nine|9]] to [[Season Thirteen|13]], after the lunch room was re-designed, Kevin was usually seen eating and talking with Bradley in a table near the cafeteria doors, and in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", along with [[Francis]] and [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]. They are also seen together in ""[[Lice Capades]]"", where they are the two boys who hold back [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] during his trial, as well as being the ones to remove his hood. When Bradley was formally introduced in the ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"" story arc, his given personality was also similar to Kevin's - in fact, a ''Star Wars''-esque poster is seen in Bradley's bedroom.

Kevin is seen hanging around with Timmy, Bradley, and Francis in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"" and later is seen talking with Timmy, along with Jimmy and Pip, in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"" The two have seldom been seen together since, but it is of note Timmy's special character design causes him to rarely be seen in the background.

Like everyone else in the school, Kevin likely despises Cartman, however he has only shown it once in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"" where he cheers for [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] and is seen quite pleased when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is knocked on the ground. Despite this, Kevin has actually aided him on a few occasions. Cartman greatly despises Kevin openly. He had no qualms about accepting Cartman as a leader on numerous occasions, meaning either he is a person who likes to follow orders more than give them, is too passive to fight back, or he trusts Cartman to some extent. In ""[[Fatbeard]]"" Cartman calls the pirate crew meeting at his house, with Kevin expressing surprise. It's unknown if Kevin joined the pirate crew by choice. Cartman is annoyed by Kevin's love of Star Wars, as shown in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"". However, in ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"" Cartman is seen hugging Kevin, though Kevin does not return the gesture.

Dougie was part of Kevin's Star Trek bridge crew in [[Black Friday]]. He tells his ""captain"" of a facetime request from Eric Cartman. He and Kevin are both convinced by Cartman to join his side to get Xbox Ones for cheap on Black Friday.

[[File:Jason and Kevin.png|thumb|220x220px|""Holy crap, dude, look at Butters!""]]
Kevin and Jason were first seen together in ""[[Marjorine]]"". They were later seen standing together for the national anthem in ""[[Wieners Out]]"". They were both at first concerned at what Butters was doing, but later on they took part in his movement. There were many other moments during playground shots where Kevin and Jason are seen playing or talking together, such as ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]."" This implied that they were good friends until Jason's death.

Kevin Stoley appears in the game as a minor character. He can be found in his bedroom, where he gives the player a side quest which requires finding his dad's iPad. He is also recruited by the humans and elves to participate in the siege on [[Clyde's Fortress|Clyde's fortress]], where he once again ruins the moment with a ''Star Trek'' reference.

[[The New Kid]] can request Kevin to follow them on [[Coonstagram]] (2 followers required). Otherwise, he can be found in his room interacting with a virtual reality set.

Despite having played a major role in only one episode, ""[[Fatbeard]]"", Kevin has made reoccurring appearances as a background character in South Park since [[Season One]], and he has had several speaking roles, his first being in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"".

Kevin is abundantly seen in the background of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s classroom, however this is not the case in [[Season Fourteen]], though he can still be seen in the hallways and in the canteen, or in the playground. During the [[Season Seventeen|Seventeenth Season]], Kevin's role as a background character arguably changes to a supporting character, as he is seen consistently in episodes ""[[Black Friday]]"", ""[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]"", and ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"".

Kid Rock,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kid_Rock,,"is an American musician who appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", during [[Eric Cartman]]'s research into how to appear mentally handicapped. He and his late sidekick Joe C. made a rap version of ""[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]"" for the [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut/Soundtrack|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut Soundtrack]].

Kid Rock has brown hair, which varies in tint, blue tattoos on his left arm, and unusually thick eyebrows. He also has a brown beard and mustache, which looks to be shaven in various lengths. He was shown wearing a black Bowler hat and a white tank top.

In ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", he was not shown speaking, but the fact that he was researched upon by Cartman, in order to find out how to appear mentally handicapped, suggests that he is of low intelligence.

Kim Jong-il,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kim_Jong-il,,"was the leader of [[North Korea]] from 1994 to 2011. He appeared in ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"" as a member of [[Christopher Reeve]]'s [[Legion of Doom]].

Kim has the stereotypical characteristics of Asians seen in the series such as small eyes. He also has various facial wrinkles, an abnormally large nose, thin, black eyebrows, and thick, peach-colored lips. He wears a green, presumably button-up shirt.

Kim does not have a major role in ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"", so little is known about his personality, however, it can be assumed he has a lust for power and is ill-intentioned, as he joined [[Christopher Reeve]]'s Legion of Doom, a short-lived supervillain organization.

[[File:Classroom 2.png|thumb|225x225px|The Kindergartners' classroom]]
The Kindergarten class was run by [[Herbert Garrison]] after he was demoted for being a homosexual. The classroom has one round table and a chalkboard. Mr. Garrison is shown to talk about rather odd subjects to the kindergartners. He has mentioned [[Fourth Grade|having a nervous breakdown and going up into the mountains]], and also his relationship with his father in which they still have skeletons in the closet.

The class has also been taught Sex Education by Mr. Garrison, who taught them how to put a condom on and different sexual positions. At the end of [[Proper Condom Use|the episode]] Chef stated that sex education could be taught by anyone. It could be taught by [[Mr. Mackey|someone who doesn't know]], [[Ms. Choksondik|someone who has a bad opinion of it]], or even [[Herbert Garrison|a complete pervert]].

The new kindergarten teacher was Ms. Stevenson as shown in ''[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]''. Ms. Stevenson and [[Ike Broflovski]] developed a sexual relationship. They couldn't be accepted so they both decided to kill themselves by jumping off a building. After some advice from Kyle, Ike stopped just before the jump but Ms. Stevenson jumped to her death while calling ""Ike?"".

In ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"", Mr. Garrison held an election for class president. It was between Ike and [[Filmore]]. It came to a tie and Flora who had the deciding vote, but couldn't choose.

The next day she chose Ike but Filmore's side stated there was an absent kid. He later came in from hospital and chose Filmore which made the vote a tie yet again.

Filmore then got his aunt Rosie O' Donnell involved, who Mr. Garrison mistook for a monster. She then tried to make the vote clear and eventually more people came along campaigning against different sides. Both sides hired lawyers but in the end, Filmore declined, making Ike class president.

When all the kids in town said their parents ""molestered"" them, the parents were arrested and the kids took over the town. They believed their provider was a giant [[John Elway]] statue. The town split in half, which apparently angered the statue, so therefore, a human sacrifice would be made to it from which ever side that didn't have ""the book"". The kindergartners were on the same side [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Wendy Testaburger]], and [[Timmy]]. Their side was named ""Treasure Cove"". The enemy side was run by the ""mayor"", [[Eric Cartman]], who named his side ""Smiley Town"". After a couple arrived in Smiley Town/Treasure Cover, they convinced the kids to allow their parents to be released. It is assumed every kindergartner was reunited with his or her parents.

Six Kindergartners can be seen in the park, where they play [[Hide 'n' Seek]] with the player, and when the player finds them all, they befriend him. A group of Kindergartners can be seen with their own faction, the Pirates, led by Ike (who refers to himself as ""The Pirate King"") and the player can battle them optionally.

Few other Kindergartners can be found playing at the [[Community Park]] playground. If the New Kid has [[Ike Broflovski]] as a Coonstagram follower, they may add Filmore as a follower as well.

Some kindergartners will be summoned by [[Doctor Timothy]] during the fight between [[Coon and Friends]] and the [[Freedom Pals]] during [[Civil War 2: Playtime's Over]] mission.

Kindergartner Girl with Brown Pigtails,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kindergartner_Girl_with_Brown_Pigtails,,"appears at her 6th birthday party in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, ""[[Cock Magic]]"".

[[Birthday Party Parents|Her parents]] throw a birthday party for her with other [[kindergartners]] in their backyard. They invite [[Randy Marsh]], a cock magician going by the stage name of the Amazingly Randy, to perform for the children. When the performance starts, the parents return to the kitchen to prepare the cake. Unbeknownst to them, Randy's cock magic tricks are performed with his penis. One of the tricks involves putting his penis into a magic box and sawing through it. The trick goes wrong and he cuts his penis off, spurting blood. The parents mistake the kindergartners' screams of horror for being excited by the show. Randy tells this kindergartner girl to reach behind her ear, as his penis had fallen there and is still wiggling. She hands it to him, utterly horrified.

It is then that her parents see what has happened and call the police. However, [[Harrison Yates]] accuses them of making a false cock magic report because he believes that cock magic is the card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering (CCG)]]''. He then arrests the girl's mother who was the one who called the police. The girl looks on, screaming and crying in her father's arms.

The kindergartner girl has dark brown pigtails with bangs tied with green ribbons. She wears a pink collared shirt with a large green button, green pants, and black shoes.

Kip Drordy,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kip_Drordy,,"Kip seems to be an outcast, who has no friends at all because everyone made fun of his appearance. In fact, he went six months on Facebook without a ''single'' friend request. As a result, he seemed to suffer from severe depression and would sit at his computer all day, waiting and praying for a friend request. This changed when [[Kyle Broflovski]] felt sorry for him and added him as a result.

Kyle's addition overjoyed Kip who began thinking of Kyle's Facebook friendship as a much deeper thing and began to address Kyle as his best friend, where sometimes he would wait for hours just staring at his Facebook page just for Kyle to reply and bring his computer to the movies while taking pictures of himself with Kyle's Facebook page. He would then proceed to tell his parents all the inane details of their collective Facebook updates.

Unfortunately, Kip's status as a loser negatively affected Kyle, who lost all his Facebook friends except for Kip and later [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] (who Kyle had to beg to friend him). [[Eric Cartman]] meanwhile features Kyle and Kip on his podcast, Mad Friends, in which he informs Facebook participants to steer clear of Kyle because of his association with Kip. Although reluctant at first, Kyle eventually removes him as a friend, resulting in Kip falling back into his depressed state. However, by the end of the episode, he had 845,323 friends on Facebook, due to Stan shutting down [[Profile Stan Marsh|his profile]] and transferring his friends to Kip, thus restoring Kip to being extremely overjoyed.

He has brown hair that is long, scraggly, and parted down the middle. He wears a green shirt and blue shorts. His hair also seems to be receding on the forehead, like his father's. He has a slight lisp and either has an over-bite or is simply biting on his lower lip. He is also noticeably chubby. Overall, Kip Drordy seems to share a resemblance to Rocky Dennis in the film ''Mask''. When depressed he positions himself in the exact same way as a ""Crying Clown"" poster on his wall.

Kip is an outcast. This has negatively affected his personality in many ways. He seems extremely insecure, becoming depressed over having no Facebook friends in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"". He also seems obsessive, even taking his computer to the movies in order to ""watch a movie with Kyle"" (Kyle was, at the time, his only Facebook friend).

Kip has a mother and a father, whose names are currently unknown. They both appear to be extremely loving and supportive of their son, both realizing, much to their sorrow, that he's an outcast with no friends. As such they are willing to listen to his insane rambling about Kyle. They may or may not realize that Kip is talking about Facebook and not an actual human friend.

In ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"" Kyle was Kip's one and only Facebook friend. Kip grew obsessive over Kyle, later becoming extremely depressed when Kyle ""unfriended"" him. They did not have a real-life friendship.

They are an American hate group and white supremacy organization that discriminates against African Americans and other minorities, such as Jews and Homosexuals.

In ""[[Pinkeye]]"", [[Principal Victoria]] noticed Cartman dressed as [[Adolf Hitler]]. To rectify this, she tried dressed him as a ghost, but he ended up looking like a member of the KKK.

Kyle Schwartz,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kyle_Schwartz,,"is [[Kyle Broflovski]]'s maternal cousin from Connecticut. He has heavy breathing, due to asthma. He also has poor eyesight, for which he has large glasses and are likely for farsightedness, due to the magnification of his eyes. He made his first appearance in the [[Season Five]] episode, ""[[The Entity]]"".

</gallery>

While his mother is in the hospital, Kyle stays with the Broflovski family during the events of ""[[The Entity]]"". He is a stereotypical American Jewish kid (with characteristics such as hypochondria, poor athleticism and being good with money), unlike [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who is worried about his anti-Semitic friend [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], whom he fears will constantly make fun of him. Kyle then offers Cartman forty dollars not to make fun of Kyle Schwartz. Cartman initially tries to comply with the agreement, but later makes a concentration camp joke in class, blowing the deal.

Kyle Schwartz then states that Kyle (Broflovski) should have tried to get away with paying Cartman $12.50, instead of $40. Angered by his ingratitude and personal quirks, the boys help Kyle try to get rid of him. They put him on a sled tied to a bus headed for Connecticut, and later seal him in a box and place him on a plane to Antarctica. He nevertheless keeps returning to the Broflovski home. In the end, his mother's condition improves, and he decides to go home after receiving $5,000,000 from an investment bailout to the airlines. The boys suddenly see their opportunity and try to convince him to stay, but Kyle Schwartz replies by saying that he couldn't stand how everyone in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] is a stereotypical hillbilly jock redneck.

Kyle also appears in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", where he calculates how many presents Cartman will get for Christmas, concluding that he will still owe two presents even if he finds a cure for cancer and [[AIDS]] before Christmas, and ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", where the boys play on the [[South Park Little League Baseball Team]] and have to get the worst person they can find to play because they do not want to qualify for a national tournament.

Kyle Schwartz is very good with investing and other matters concerning money. He states that one day he would like to be an investment banker. He is cautious and avoids trouble—this may be the reason he keeps returning after all the times [[The Boys|the boys]] try to send him away.

Kyle's upper lip is pulled above his teeth and his brown ""Jewfro"" is parted in the middle. He wears a dark pink jacket with blue triangles across it, and light green pants. His eyes are shown to be green when his glasses are on, and they appear as black dots when they are off. He is somewhat overweight, with a larger body profile compared to most other kids, seen by his outfits and particularly in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', where his stomach is shown protruding from his costume. In ""[[The Entity]]"", he has stated that he has lumps on the dorsal part of his hands.
Kyle's personality is representative of the stereotypical, nerdy Jew. He is able to handle money well, is a constant complainer, and is generally overly cautious. He also has various health issues, such as asthma and others.

La Resistance,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/La_Resistance_(Organization),,"is a formerly-secret organization created to stop the spread of influence from [[Mothers Against Canada]] in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

When [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Eric Cartman]] realize that their parents are spiraling out of control with [[Mothers Against Canada|M.A.C.]], they formed the organization with inspiration in the form of champion figure-skater, [[Brian Boitano]].

To Stan's dismay, [[Gregory]] actually seems to perfect ""La Resistance"", and even sings a beautifully inspiring [[La Resistance|musical number]]. The boys are admittedly disturbed by the gruesome acts of torture that Gregory claims their parents will do to them if they interfere, such as skinning them alive, burning them to death, or cutting off their penises and feeding them to pigs. He states that even though they may all die, what they stand for will live on forever. Gregory tells Stan and Kyle the address of where [[Christophe]] lives, due to his knowledge of mercenary, and to also help Stan and Kyle.

When the boys try to save [[Terrance and Phillip]], they are caught and Christophe is killed. [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] ghost appears and warns Cartman that they are running out of time, and that [[Satan]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] will arrive and plunge the world into eternal darkness.

This warning fails, and Terrance and Phillip are killed, causing Satan, Saddam, and multitudes of demons to appear and attack people. However, due to a malfunctioning ""V-Chip"", Cartman manages to shoot lightning to weaken Saddam. Kenny manages to get Satan to finish him off. Satan, showing gratitude towards Kenny for convincing him to leave Saddam, grants Kenny one wish. Kenny wishes everything to go back to the way it was ""before"". Satan grants this, therefore repairing the damage caused by M.A.C. and his army of demons had done.

La Resistance's flag is an anarchist flag consisting of a vertical red and grey bicolor with ""La Resistance"" written on it as well as crudely drawn heads of [[Terrance and Phillip]] in each color field.

[[The 4th Grade|the 4th graders]] are rehearsing for their [[The Miracle Worker|Thanksgiving play]] about Helen Keller. They are trying to put on a play as spectacular as possible, and decide to being in a turkey that can do tricks to fit with the Thanksgiving theme. [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] brings in [[Gobbles]], a disabled turkey, whom the kids feel is useless to them. Lamond answers their supervisor [[Jeffrey Maynard]]'s call to bring in his feat-performing turkey, Alinicia. However, Alinicia refuses to perform with another turkey and throws a fit. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] does not know what to do, so Lamond tells him to kill Gobbles in an ""unfortunate accident"". However Cartman accidentally gets [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] killed instead.

Lamond comes up with another idea. He lies to Timmy that an animal shelter is going to take Gobbles away from him and torture it, and the only way to prevent that is for Timmy to let Gobbles go into the wild. He even falsely claims the workers installing water effects at the play are the animal shelter workers coming to get Gobbles. Timmy believes him and reluctantly lets Gobbles go. However, during the play, he finds out that the workers are here to install the water effects, meaning Lamond had tricked him. He rushes off to find Gobbles. When he returns, he gets his revenge by ordering [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] and his hunting buddies to shoot Alinicia, leaving Lamond in despair.

Lamond has closely cropped greenish gray hair and a beard and moustache. He has sunken cheeks, a wrinkled forehead and a hook nose, and wears glasses. He is usually scowling. He wears a red scarf and a long dark gray coat over a pink and black striped sweater and teal trousers.

He is very mean, treacherous, and selfish. He devises several schemes to get rid of Gobbles to ensure that his turkey, Alinicia, will be the only star at the Thanksgiving play.

While she never speaks, she seems to often have a knowing smile on her face.

During Kenny's and Gerald's high trips, they both go on various adventures with her to places named after euphemisms for breasts.

Her father, presumably the king, seems willing to offer up his daughter to whatever suitor who wants her, and will even suggest they wash her ""rockin' tits"". Gerald, however, points out that she is not real at all.

Apparently, [[Randy Marsh]] has seen her as well when he points out ""you never get a good look at her naked boobs"".

Larry is first seen at the meeting held by [[Marvin Marsh]], reminding the other seniors about being angry about their driver's licenses being taken away, after they quickly forget why they were at the meeting. After the meeting is over and all the seniors have returned to their homes, Larry is seen with his wife in their car destroying a wall of the abandoned house that [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] and the [[The Boys|boys]] were hiding in.

He was discovered by [[the boys]], while pretending to be crocodile hunters in the woods. [[Kyle Broflovski]] wanted to call him Steve and [[Stan Marsh]] wanted to call him Gorak.

Stan and Kyle were able to remove Larry from the cavern and get him onto a sled. All four boys pushed the sled into town, thinking they would get a reward for finding the man. [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]] took charge of the ice man, thawed him out, and discovered he was from the year 1996. He made a habitat for the ice man to live in, one that represented his era, and charged people admission to view him.

Stan went to help Larry escape, when Kyle showed up for the same objective. Before Stan could do anything, Kyle opened the habitat door and the man, who revealed that his name was Larry, escaped. He sought out his wife, [[Leslie (""Prehistoric Ice Man"")|Leslie]], and found out she was with someone else and had two sons; one of them, eight, and the other, thirteen. Because he was gone for only three years, this bewildered him.

Upon losing hope, he went to Stan's house to refreeze himself. He is thwarted when Kyle offered a better idea, moving Larry to Des Moines, Iowa. Larry agreed and was headed out of town, when he is confronted by [[Steve Irwin]]. After a helicopter and a train collided, Larry got into the helicopter and flew away to Des Moines, Iowa.

Larry Feegan,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Larry_Feegan,,"was [[Shelley Marsh]]'s boyfriend in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"".

[[Stan Marsh]] and his sister Shelley Marsh stay the weekend at the Feegan's home while [[Randy Marsh]] and [[Sharon Marsh]] go to see Broadway musicals in [[New York City]].

During dinner, Shelley argues with [[Mr. Feegan|Larry's father]] over the irrational way he is treating Larry, forcing him to be a vegan from birth and to wear a life vest at all times. She suggests Larry can make his own decisions which would deter other children bullying him at school. Larry sees this as an act of bravery and begins trying to win the acceptance of Shelley.

As their friendship grows, Larry takes off his life vest, then he and Shelley go on a date to see the Broadway musical ""[[Wicked]]"" in [[Denver]]. Shelley's father, Randy Marsh, to save his daughter from acting on the ""subliminal subtext"" behind the play, interrupts the performance dressed as Spider-Man. He causes panic by accidentally breaking the water pipes thus flooding the theater. Ironically, Larry drowns due to him not wearing the life vest.

Larry is overweight, so much that his stomach bulges out of his shirt. He has blond hair and rosy cheeks and wears a striped yellow and turquoise shirt with a pair of blue jeans. He used to constantly wear a life vest around his neck, but he takes it off for Shelley. When he and Shelley go on their date, he wears a tuxedo and a purple bow tie. Whilst swimming, he wears purple swimming trunks.

Larry is very timid and lacks self-confidence. This is evident when he is afraid to jump off the diving board, and when Shelley speaks up to his parents about letting him decide if he wants to be a vegan. With that support, he plucks up the courage to disobey his parents by eating a Slim Jim and later at Burger King. Despite being very afraid, he also approaches Shelley and forms a budding relationship with her. He is shy and socially awkward, evidenced by the fact that he gets bullied in school and tells Shelley that it is the first time anyone ever stood up for him.

Larry's parents are overprotective and force him to wear a life vest, even on dry land. Their habit of wearing life vests all the time indicates that they are likely Survivalists. His father is a bully who is overly preachy in his beliefs in veganism and has forced Larry to be a vegan since he was born. It is evident that Larry is afraid of his parents and does not dare to question them. However, [[Mrs. Feegan|his mother]] appears to be nicer and more open-minded than her husband, as she decides to take a chance allowing Larry to leave his life vest off later on.

Shelley reluctantly accepts Larry as a friend, until he sings her a [[Out of My Shell|song]] about how she inspired him to overcome the fears of his parents and make his own food choices. After removing his life vest, Shelley invites Larry to play ''[[List of Video Game References#The Settlers of Catan|The Settlers of Catan]]'' on Xbox 360.

Shelley is actually crying when after the show was ruined and she finds out that Larry has died.

She also appears to be very tall, like her husband and is seemingly the tallest of the female characters.

After ""[[Pandemic]]"", she and her husband received updated character designs, smoothening out their clothing and adding [[Animation Changes|newer shading effects]] to their hair, as seen on multiple other characters. 

In ""[[The Magic Bush]]"", she was re-designed much more significantly, updated to a new body type with a thinner face and stronger chin, her hairstyle was tweaked to fit the new head model, her eyelashes were removed, her shoulders were broadened and her arms were less long. Her main outfit was now changed to a green sleeveless shirt with a green, flower-coated skirt, however in a few episodes she is also seen with an updated version of the coat she wore in previous seasons, which now has short sleeves with a white trim similar to the collar, seen in ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"" and ""[[Buddha Box]]"". Also in this episode, it was revealed that she fashions naturally grown pubic hair (i.e., neither trimmed nor shaved), with this fact actually being the focus of the episode's subplot.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', her hair has completely whitened, and wears a significantly larger bead necklace. Her green skirt does not have the flower design.

He had also become much stupider, but this was due to decay ruining his memories of his former life.

Lennart Bedrager,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Lennart_Bedrager,,"was an anti-troll activist and CEO of [[TrollTrace.com]]. He was the main antagonist of [[Season Twenty]], first appearing in ""[[The Damned]]"".

After [[Freja Ollegard]]'s death in ""[[The Damned]]"", a large community of [[Denmark|Danes]] held a massive funeral for her, conducted by Lennart Bedrager. While delivering the eulogy for Ollegard, Bedrager vowed to destroy the [[Skankhunt42|troll]] responsible for her death.

In ""[[Wieners Out]]"", Bedrager and several other members of the Danish community held another vigil for Freja Ollegard. He silently lamented about the return of trolls in a new form, and vowed to ""deal with them again.""

While meeting [[Gerald Broflovski]] in the park, [[Dildo Shwaggins]] shows him a BBC News video featuring Bedrager announcing his new internet service, [[TrollTrace.com]]. He mentions that the service will accept a troll's comments and return the name, address, picture, and internet history of the troll. When questioned about others using the service to spy on non-trolls, he simply stated that the service is to be used on trolls only.

With his service getting close to going online, Bedrager advertised a crowdfunding campaign to help boost popularity in ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"". Unbeknownst to him, however, the trolls were planning a massive troll in retaliation to the service. After the trolls successfully trolled [[Denmark]], Bedrager took TrollTrace offline from social media. Luckily, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]] offered their assistance.

Leslie Meyers,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Leslie_Meyers,,"was a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth grader]] and the main antagonist of [[Season Nineteen]]. She made her first appearance in the episode, ""[[Ginger Kids]]"" and was then killed by [[PC Principal]] in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"" after she is exposed as a self-aware advertisement in human form.

Leslie is always habitually caught by [[PC Principal]] chatting with [[Girl with Pink Coat|her friend]] during school assemblies; this has become a recurring joke throughout Season 19. She was even called out when she stopped chatting before the assembly in ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"" and reported to police in ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"".

In ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"", during the closing scene, it is revealed that PC Principal and Leslie may have some affiliation with each other.

In ""[[Sponsored Content]]"", she interviews [[Jimmy Valmer]] at the [[Newsmen]]'s headquarters and says she is ""special"", she asks if he is ""special"" too. Jimmy then figures out Leslie is a human advertisement and becomes angry with the salesmen asking if she knows this as well.

In ""[[Truth and Advertising]]"", she escapes the Newsmen with Jimmy's assistance when he realizes they want to boil her alive to hide the truth. However, this turns out to be a trick, and she then beats up Jimmy to carry out [[Nathan]]'s plan.

She has long, black hair that is similar to [[Jenny Simons]]'s in appearance with bouncy ends. Formally, her hair is brown and straight. She wears a yellow shirt with a black and white robot head on it (similar in appearance to the Reddit alien mascot, Snoo), green pants, and a large yellow headband. After being 'murdered' by [[PC Principal]], her head is shown to be filled with a strange glowing blue liquid and machinery.

Although she seems kind and friendly, she is cold and uncaring about human life or their well-being, as evidenced when she beat up Jimmy Valmer, even after he saved her from the newsmen's murder attempt, in order to carry out her plan. She is also very manipulative, as she emotionally manipulates both Jimmy and Kyle into helping her, even pretending to be attracted to the latter in order to advance her plans. Despite her robotic mannerisms, she does have some degree of emotion, such as happiness and surprise.

As an ad, she is shown to be able to perfectly imitate anyone's voice, as shown when she imitates President [[Barack Obama]] in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"". Her natural voice is an almost robotic monotone, a clue that she is not as she seems. Also as an ad, she can take human form, and unlike humans, has blue jelly-like blood when PC Principal kills her.

As an ad, she is also very cunning and manipulative. She successfully turns Jimmy, who is fully aware of her essence, into helping her escape from the Newsmen. Even the perfectly calm and rational Kyle was completely convinced that Leslie was not an ad.

Leslie can interrupt transmissions and insert ads in media. She uses this power to distract the Newsmen, making them unable to surveil so that she can have enough time to entice Jimmy.

Leslie is shown to be incredibly strong, able to beat Jimmy unconscious with punching and break the ceiling open just by throwing Jimmy at the ceiling. She does all of this with no visible signs of stress or even effort. She is also durable enough to briefly withstand an assault from PC Principal.

In her talk with him, he realizes she is an ad after her robotic responses. Despite this, in ""[[Truth and Advertising]]"", Jimmy appears to fall for her tricks and saves her from the [[Newsmen]] after hearing of their murder plans, which nearly gets them both killed. However, she double-crosses him to help [[Nathan]] with the [[Super School News]] paper to carry out her planned attack afterward.

She seems to not have a good relationship with PC Principal, with her getting yelled at four times by him for talking to her friend during a school assembly (and a fourth time when she stopped talking before being yelled). However, in ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"", this is revealed as a cover-up for a plot against South Park. In ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"" she is revealed to be a sentient robot ad and is destroyed by PC Principal at [[The South Park Gun Show]].

She came to Kyle at the end of ""[[Truth and Advertising]]"" because she heard how good he was at getting messages across, and because she thought he was cute. Kyle then protects her, and she goes on to trick him into thinking that Jimmy is dead and that PC Principal is the enemy. He then goes on to spread these lies to his friends, and at the South Park Gun Show.

It is possible that they are best friends, as Leslie is always chatting with her. She seems to chat with her friend all the time, even at school assemblies. It is unknown if she knew Leslie was an ad.

Lexus Martin,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Lexus_Martin,,"is a waitress in the Hooters-inspired restaurant [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]]. She made her first appearance in the episode ""[[Raisins]]"" as [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' choice in girlfriend. She did not return his affection, however, as being nice to boys is her job. She made an appearance in ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"", where she was seen dancing in the background.

Lexus was seen flirting with multiple boys at a time, as is typical for a [[Raisins Girls|Raisins girl]]. She talked to [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] on the phone, as well as winking at a couple of boys walking by. With her charm, Lexus had made Butters fall madly in love with her, and thus she got many tips and presents. He believed that he and Lexus were in a serious relationship, only for Lexus to dump him saying she only used him for extra tips and gifts, which left Butters heartbroken and saddened.

Lexus looks like all Raisins waitresses, dressed in a skimpy cheerleader-type t-shirt with the Raisins logo, orange shorts and white shoes. She has long, ginger-orange hair, wears purple eye shadow, blush, mascara, and red lipstick.

Lexus seems to be straightforward and unaffected by other people's emotions. She seems to be the biggest flirt out of all the Raisins, leaving her to have a more ""gold digger"" type personality than the others. She is shown to be rather intelligent, knowing how to get Butters to give her money easily. This could just be, though, because Butters gets attracted easily and that he is so naive.

Liane Cartman,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Liane_Cartman,,"is the mother of [[Eric Cartman]]. She makes many appearances throughout [[South Park|the series]] and is considered to be one of the most prominent out of all the [[South Park]] parents. She first appears in the [[Season One]] episode ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"".

</gallery>

Liane is a good-natured individual but with a definite edge to her. Her voice is usually kind and soft (but sounding even more sweet in the [[Season Four|4th]] through [[Season Seven|7th]] seasons when she was voiced by [[Eliza J. Schneider|Eliza Schneider]]) and her actions are usually to aid others, particularly [[Eric Cartman|her son]]. She is also a great cook, as implied by Stan and Chef in ""[[Damien]]"".

However, there has been many implications that Ms. Cartman is as racist and anti-Semitic as Eric, who on numerous occasions (at least during the early seasons) quoted his mother on saying offensive and politically incorrect statements regarding black people, gays, and Jews. Despite this, Liane herself has not vocalized these opinions on the show, so it is certainly possible that Eric was lying. An example can be seen in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"" when Cartman claimed his mom took him to see the movie ''The Passion'' in argument that proves Jews are sneaky liars.

In accordance with her sweet-natured, motherly image, she was originally frequently shown giving people her baking (usually cookies), even in situations where it is inappropriate. For example, in ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" she gives a plate of cookies to [[Officer Barbrady]] at the [[Drunken Barn Dance]], and behind the Cartmans' couch is a picture of her and Cartman by Mount Rushmore, in which she is holding a plateful of cookies.

She has also been shown numerous times to be extremely promiscuous, being referred to as a ""slut"" numerous times, making several sexual jokes, having sex tapes of her and [[Mr. Mackey]], etc.

She is also known to host great parties.

She also most recently got a job at [[South Park Realtors]] in ""[[City People]]"", but quit because Eric was scared he would have less attention. As a result, they were forced to move to [[Coney Island Hotdog]].

She is named after Liane Adamo, the ex-fiancée of South Park co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. The engagement was broken up because she reportedly committed infidelities on Parker during their engagement, hence the promiscuous nature. The character of Liane Cartman is one of the characters (another was the horse Liane from Parker's Cannibal! The Musical) Parker created as a bitter ""tribute"" to her.

[[File:SPLC1.jpg|thumb|Liane Cartman with Chef and Mr. Garrison in ""Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut"".]]
In ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"", it was stated that Liane Cartman was a hermaphrodite, meaning that she had both male and female sexual organs and that years ago during the Drunken Barn Dance, she proceeded to have sex with a series of men and women. After it was revealed that Liane was Cartman's father and mother due to the fact that she was a hermaphrodite.

However, in ""[[200]]"", Eric Cartman and [[Mitch Conner]] go to [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] and [[Mr. Hat]] who revealed that the events of ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" were a fabrication and the results for the paternity test were tampered with and that. However the identity of the father was not told until ""[[201]]"", in which Cartman was captured by his arch-foe [[Scott Tenorman]], who then revealed that Liane was not a hermaphrodite and Cartman's real father was Scott's own father, [[Jack Tenorman]], a Ginger who played for the [[Denver Broncos]], and who Cartman had arranged to be killed, made into chili, and fed to his half-brother Scott. It is explained that Liane had questioned whether or not to tell Eric, not because of her own personal feelings, but because the Broncos had been having a really good year, and she along with the rest of the town did not want to distract from the game season.

Despite her sweetness, she is extremely promiscuous. Quite early on, it was stated that Ms. Cartman was actually Eric's father, as she was supposedly born a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite with both female and male genitalia (though [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]] implies in ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" that she no longer has the latter). However, in ""[[201]]"", it is revealed that she actually is not a hermaphrodite, and that the town of South Park lied in order to protect the Denver Broncos.

In the early seasons, she was very sexually active and regularly pursued this activity. She was reputedly a crack whore, and has taken part in German scheisse movies. She also had no issue with commencing sexual relations with complete strangers, instead usually inviting them to the home as frequent visitors. This appetite is not strictly for men, for it is hinted in ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" that she had intercourse with Ms. Crabtree, Mayor McDaniels, and Sheila Broflovski.

Although Liane used to constantly have sex, and ignores the presence of anyone around her to sexually persuade men into her bedroom, it is unknown if Cartman knew the full extent to what his mom really did behind closed doors. Eric has come across various numbers of porn sites and so-called ""family videos"" gone awry, but seems to either ignore the fact that his mom is a slut or looks as it to be just his sweet, loving mother conned out of her own environment, such as when he explains that his mother told him she was young and needed money when she was featured in ''Crack Whore Magazine'' in ""[[Pinkeye]]"", to which Stan retorts, ""Cartman, those photos were taken a month ago!"" Cartman knows not to complain to his mother, probably already figuring out that if he makes her feel bad about hurting her son, she will eventually turn on him and no longer spoil him in the natural way. Even in ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"" and ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"" where it is revealed to Eric that his mom has had sex with the entire town, he still has no conversations with his mom about her secret life. Also in ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"", she ends up having sex with the cyborg from the future, [[Bill Cosby (BSM-471)|Bill Cosby]]. It is implied ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"" that she was having a threesome with Chef and an unnamed man.

In later seasons, her character seems to have changed. For instance, her working as a prostitute has only been occasionally referenced since the fourth season. She is now generally shown to be more responsible with Eric, especially in ""[[Tsst]]"" and ""[[Go God Go]]"". However, in ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", Cartman mistakes his mom's screams of pleasure for cries of sadness, when in reality, she is receiving sex from a plumber whom she invited to her house. Aside that instance, Ms. Cartman's infidelities have remained virtually unmentioned between the fourth season and ""[[200]]"". As mentioned above, whenever Liane has any male guests over, she'll offer to show them ""the rest of the rest of the house"" which she uses as an excuse to sneak the guest up to her bedroom and have sex with them as she does with Bill Cosby (BSM-471) in ""Trapper Keeper"".

In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', if the New Kid hits Liane with a weapon, she will either yelp or moan in amusement or say ""Oh, my!"" which reveals Liane's sexual appetite.

She can be seen again in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' when she decides to start again her ""Tutoring classes"" in the town, in which she ask [[The New Kid]] to help her spread the tutoring business cards in [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails|Skeeter's Wine Bar]] and giving it to three men.

She also appears in ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]'' as Sorceress Liane, a fighter under the Fantasy theme, with the ability of turning nearby enemies into [[A Cock|cocks]] upon her death.

[[File:Screenshot-by-nimbus_(1).png|thumb|Liane's formal black dress]]
Liane is about average height for an adult female ''[[South Park]]'' character. She wears a turquoise sweater, and brick red trousers. Her outfit slightly resembles that of Cartman's, in that her sweater is the same color as his toque, and her trousers are like his coat. She has long brown hair which is usually tied back in an old-fashioned bun design, and wears rosy lipstick, and usually has a sweet, motherly expression on her face.

As a teenager or a young adult at the 12th annual drunken barn dance, she wore a dark red long-sleeve crop top, a dark black skirt, and dark red shoes to match the shirt.

For special occasions, she wears a black dress with gray lining on the top that partially reveals her cleavage and a white necklace. In ""[[Tonsil Trouble]]"", she wears a red version of this dress. When dressed for bed, she wears either a dark cyan nightgown or a pink robe, and often wears a green facial mask.

When outside of the house or re-entering the house, she is often seen wearing a light brown trench coat over her usual outfit, especially in newer episodes from the [[Season Fourteen|fourteenth]] and [[Season Fifteen|fifteenth]] seasons. It is usually buttoned up with a belt around her waist, but sometimes she leaves it open. She wears it most prominently in ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"" where she wears it for nearly the entire episode.

In ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"", she wore glasses while driving, which implies that she is nearsighted. However, in later episodes such as ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"" she drives without them.

In ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]'', she wears the same black formal outfit as in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"" but with a pointed sorcerer hat and a broom, despite her card artwork showing that she wears a black bodysuit.

In ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"", she wears a yellow face covering over her mouth and nose during the riots. She wears it over her chin while standing on the street outside the school, waiting for Mr. Mackey to make an announcement on the students' conditions.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', her attire has not really changed much other than her wearing a blue button up cardigan over her regular sweater. She has visible bumps and wrinkles on her face and her hair has darkened due to old age. She also gained a little bit of weight.

[[File:216_cartman_family.gif|thumb|Some of Liane's relatives.]]
Liane understood a German-speaking man in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', indicating that she may be of German descent, though it may just be that she learned the language while filming the scheisse films, which are German. According to Eric, she is Dutch-Irish on her mother's side.

Her family is shown for the first time in ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"", where she, her son, and the rest of the main four, go on a trip to Nebraska to visit them for Christmas. Most of her relatives appear to be similar in matter to her son; all fat, with the same speech impediment and catchphrases such as ""Kickass!"" and ""RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH!!"" ""No, (Pet's name), that's my pot pie. No, (Pet's Name), that's a bad (Pet's Name)!"". The family is seen again in the beginning of ""[[Cartmanland]]"" at her mother's funeral — where she leaves her estate (valued at $1,000,000) to Eric, citing that all the other family members would have spent it all on crack.

Liane shows great deference to her overweight son Eric, and has been seen on numerous occasions bowing to his will, constantly spoiling him rotten. She also ignores his obesity (often saying that he is ""just big-boned"") and will usually give him some normal food smothered in junk food, as seen in the pilot episode ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", giving Cartman a, ""chocolate chicken pot pie with icing on top"". Of course, Eric's obesity is at least partly genetic. It is seen that Eric and his mother have a great bond with each other. However, since ""[[Tsst]]"", she has begun to grow resistant to his whining and his demands — seen in ""[[Go God Go]]"" and ""[[Go God Go XII]]"", where she is quite stern with him when he shows great impatience regarding the release date of the Nintendo Wii console. She shows further resolve in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" and ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", during which she punishes Cartman for his behavior and violent actions against his friends, particularly [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] and [[Bradley Biggle|Bradley]]. She also shows further resolve in ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"", where she refused to buy Cartman an iPad because it was way too expensive and then refused to head back to [[Best Buy]] to get a Toshiba Handibook due to Cartman's unacceptable behavior at the store.

Liane rarely raises her voice (the most prominent occasion being in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", in which she suggests he go out and play with his friends and then shouts ""don't be difficult Eric!"" when he protests, and in ""[[Shots|Shots!!!]]"", during a school meeting when Sheila insinuates that Liane does not love Cartman enough to vaccinate him, Liane yells at her and the rest of the protesting parents that none of them have had to hold Eric down and go through what she goes through), and the only discipline she dispenses is a very rare slap on the head when Eric embarrasses her in public (in ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"" and ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"") and infrequent grounding such as when he tried to exterminate the Jews, or when he saw the [[Terrance and Phillip]] movie two times then accidentally made Kenny set himself on fire. She has shown admonishing him not to pick his nose (to which he insists he was only scratching it). In ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", Liane not only punishes Eric for being bad, every time he talks back to her, she would raise her voice. In ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"", Liane again shows a strong stance against her son, as she is seen yelling at Cartman for loudly implying that she was ""fucking him"" (leading others to believe he means sexually, when in truth he means figuratively). She seems to have no issue yelling at him in public anymore as she berates Cartman's misbehavior on the Dr. Phil show. In ""[[Shots|Shots!!!]]"", although initially allowing Eric to get away with not receiving his shots and receiving a toy after every visit, she decided not to force her child to get shots, although when he asked to get a toy, she firmly yelled that he would not be allowed to get a toy since he did not receive his shots, demonstrating she is no longer willing to reward Eric when he does not deserve it.

Liane has also supposedly instilled in Cartman some of his bigoted behavior towards the Jews, gingers, and black people. Cartman was often heard to quote his mother's supposed beliefs, much to the surprise of his friends and the towns people. Liane however has never vocalized these opinions on camera, leading to questions of whether or not she really said them or if Cartman misquoted her or made it up. However, in [[Pinkeye]], Liane created for Cartman an Adolf Hitler costume for Halloween, which at the time Cartman had no idea who Hitler was. In ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"", she told her her son to stay away from Kyle because he had AIDS, when Kyle actually had kidney failure. Also, in ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"", she had Kyle hold [[Florence Cartman]]'s catheter bag. This implies some sort of bigotry or at least ignorance on Liane's behalf. In ""[[Ginger Kids]]"" she screamed when she realized that Cartman turned ginger (though Kyle, Stan, and Kenny dyed his hair and whitened his skin to make him look ginger). However, [[Lisa Cartman]] and [[Jack Tenorman]] are both ginger.

In more recent episodes, Liane seems to have grown tired of Cartman's behavior. This was seen in ""[[Shots]]"" where she gets embarrassed and upset after Eric freaked out when the doctor attempted to give him his shot despite Eric promising her that he would let the doctor do so moments earlier. She reluctantly lets Eric pick out a toy he was not deserving of. At the end of the episode, though she would not force Cartman to get shots, she refused to let him pick out a toy that he did not deserve in the first place. In ""[[Pajama Day]]"", after Cartman tells Liane that she got his demands of what to say to [[PC Principal]] on the phone wrong, Liane responds with an annoyed expression. At the end of ""[[City People]]"", Cartman's actions not only caused Liane to lose her job but also caused the both of them to move out of their home and into Coney Island Hotdog. Liane is clearly upset of the situation and even ignores Cartman who tries to make light of it and acts oblivious of what he caused. In ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars]]'', Liane finally admits to Cartman that she is tired of giving into him and that his actions caused are what caused the both of their current living state. Cartman, on the other hand, devises a plan to coerce Liane into getting a breast implant, which escalated all the way up to a legal issue in ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars Part 2]]'', further angering Liane.

In terms of friends, she seems integrated into the circle of parents around the town often seen interacting with [[Sharon Marsh]], [[Sheila Broflovski]], [[Carol McCormick]] and the other parents when they congregate. However, ""[[Tsst]]"" seems to imply that Liane has few or no friends, and that her servitude to her son is a psychological attempt to make up for that. Given how rarely she is seen alone with the other mothers - usually while the children are playing or as a group - it is possible that she does not consider them friends due to their relationships being more related to their children. Her loneliness could also be a reason for her promiscuity.

She can be seen sweeping in her kitchen the first time the New Kid joins Kupa Keep and after the Elves' first attack when the player leaves. On the player's first night, she tells Cartman and his ""little druid friends"" to go get ready for bed. She can be talked to and friended on Facebook. She also attends the PTA meeting in the quest ''[[PTA Problems]]''.

Liane had a major role early on in the series and was the most prominent of [[The Boys|the boys]]' parents, but over time she gained less spotlight as [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] took on that role. She has had a speaking role in every season to date, as well as in [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|the movie]] and several video games.

Libby Perkins,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Libby_Perkins,,"is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth-grader]] with disabilities who appears in several episodes with other [[Special Ed Kids|handicapped children]].

Libby's first appearance was in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", where she participates in the Special Olympics. After her appearance at [[Lake Tardicaca]] as a member of the [[Blue Team]] in ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", she, along with the other special children, began making occasional appearances throughout the seasons.

She plays some notable roles in her second appearance, being first seen training swimming with the help of counselor [[Steve]] and later being puked by [[Towelie]] who was high. She is also seen dancing during the [[Tardicaca Hula Gal]] sung by [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]. In this episode her name was revealed as '''Lenora'''.

She makes an appearance in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' DLC [[Bring the Crunch]], where her name was changed to Libby Perkins.

Lieutenant Dawson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Lieutenant_Dawson,,"is a police officer who appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"" as the lead detective of the [[Park County Police Force]].

Lieutenant Dawson was a South Park police lieutenant who made [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] junior detectives after they got [[Sarah Peterson]]'s doll back from [[Bill]] and [[Fosse]]. He is a parody of the typical television police lieutenant or detective character, with a thick mustache and smoking often, complaining about [[Mayor McDaniels|the mayor]] being ""on his ass"" and yelling about the kids' maverick ways and the massive property damage they unintentionally caused. He was unaware that two of his detectives, [[Murphy and Jenkins]], were on the take from [[Gino]] the crime boss. He also had an antagonistic relationship with FBI [[Agent Fields]].

Dawson made a cameo appearance with no lines in ""[[Britney's New Look]]"" in the town where [[Britney Spears]] was being executed.

Lieutenant Dawson wears black pants, a green shirt with white stripes, a blue tie and black suspenders. He wears his badge on his right suspender strap and he has his gun and gun holster on his left suspender strap. He has black hair with graying sideburns. He also has a black mustache. 

He appears to be foolish and unintelligent, sending the boys on adult police missions without realizing that the boys are not qualified police officers, but are simply children playing games. Doing this was also unprofessional and irreponsible, as he endangered the boys' lives by placing them in dangeous sitations. He also incorrectly blamed the boys for their failures during their missions, when in reality the failures were his responsibility, as he should have never tasked the boys with such work in the first place.

Nelson notes that this is one of the most unstable vagina he has ever dealt with. While a sniper takes his position, Lt. Nelson orders his team to hold fire, citing too many hostages in close proximity. 

During the standoff, Towelie manages to free the hostages by unlocking the bank's entrance from the inside. With the hostages cleared, Lt. Nelson gives the order to shoot, killing Oprah's anus Gary.

Lieutenant Nelson wears a SWAT jacket over a white shirt with red tie, a bulletproof vest, navy blue pants and shoes.

She is voiced by [[Mona Marshall]] and first appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"". She was originally referred to as Carol in ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", however, she is referred to as Linda in ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"".

In ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", she and her husband beat up Butters for swearing at them when it was really Cartman who swore at them.
*'''Attempted murder:''' In ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", she went insane when she found out her husband was going to places for homosexuals and tried to kill Butters, so he would not be raised by a 'sick pervert'.
*'''Human trafficking:''' In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", she is willing to sell Butters as [[Paris Hilton]]'s pet for a large sum of money.
*'''Lying To authorities''' and '''making a false police report:''' In ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", she and her husband file a false police report that Butters was kidnapped by a Puerto Rican man when he was actually in a car streaming in bodies of water by her.

In ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", she is shown to have at least some skill in wall painting. When she goes temporarily insane, she spends all day painting coat after coat of paint on the walls in her house. Indeed, Butters even says that his father should get her a larger paintbrush for their anniversary.

Linda wears a maroon sweater, a calf-length purple skirt, and black flats. She has shoulder-length blonde hair, and a long, slim face. Her breasts are lopsided, with her right breast being noticeably larger than her left. She also wears red lipstick, much like [[Sheila Broflovski]] and [[Liane Cartman]].

For special occasions, she wears a red dress, as seen in the award ceremony in ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"".

In ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", Teresa Giudice from The Real Housewives of New Jersey said she had yellow teeth.
Linda is shown to be a quiet, submissive woman. She is often seen reading or cleaning the house. She tends to be more sympathetic and tender toward her son but goes along with her husband's parenting methods because she feels he knows more about it than she does.

She also seems to be very mentally unstable, going insane when she found out her husband is bisexual and cheated on her with several gay men to the point of her attempting to kill both Butters and herself.

She seems to hang out with the other mothers in South Park often. She and Stephen seem closest to Sheila and Sharon. Perhaps this is because their son was the fourth friend of the main characters for a while in the sixth season, during Kenny's semi-permanent death.

Although she is thought to be friends with the other [[The Boys|boys]]' moms, [[Sharon Marsh]] said that she was sometimes annoying in ""[[Crème Fraiche]]"".

She was a prime focus in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, ""[[The Hobbit]]"", where she is now named Lisa Berger.

Lisa has messy brown hair. She wears orange pants, a purple shirt, white socks, and black shoes. She's also overweight and has a noticeable overbite. Her pants are worn above the waist. She has red freckles on her face and also wears yellow glasses.

Lisa has a crush on Butters in ""[[The Hobbit]]"". While the other girls tease her for it, [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] encourages her to privately ask him out. Taking her advice, Lisa approaches Butters in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|cafeteria]] and asks him out to go see a movie. While Butters appreciates her kindness, he rejects her on grounds that he's turned off by her weight, much to Lisa's disappointment.

However, Butters later feels sorry for rejecting Lisa after seeing a photoshopped image of her class photo done by Wendy as a means to demonstrate the attractiveness methods that celebrities like [[Kardashians|Kim Kardashian]] use to affect the male population. As a result, he is eager to go out with Lisa and win her heart, only to find out that [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] has started dating her, to Butters' jealousy.

After seeing a photoshopped image of Lisa going from overweight to beautiful, Clyde starts dating her, believing that her appearance actually transformed into how she's depicted in said photoshopped image. The two are shown to be rather appreciative of one another's company.

Wendy appears to be great friends with Lisa, always willing to help her out in bad situations and defend her from those picking on her. They first interact in ""[[The Hobbit]]"", when they are part of the South Park Cows Cheerleading Squad. As the girls announce their names while doing Cheer Squad roll call, Lisa's voice comes out quietly and shyly as opposed to the other girls. This leads the girls to be dissatisfied with her presence and demanding that they do one without Lisa.

Wendy defends her, boosting her self-esteem by encouraging her to show off her sassiness to boys. The other girls reveal that Lisa has a crush on Butters and starts teasing her because of it. Angered from their bullying, Wendy advises her to ask him out. After Butters rejects her, Wendy angrily confronts him, stating that Lisa is very nice and therefore he should care more about her personality rather than her appearance.

However, she later angrily calls Lisa ""ugly and fat"" after Butters excessively goes on about how hot he finds her after viewing the photoshopped image Wendy made of her, though she feels regretful for saying so after realizing that Lisa heard what she said.

However, Lizzy's mouth can be seen. Her parka has gray fleece padding and buttons up. She also wears gray gloves, dark gray pants, and black shoes. To date, her hair has never been shown onscreen.

Lizzy seems to be very stubborn and competitive, as she challenges the boys without hesitation when they do not hand over the sleds, exhibiting confidence in her team's ability to win a sledding competition against them. She enjoys taunting the boys and coming up with creative insults, such as ""Ass Rammers"", ""Poo Sniffers"", ""Butt Pirates"", ""Rump Rangers"", ""Fudge Packers"", ""Pillow Biters"", ""Turd Burglars"" and ""Doughnut Punchers"". She rubs it in their faces when they lose [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] as a fellow sledder and reminds them of the upcoming competition, including calling them on a home phone to harass them. Her sexually advanced vocabulary also suggests a vulgar sense of humor uncommon among female characters in the show.

Lizzy was depicted alongside [[Bebe Stevens]], [[Sally Turner]], and [[Esther]] in her speaking appearance, where the three girls made up the members of her sledding team; they were also seen at her house when she called the boys up to taunt them.

ManBearPig,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/ManBearPig_(Character),,"is a demon from [[Hell]] that thrives on temptation, often making deals that involve causing immense carnage toward the next generation when the debt is due. Though often appearing feral, he is sentient and intelligent, sometimes wearing clothing or having specific goals.

The creature was first believed to be a fictional creation of [[Al Gore]] he used to advance his career, but was proven to be real in ""[[Time To Get Cereal]]"", when it began to menace  [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] citizens.

When ManBearPig appears in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"", he dismembered several scientists and nearly kills Kyle just because he could hold him hard. ManBearPig is also able to overcome Satan's strength in ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"", killing the latter.
*'''Injury Immunity:''' ManBearPig was shown to be immune to common weaponry in ""[[Time To Get Cereal]]"", when Jimbo Kern tries to shoot the demon was immune to natural common weaponry.

</gallery>

ManBearPig was introduced in the episode of the [[ManBearPig|same name]]. Al Gore gives a presentation to the students of [[South Park Elementary]], in which he claims that the creature walks the Earth alone and ""doesn't care who you are or what you did, he simply wants to get you"", declaring that he is the one to kill ManBearPig and that he is ""super cereal"". [[The boys]] do not believe him.

Later, when they are playing basketball, the silhouette of a mysterious creature is seen across the horizon. It is immediately revealed to be Al Gore in disguise attempting to spread awareness of ManBearPig. [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] later picks the boys up, telling them there is no such thing as a ManBearPig and that Gore is just trying to look for attention.

The next day [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], feeling sorry for Gore, convinces [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to go hunting with him for ManBearPig in the [[Cave of the Winds]]. Gore leads them away from the tour to find ""clues"" to ManBearPig, asking them to search for ManBearPig's droppings. Gore soon accidentally causes a cave in, but he falsely blames it on ManBearPig, and flees the cave with the tour, leaving the boys trapped inside. 

While everybody is trying to dig out the boys, Gore attempts to flood the cave, believing this will kill ManBearPig. Rescue diggers free the boys just as the flood destroys the cave. Gore ecstatically believes he has killed ManBearPig, but is shouted at angrily by Stan for nearly killing him and his friends. Gore doesn't seem to care in the least, and promises to make a movie about himself.

[[File:ImaginationlandPartII17.jpg|thumb|ManBearPig kills [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"".]]
ManBearPig returns in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"", where he is heard speaking to declare himself the most evil imaginary creature and disagreeing with the Minotaur. He returns later when the portal between Imaginationland opens, rampaging the government laboratory and killing numerous people including Kyle. ManBearPig is pulled back into Imaginationland, taking Stan with him, but Cartman is able to revive Kyle from his injuries.

When Gore pores over security footage and uncovers the evidence of ManBearPig's existence, he declares that the imagination must be nuked. The government agrees, but only because Imaginationland has a terrorist connection. He is present for the final battle at Imaginationland, but his ultimate fate is unknown after [[Butters Stotch]] restores the timeline.

ManBearPig returns in ""[[Time To Get Cereal]]"", and goes on a rampage in South Park and the surrounding area. [[Jimbo Kern]] and [[Ned Gerblanski]] track him to [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]], where he appears and attacks Ned, taking him away. Later, he brutally mauls two children outside South Park Elementary, though [[Harrison Yates|Detective Yates]] assumes the cause of death is another school shooting. ManBearPig is next seen slaughtering most, if not all, the customers at [[Red Lobster]] before attacking a [[Baskin-Robbins]] as well. With help from Al Gore and [[Satan]], Kyle, Kenny, Cartman and Stan discover that ManBearPig is a demon who was summoned to Earth decades ago, but they are arrested for the ""shootings"" instead.

[[File:ManBearPig vs Satan.png|thumb|ManBearPig fighting and killing Satan in ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"".]]
ManBearPig's rampage continues in ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"", starting with the murder of a couple outside a [[Jared: The Galleria Of Jewelry|Jared]] jewelry store. The boys manage to escape jail, and Stan returns home to the farm and learns that his grandfather, [[Marvin Marsh]] was responsible for summoning ManBearPig and confronts him. Marvin admits he and the other old people summoned the demon decades ago, but they didn't realize he would live to see the consequences of his actions. In the meantime, Kenny, Cartman and Kyle request help from Satan who agrees to help the boys defeat ManBearPig. However, in the fight with Satan, ManBearPig manages to subdue and kill him by ripping off his left horn and plunging it into his chest.

Stan, who is granted power of attorney by his town, enters in a sit-down negotiations with ManBearPig which tells them that he will never come back again if they will give up soy sauce and ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', but people outside the court show reluctance and refuse to sign the agreement. Stan has no choice but to talk with ManBearPig's lawyer about restructuring another deal in which ManBearPig is set to return in five years, in which time the carnage will be a thousand-fold.

He makes a brief cameo celebrating the end of the [[COVID-19]] pandemic in the ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"".

In ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars]]'', it is revealed that ManBearPig is responsible for causing a drought in Colorado that is affecting Denver as well as Park County. He is soon shown to have killed [[Talnua Cussler]] and revealed to be working for [[Pi-Pi]] who is buying up all of the water in the mountains for his water park, and has the demon attack [[Steve Black]] and kill the [[Water Commissioner]] to maintain control. In ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars Part 2]]'', Pi-Pi becomes furious over Randy's plan in restoring the state's water supply which was well-received over his own, and orders ManBearPig to put a stop to the plan, which includes destroying the [[Government Desalinization Plant]]. However, it is revealed during a commercial shooting at the water park that Pi-Pi had been attempting to control [[Chuck Chuck|climate change]] by ""fucking [[PigBearGirl|its mom]]"", which turn ManBearPig against Pi-Pi, killing the latter as a consequence.

In the drawing presented by Al Gore, ManBearPig is shown to be a humanoid creature with hooves, claws, fur growing all over his body, pig-like ears and snout.

In the flesh, he is portrayed as a hulking chimera whose face is that of a pig on one side and that of a bear on the other. His body is partly covered in hair and has some human features on his torso. He has human-like legs and pig-like feet. The left side of his face is usually covered in blood, but appears to have human-like flesh beneath it.

When he returns in ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars]]'', the blood that was formerly covering his left side has been cleaned off, and he now wears a brown beanie, two gold chains, a buttoned striped blue shirt, gray pants, a golden watch, and a black leather jacket, and by the end of ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars Part 2]]'', he removes the clothing.

ManBearPig is at least physically stronger than Satan. However, it is unknown if is ManBearPig truly more powerful than Satan, since he had not possessed a human host like [[Possessed Stan Marsh|Stan Marsh]] to use powers such as absorbing Vortex Creation or fire manipulation. His powers include, but are not limited to:
ManBearPig is the penultimate boss in ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', on the level ""Mountain Pass"". Like other bosses, the players' goal is to keep him from reaching the town, or else the game is lost. His role in the overarching storyline is never explained. If players manage to kill ManBearPig without using any towers on Insane mode, they will earn a Platinum medal and the ""MANBEARPIG"" achievement.

ManBearPig appears as an enemy in ''[[South Park: Tenorman's Revenge]]''.

He had a cameo along with the rest of the band in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"".

Mark wears a short-sleeved pink shirt, torn cyan shorts, pink socks, and black shoes. Jonesy has long, messy brown hair and appears to be underweight. He has many dirt marks on his shorts.

Mark is the bass guitarist in Skyler's band (despite playing a six-string guitar, although he may play a six-string bass), and his personality is a parody of the 'peacemaker bassist' archetype in stereotypical rock bands. Despite playing in a heavy rock outfit, Mark is portrayed as comically passive. This is evidenced by his most distinguishing feature; his quiet, high-pitched, faintly lisping voice, which always makes him sound nervous and uncertain of what he's saying irrespective of context.

The key instances of his nervous behavior are in ""[[Timmy 2000]]"" when he lisps quietly, upon hearing Skyler and [[Jonesy]] fighting at practice, ""Hey you guys you better stop fighting..."" whilst hugging his beat up six-string guitar defensively. Similarly, near the end of the episode, after Skyler's solo act fails, he says ""Oh so now that they want us, you think you can just waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again?"". This is the angriest Mark has ever been to date. More instances of angry behavior occur in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"" when he calls [[Shelly]] a bitch and challenging her to do better after she states that they need work after performing a song [[Skyler]] wrote for her.

Unlike Skyler, who seems motivated by the idea of fame, or Jonesy, who veers between disinterest and enthusiasm for their 8-year-old rock band; Mark seems actually motivated by the desire to play music. His quiet comments are always about the interests of the band, not himself, and he also defends [[Timmy]] in ""Timmy 2000"" when Skyler gets jealous of him, saying ""Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous!""

Also, the only times he ever seems anything other than nervous is when he's playing onstage. Then, he starts to headbang more naturally (as opposed to the static, practice headbangs the band do in their garage) and stamps his left leg to the beat. This is also the only time he genuinely smiles. Along with [[Jonesy]], he provided the backing vocals for [[Skyler]] and later [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]], though he always does a higher harmony than the other band members.

Mark Fuhrman,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_Fuhrman,,"is an author and former L.A.P.D. detective who is best known for his involvement in the O.J. Simpson murder trial in 1995. He appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"".

In ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", he comes to [[Randy Marsh]]'s defense against the tolerant rednecks, along with [[Michael Richards]] and several other individuals labeled as ""NMark Furman wears black pants, a gray shirt, and a black suit coat. He has black hair, which is graying on top, and gray eyebrows.

As pointed out by the rednecks who chased Randy, Fuhrman became known for using the N-word during the O.J. Simpson murder trial in 1995. While being cross examined by defense attorneys, he claimed that he had not used the N-word 10 years prior to the trial, but witness testimony and taped interviews later revealed that he had used it multiple times until the late 1980s, leading to him being labeled a racist and severely damaging the prosecution's credibility with the jury.

The incident was also discussed previously by [[Harrison Yates]] in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"". He pointed out that the L.A.P.D. failed to frame O.J. Simpson, despite their efforts, because ""somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times"".

Mark Cotner,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_Cotner,,"appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", when his car breaks down in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] on the way to a job interview.

The children got rid of all the adults by getting them arrested for molestation. Mark, with his wife [[Linda Cotner|Linda]], break down in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], which has been renamed ""Smiley Town"", on the way to a job interview. They then walk into town for a phone and come to a garage, where they meet [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]. Butters tells them that they must go to Treasure Cove, where they will find a phone. They do so and are attacked and taken to the Mayor, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. He tells them to get a book from Treasure Cove, meaning someone from that side will have to be sacrificed for ""Carousel"".

Mark and Linda proceed to Treasure Cove, and are again attacked and taken to [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. They tell him to get a book from Smiley Town. He does so and the clock chimes, meaning someone from Smiley Town must be sacrificed. Before Butters is sacrificed, Mark gives a speech about how parents are important, and the boys decide to tell the police that their parents didn't really molest them. The next day, Mark comes back to South Park and tells the boys he got the job.

Mark wears black shoes, blue jeans, a teal shirt, and a brown jacket.

Mark Cotswolds,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_Cotswolds,,"is a home-schooled kid that took part in, and won, the 15th Annual [[South Park Spelling Bee]] in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"".

Mark is very sheltered in his home-school life and until the spelling bee had not seen the outside town. Mark wants to go to a [[South Park Elementary|public school]] and begs his father for the chance.

Mark is made to go to school in a giant hamster ball and experiences bullying at the hands of the other boys and wound up duct-taped to a bench. Though his father wants him to return to homeschooling, Mark convinces his father to let him continue to go to public school, and attend the school dance.

At the [[Bay of Pigs Memorial Dance|dance]], Mark confronts [[Kyle Broflovski]] for turning [[Rebecca Cotswolds|Rebecca]] into a slut, and proceeds to beat him up. The other boys become impressed, now wanting to hang out with him and include him in their circles.

Though his father tries to intervene and take Mark and Rebecca out of the dance, Mark convinces his father to let them go to public school, as the two of them would still have to face bad things someday, and it would be better to face them now.

Since the episode, Mark has reappeared in the show, making cameos in ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", as a potential fourth friend, ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", in the group of kids sent to the camp (when they first appear), and at Cartman's party in ""[[Imaginationland]]"".

Mark wears a deep green pullover sweater, with a white dress shirt and a black tie underneath, and black slacks. His hair is dark brown and slightly wavy, with a parting in the bangs.
He appears to be the older of the two siblings and is the more outgoing one, curious about what life was like outside their home and eager to explore the public school, wanting to see what other boys were like.

Though he is incredibly intelligent, he was also naive in a few ways; seeming astonished that ""friends"" would call each other names and fight, that the boys seemed to ""like, yet hate"" Pip at the same time, and how the other boys laughed at Kyle for liking Rebecca. Though he was continuously bullied by the others and found himself duct-taped to a bench, he was unconcerned and grew more curious each time.

Despite his parents' objections, he remained eager to explore the outside world and ultimately gave a speech explaining why it was all right for him to stay in public school.

He seems quite protective of his sister, beating Kyle up after seeing what he had inadvertently turned her into, which the other boys then considered him to be ""badass"" for it.

By the end of his debut, he was finding his way into fitting in with the other boys, calling Stan a ""gaywad"" in response to being called ""nerdo"".

Mark the Security Guard,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_the_Security_Guard,,"is a security guard, often partnered with [[Alan the Security Guard|Alan]], who first appears in ""[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]"" and ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"".

In ""[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]"", he first appears with [[Alan the Security Guard]] as watchmen of [[Mt. Peaceful Cemetery]]. They warn [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] about [[Cleo Broflovski]]'s stolen corpse, saying that it had been stolen for the purpose of having sex with it. Unbeknownst to them, [[The Boys|the boys]] had dug it up to scare [[the 6th Graders]]. In addition to warning the townsfolk about the stolen body, he and Alan also go into graphic detail of what necrophilia is and how it is performed.

In ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"", he and Alan are stationed at [[Cheyenne Mountain]]'s military base.

Mark Zuckerberg,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg,,"is the founder and CEO of [[Facebook]]. While Facebook has been parodied and featured in [[South Park]] several times before, Zuckerberg himself did not make an appearance until the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, ""[[Franchise Prequel]]"".

In the episode, ""[[Franchise Prequel]]"", Zuckerberg is invited to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] by the parents of the town. Once he actually visits the town, he proves himself to be of no help or value to them, and becomes a nuisance, pillaging through their homes and lounging around like a couch potato. He later agrees to aid [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in his plan to create fake 'news' about the [[Coon and Friends]] group by making fake posts about them on [[Facebook]], ruining their reputation, and keeping Netflix from green-lighting their superhero franchise.

Later, while he is trespassing into the town, [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] runs around him as [[Fastpass]], providing a distraction for [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], who appears as [[Tupperware]], and fires bursts of energy at him, to which Zuckerberg fires back in his mind but misses every shot. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] then runs up to him as [[Human Kite|the Human Kite]], and punches him in the crotch, sending him to the ground. He is subsequently attacked by all the remaining members of the [[Coon and Friends]]. Zuckerberg stands up, and the [[Coon and Friends]] dramatically fall to the ground. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] then appears as [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]], and tells all the town citizens watching that Zuckerberg had attacked innocent children who were simply trying to save black lives, and simultaneously support Jews, and crippled people. Zuckerberg is thwarted by the [[Coon and Friends]] and is forced to take down [[Facebook]], ruining [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]]'s plan.

He is an adult male ginger with a pale face, wide staring eyes, and rosey red cheeks. He wears a gray shirt and jeans. He has a robotic, artificial voice, that notably does not align with his lip syncing - sounding poorly 'dubbed', like a character from a 1970's kung-fu movie.

Zuckerberg is petulant, immature, and acts entitled to everything. He seems lost in his imagination, challenging people to ""block him"", mocking them about their style (which he pronounces ""shtoile""), and launching imaginary balls of energy at them in his mind. He is also extremely disrespectful towards the privacy of others, invading the homes of people in South Park against their will, arrogantly believing he has a right to infringe upon the space of others, which is clearly a criticism of his Facebook practises being intrusive of its user's privacy.

Marklar,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Marklar,,"are an intelligent species of identical aliens who refer to all people, places, and things as ""Marklar"".

They first appeared in the episode ""[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]"". In which during the episode, a single Marklar visited Earth, specifically on Ethiopia, and attempted to make first contact with lions, but was subsequently killed. His spaceship was found by [[Starvin' Marvin (Character)|Starvin' Marvin]], who used it, with help from [[The Boys|the boys]], to bring his people a new home on the Marklar's home world in order to escape from Christian missionaries, who are intent on converting the Ethiopians to their faith.

Marvin Marsh,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Marvin_Marsh,,"is [[Stan Marsh]]'s paternal grandfather and is voiced by [[Trey Parker]], who also provides the voices for both his [[Randy Marsh|son]], and his grandson. He is a member of the [[Hare Club for Men]] and tries to persuade Stan to kill him on a regular basis. He made his first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Death]]"".

He has dementia, which is characterized primarily by memory loss and refers to Stan as 'Billy' as a result.

In ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", he lost his license and drove without one and was arrested by Officer Barbrady.
*'''Escaping Jail:''' In ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", he escaped jail with help from his friends from the [[American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)]].
*'''Murder:''' In ""[[Death]]"", it is revealed that he killed his grandfather because he told him to do it.

Despite generally being seen living with his family, Marvin has seldom spoken in episodes in which he is not a prominent character, usually remaining quiet. His presence with the family was maintained, however, with mentions of his extra wheelchair in ""[[Bloody Mary]]"" and of him being in the bathtub in ""[[Pandemic]]"". He also still appeared at family dinners into [[Season Twelve]], after which he disappeared from the home. In ""[[Cash For Gold]]"", we see he has been moved into Looming Sunset Assisted Living retirement center, explaining his recent absences.

Though he is a member of the Marsh family, who have seen increasing use in recent seasons, he has virtually disappeared from the show in recent years, appearing briefly in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"" in [[Season Eleven]], before finally having a major role in ""[[Cash For Gold]]"".

In the episode ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", Marvin Marsh revealed that he worked 55 years in a steel mill. In World War II, he flew a Spitfire over [[Germany|Nazi Germany]], a reference to one of the four groups of United States Army Air Forces stationed in the [[United Kingdom]] and the Mediterranean equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire, a British single-seat fighter. Alternatively, Marvin might be referring to the Eagle Squadrons: Royal Air Force squadrons made up of American volunteers prior to the US's entry into the Second World War that also operated the Spitfire.

In his first appearance, ""[[Death]]"", Marvin Marsh desperately wants to die simply because he is bored with life. After his own failed attempt at suicide, he turns to Stan to do the job for him. Stan approaches various people for advice on the matter, but all are unwilling to answer. When Grampa Marsh eventually does convince Stan to kill him, [[Death (Character)|Death]]'s sudden appearance foils the plan because he was actually looking for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], not Marvin. Death points into the light where Grampa Marsh's own grandfather, who refers to Marvin as ""Billy"", whom Marvin had killed when he was a boy, convinces him to wait for death by natural causes.

For several following episodes such as ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", Grampa Marsh carries a noose or on one occasion, encouraged a soldier to shoot him, but the gag ended in [[Season Four]] after ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"" and he has made no suicide attempts since.

In ""[[Cash For Gold]]"", Marvin no longer has a suicidal attitude but rather is reminiscing about the past, such as his border collie dog, named Patches.

In the episode ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", Grampa and the rest of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'s elderly residents were angered when their driving licenses are taken away after their bad driving had killed a number of people. He started a movement to let the elderly keep their licenses, but it ultimately failed. He was later caught driving without his license, which had been previously taken away, and he was arrested. However, he was soon rescued by the AARP, whom he teamed up with to regain rights for senior citizens, who start randomly killing any non-senior citizen they came across. After a brief period of complete control of South Park, and plans to overtake the entire country, his group was thwarted when the four boys locked them out of the [[Country Kitchen Buffet]], their only source of food. The group eventually surrendered and life returned to normal.

Marvin wears a dark red sweater and black trousers. He has wrinkles on his face, has age spots, and has gray hair. He is also confined to a wheel-chair, although this may just be because he is lazy, he sometimes has a purple blanket on his legs. In the episodes ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"", ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", and ""[[Hummels & Heroin]]"", he is able to stand up and walk unaided.

[[File:Marvin'sGrandfather.transparent.billy.png|thumb|Marvin's grandfather]]
Inconsistently, he has been referred to as both Stan's maternal and paternal grandfather. As the series progressed, though, he was more heavily implied to be Randy's father, sharing his surname as well. This is backed up even further in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", where Randy states his family has been in a society which has guarded the secret about Easter for generations. Grampa Marsh is shown to be a member of this exclusive club. In ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"", he refers to Randy as an unwanted son; he claims he never wanted children, and that Stan's father was ""supposed to be nothing but dried-up crust on Gram Gram's titties.""

However, in the episode, ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"", Sheila asks Sharon, looking at Marvin, who is an employee at the store, ""[[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]], isn't that your father?"", to which Sharon replies ""Yes."" This could be a simple continuity error, or it could mean that Sharon sees Marvin to be as close to her as her own father.

He often addresses Stan as ""Billy"", to which Stan will angrily tell him that he is not named ""Billy"". This name confusion appears to be genetic, as the ghost of Stan's great-great-grandfather called his grandson ""Billy"" instead of ""Marvin"" in the episode ""[[Death]]"". Marvin is revealed to have killed his grandfather at the latter's request, Death shows the ghost of the latter. Great-great Grandpa Marsh revealed that after death, he was punished and forced to spend eternity in limbo and advises Marvin to wait for natural causes.

He also has been shown on multiple occasions calling people a ""pompous son-of-a-whore"" in various situations.

In the episode ""[[Death]]"", he is revealed to have just turned 102 years of age. In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", Randy's age is confirmed to be 42, meaning Grampa would have been sixty at his birth.

[[File:1602patches.png|thumb|A younger Marvin with his dog Patches.]]
[[Grandma Marsh]] was introduced in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"". Due to the fact that Grandpa Marsh does not live with his wife and because he once had a sexual encounter with a contortionist in ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"", this would imply that he and his wife are divorced.

In ""[[Cash For Gold]]"", Marvin was shown to be living in a retirement home when he was visited by Randy and his family. This implies that sometime between ""[[Pandemic]]"" and ""[[Cash For Gold]]"", Marvin moved out of the [[Marsh Residence]]. In this episode, his love for his family, especially his grandchildren is greatly reinforced. It is also shown that he once had a border collie dog named Patches, which he is shown to reminisce about often.

Mayor McDaniels,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mayor_McDaniels,,"is the mayor of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. She made her first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", and still continues to make prominent appearances.

</gallery>

When [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] created the character of Mayor McDaniels, they wanted her to be a sophisticated and egotistical person as heard on the ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"" commentary for [[South Park: The Complete First Season]]. She can be seen to fit this description, often being stubborn and sticking by her own decisions extensively.

Despite her normal manner, after the music festival in ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"" got out of control, the Mayor attempted suicide after saying, ""What have I done?"" and shooting herself in the head. However, she is seen to have survived in the same episode with a blood-stained bandage around her head. She has since returned to her regular personality and is the go-to official when matters affect South Park or when a political representative for the town is needed for an episode.

She wears a blue jacket and green trousers. She also wears gold earrings. Her hair is turquoise-blue, and her lips are rather thin.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', her hair has completely whitened. She wears a blue jacket with gold buttons, a green skirt, and black sandals. She also wears a pair of square-framed glasses.
[[File:13a.jpg|thumb|left|The Mayor on South Park Studios]]
The Mayor often acts like she is better than everyone else, most likely because she attended Princeton University. She also thinks South Park is a dump, as mentioned in several episodes. She tries to show that she has changed the town around, although, in reality, she is highly inactive. Though she occasionally seems like a relatively normal politician, she was happy to join [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], [[Jimbo]], and others in cannibalism by eating [[Eric Roberts]] and the rest of a cast and crew from Hollywood who came to film a re-enactment of the shooting of [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]].

She once left the microphone on when [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] was giving out the prize for the best environmental essay and was overheard shouting she was ""stuck in this stupid town with all these rednecks"". Highly ambitious, it has been suggested she only became Mayor as a gateway to a higher political office in Colorado.

In the earlier seasons of the show, it was implied that Mayor McDaniels was either a closeted lesbian or bisexual. In ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", she was seen at the [[City Hall]], in bed wearing a mudpack while reading a porn magazine called ""''Gazunga's''"", which had a busty woman on the cover. As the series progressed, the concept of bisexuality became more likely, as she has had a few relationships with women and men.
[[File:Screen Shot 2017-10-03 at 10.21.02 pm.png|thumb|Mayor McDaniels' loved one who passed away, perhaps her husband.]]
In ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"" it is implied that she may have lost a loved one in the past as there is a picture of a man on her desk that she holds to her chest and she is later seen visiting a gravestone, it may have been her husband.

Amongst the mixed implications of her sexuality, [[Officer Barbrady]] is implied to have had sexual relations with her in some episodes with questionable behavior in her office, though it is deliberately ambiguous and mainly with implication. Indeed, the South Park Studios biography states that; ""she and Officer Barbrady go looking for men nightly.""

The Mayor is always followed by her two aides. They have a very similar appearance and often make plans for which McDaniels inevitably takes credit. Part of their names are both revealed in ""[[Volcano]]""; one is referred to as [[Ted]], who has a mustache. The other, [[Johnson]], does not. Both of their names are taken from NFL player Ted Johnson, who used to play for New England Patriots.

In ""[[Volcano]]"", Mayor fires [[Johnson]] for exposing her lack of common sense. Surprisingly, Johnson accepts with pleasure, which indicates a bad relationship between him and the Mayor. In later episodes, Johnson is rehired.

In ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"", Ted helps the boys to escape from the homeless people when they get too high in number, but due to a car accident, he is killed. In ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"", [[Janson|another man]], in a suit similar to Johnson's, is seen with the Mayor and Johnson various times.

Mayor McDaniels plays a minor role in the game. She can be found at [[City Hall]] and gives the player the [[The Homeless Problem|side quest]] of beating up all the homeless people in town.

She turns on her television to show another mayor giving a speech about their use of the word, saying that the word ""fag"" is still officially defined as a pejorative term against homosexuals in the dictionary and saying that South Park is out of touch with the progressive world. This enrages Mayor McDaniels, as her rival is gaining more support than her.

She also makes a brief cameo appearance in ""[[Where My Country Gone?]]"", where she can be seen sitting to the left of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] in [[Mr. Stkrdknmibalz]]'s language class.

Randy gives himself testicular cancer that made his balls grow into huge proportions, such as he could obtain marijuana legally. His balls eventually grew so large that he could not fit through the door of the marijuana store, with the clerk asserting that he is not permitted to sell marijuana outside of the store.

This eventually led to a protest involving other men with huge testicles. The clerk watches the men protest outside the store, commenting that many people are abusing the medicinal system, and that pot should have been made legal altogether.

The Medicinal Fried Chicken clerk has balding brown hair. He wears a lab coat over a pink shirt with gray patterns, and blue pants.

Mel Gibson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mel_Gibson,,"is an American actor and film director, known for roles in films such as ''Braveheart'' and ''The Patriot'', and for his movie ''The Passion of the Christ''. He is depicted in ''[[South Park]]'' as utterly and violently insane, lacking any reason or sanity. He first appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode, ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"".

Gibson is featured prominently in ""[[The Passion of the Jew]]"", in which [[the boys]] see ''The Passion of the Christ''. In the episodes prior to ""The Passion of the Jew"", [[Eric Cartman]] continues to make assorted disparaging remarks towards [[Kyle Broflovski]] about being Jewish, while citing the ''The Passion of the Christ'' as justification. Finally fed up, Kyle goes to see the film, and is horrified by how bloody and vicious [[Jesus Christ]]'s death was. Completely shaken in his Jewish beliefs, Kyle concedes that Cartman is right in his opinions. Seeing this as a sign, Cartman goes on to believe that the film was Mel Gibson's way of rallying people against the Jews, and idolizes him for it. As such, Cartman recreates the Nazi party, under the guise of the ""Mel Gibson Fan Club"".

[[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kenny McCormick]], on the other hand, after watching the film, are disgusted, seeing it not as a film masterpiece as so many have claimed, but rather a ""snuff film"" that completely sucked. They demand their money back, but the ticket guy snidely tells them that the only person who can give it to them is the film's producer, Mel Gibson himself. Infuriated by the movie and the ticket guy's attitude, Stan and Kenny go to Gibson's house in Malibu, only to discover that he is a religious zealot and is obsessed with prompting strangers to torture him. Stan and Kenny introduce themselves to Gibson and explain they did not like the movie and they wanted a refund. He then replies by saying that they cannot not like ''The Passion'' and that he just followed the Bible. Stan and Kenny still follow him into his house and insist that he gives them their money. He then replies by stripping himself to his underwear and locking himself up on a table and tells them they can torture him all they want, but that he still would not give them their ticket money. After Stan called him daffy, he threatens them with a pistol, running around acting like the old Daffy Duck cartoons, all the while demanding that they torture him. While running for their lives, Stan and Kenny find and steal the 18 dollars from his wallet and escape. Gibson only had a twenty dollar bill, so Stan and Kenny put two dollars back in the wallet. Gibson, however, chases them back to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] in a truck still stripped in his underwear, where he begins to demand the whole town to torture him, all while Cartman praises him, asking for approval. Gibson pays no mind to Cartman or his group, instead becoming angered when nobody tortured him and says ""if nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my 18 dollars,"" but is angered once more when Stan told him that it was their 18 dollars and once again told him his movie sucked. He angrily tells Stan and Kenny that saying his movie sucked is like saying Christianity sucks. Stan counters this argument by saying that Christianity is fine, but focusing on how Jesus Christ died ends up with really bad results, convincing the town that Mel Gibson was wrong all along. Cartman seems somewhat disillusioned in Gibson, after Gibson gleefully defecates on his face.

In ""[[Imaginationland]]"", the United States government requests the help of Hollywood directors in coming up with ideas on how to fight the terrorists of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]]. Unfortunately, their first two attempts with [[Michael Bay]] and [[M. Night Shyamalan]] prove to be unsuccessful as neither understands plot, but rather special effects and movie 'twists'. Gibson, however, despite still being completely insane, proves to have a good understanding of plot, as he suggests that the government look at video footage from Imaginationland, and see if there is someone who does not belong there.

Gibson appears again, still in his underwear, in a cameo role in ""[[200]]"", in which [[Tom Cruise]] organized 200 celebrities, in filing a class-action lawsuit against the town of South Park for years of mockery and abuse. It is revealed however that the celebrities actually only want South Park to give them the Muslim Prophet [[Muhammad]], so they can steal his power of not being ridiculed. He does not speak however.

Mel Gibson can usually be seen with a painted face wearing nothing but a pair of white briefs underwear. Before stripping, he wears a dark blue collared shirt.

Gibson is portrayed as being utterly insane and disturbed, lacking in any reason and reacting violently to even the slightest criticism of his antics. He is shown to be an intense Sadomasochist, with a particular preference for his nipples being squeezed. However, despite his mental imbalance, he is shown to be surprisingly intelligent and perceptive, as he was the only individual to work out the truth about Imaginationland to the FBI, with his sound advice being of great help to their investigation.

In ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"", Michael helps [[The South Park Diggities|Stan's dance team]] out to be the biggest non-conformist of all by not even conforming to goth standards. He also suggests bringing [[Yao]] and a girl (who ends up being [[Mercedes]], a [[Raisins]] Girl) into the group.

Michael reappears in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"" being mistaken for a [[South Park Vampire Society|Vampire kid]]. The Goth Kids kidnap [[Mike Makowski]] (the head Vampire Kid) and suggest ramming a stake through his heart, but end up sending him to Scottsdale, Arizona instead.

Michael appears in ""[[T.M.I.]]"" in the anger management class with several other people. He may have a small penis, as he goes to an anger management class with other people who have anger issues due to their penis size.

[[File:TheUngroundable082.png|thumb|Michael and the Goth Kids burning down ""Hot Topic"".]]
The Goth Kids have collectively and individually engaged in numerous criminal offenses.

Michael is the vocalist in the Goth Kids' band. Their only known song was ""[[Talent Shows are for Fags]]"", which was played ironically at the [[South Park Elementary Talent Show]] in the episode ""[[Erection Day]]"".

[[File:Tallgoth.png|left|thumb]]
Michael walks with a brown stiff cane, with the fact he is an Edwardian Goth; however, sometimes he is seen walking without it, even once giving it to Stan in ""[[Raisins]]"" and tossing it aside while running in ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"". He is taller than the other kids and has curly black hair parted on the right. He has a large nose that is visible along with his ears, unlike most children in South Park and has black eyeliner under his eyes.

In ""[[Pajama Day]]"", he is seen wearing a dark-grey, button-up nightgown, a sleeping cap, and black slippers. He also holds a black pillow with a skull and a candle.

Michael is possibly half-Asian and half-Caucasian, because in ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"", it is revealed that he has an Asian mother and Caucasian father. However, she could be his stepmother because in the episode ""[[Raisins]]"", he states out ""Love didn't work out for my mom and dad, so why should it work out for me?"", suggesting that his biological parents were divorced. However, it could be an angsty exaggeration, similar to how Henrietta claims that her mother ""abuses"" her.

Michael appears with the rest of the Goth kids. The player can try and recruit him and the rest of the goth kids through the quest ''PTA Problems''. The player is also able to friend him on Facebook.

Michael and the other Goth Kids can be found in [[Henrietta's Bedroom]]. The New Kid is required to complete a ritual in the room before they can take a selfie.

He reappears in the continuation ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"" where he personally confronts the boys and reveals his true form as the Guinea Pirate, leader of the Furry Death.

Michael Deets,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Deets,,"was a serial killer who featured as the main antagonist in the [[Season Eight]] episode, ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"".

Deets murdered and removed the left hands of several people throughout the episode, including the school bus driver [[Veronica Crabtree]]. It is unknown as to how he chose his victims. When questioned, he would state that he had been molested by a mannequin, whom he claimed was his mother. No one except [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] suspected him of the murders, and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s false visions caused other people to be wrongly arrested instead.

Eventually, he grew tired of not being ""credited"" for his murders and proceeded to abduct Cartman from his home, hold him captive in his house, and force him to watch a slideshow of places he's been to. Soon thereafter, several police officers, led by [[Harrison Yates|Sergeant Yates]], appear at his doorstep in order to continue an investigation into the recent string of murders. After identifying himself as ""God"", Deets allows the officers to enter his house. Yates and the others fail to take note of anything suspicious until they come across Deets' collection of severed left hands - which he subsequently dismisses as being a completely innocent collection of severed ''right'' hands.

After considerable examination and evaluation of the evidence before him, and forgetting what it was he was supposed to be doing, Yates realizes that what he believed was right hands were, in fact, left hands placed the opposite way. Acting on this revelation, Yates returns to Deets' house just in time to prevent him from killing Cartman. Deets leaps out at the police officers with a knife but is shot dead. Yates then proceeded to shoot him in the head a few additional times.

He has bags under his eyes. He is excessively hairy. When he was at the sight of his murders, he was clad in a blood-splattered raincoat and yellow underwear. In other places, he wore yellow underwear, a green cap that had a pistol logo at its center, and a red robe. His hair is presumably blond as his eyebrows are seen being blond.

He is shown to be extremely mentally unstable and disturbed, killing people and collecting their left hands. He often stated that he had been molested by a mannequin, whom he claimed was his mother. He also claimed he was God. If he was truly molested by his mother, then the psychological trauma associated with sexual abuse may have caused his mental imbalance.

In ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", after years of being targeted by the police, Jackson moves to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] into what is said to be ""The Donovans' Old Residence"" with his son, [[Blanket Jackson]]. Michael hopes that he can escape the police's constant attempts at framing him for child molestation. When Blanket makes friends with [[the boys]], Jackson quickly steals them for himself, in his continued attempts at regaining his lost childhood, often at the neglect of his own son. Jackson is quickly targeted by the [[Park County Police Force]], upon discovering that a rich black man had moved to town.

His new home in South Park is similar to his Neverland Ranch, as he has various expensive things including a cotton candy machine, arcade games, an amusement park, a train that children can ride, and even a small zoo in his backyard. He seems most fond however of his 'wishing tree' in which he climbs into and sings.

[[File:Jefferson (6).png||thumb|180px|Michael swinging with [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]].]]
Though talented, he is extremely childish, irresponsible, and delusional, playing with various children's toys, living in a fantasy world as well as neglecting his parental responsibilities in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"". He also saw no problem with sleeping in the same bed as young children that were not his children, despite the obvious inappropriate nature of such a situation. He also refused to accept his death in ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"", even going as far as to possess [[Ike Broflovski]] in order to participate in a little girls' talent show.

In ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"", Michael refuses to accept his death, causing himself and other celebrities who died during [[Season Thirteen]] to be trapped in [[Purgatory]]. Michael Jackson then possessed [[Ike Broflovski]], so the boys had to help him live his dream of being a little white girl in order to banish his ghost from Ike's body. After Michael Jackson won a beauty pageant, in Ike's body, he accepted his death. He and the other celebrities were able to leave purgatory. Michael Jackson presumably now resides in [[Hell]]. He, however, was shown in the crowd of angry celebrities in ""[[200]]"". It is likely he returned to Earth, as people are able to return to Earth from Hell, as shown in ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"".

In the episode ""[[The Jeffersons]]"", he sports a fake mustache (so no one can realize that he is Michael Jackson). Towards the end of the episode, however, Jackson's appearance begins to become mutilated, as his face begins to fall apart and melt, causing him to become skeletal and zombie-like. He goes on to wear the red jumpsuit from his music video ""Thriller.""

At the end of ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"", he is shown wearing the formal outfit he wore during the 1984 Grammy Awards.

Michael appears in ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'', where he is known as ""Corey Haim"". Upon appearing from the portal conjured by [[Mr. Adams|Master Vampire Adams]], he proceeds to grab [[Karen McCormick|Karen]] and dive down the cliff waterfall inside [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]], forcing [[the New Kid]] to give chase by diving down the cliff as well.

Corey is then seen later at the ground-level dining floor after The New Kid emerges from the wishing well inside Casa Bonita, engaging The New Kid, [[Henrietta Biggle|Henrietta]], [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] and [[Mysterion]] into combat.

In his second full-length documentary ''Bowling for Columbine'', Moore interviewed Matt Stone and Trey Parker regarding Colorado's social climate, as the two grew up in Littleton, CO, to gain more insight on the conditions that shaped Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine Massacre students. Though they gave Moore an honest interview and considered their cuts in the movie as fair, they remain on rocky terms with Moore due to him commissioning a South Park style animation bit before their interview, and made without the consent of either of them; the short was that of a bit showcasing KKK related crimes and atrocities due to associations with the NRA. Matt Stone alleges that the short created mistakenly gives the impression that both of them created it themselves, and remain strained with him, calling Moore a filmmaker who cooks context and creates bias through cutting together his films as to provide truth for a one-sided agenda.

Moore is grossly overweight with a turkey neck and his gut hanging out. He wears a fern green baseball cap, glasses, a black T-shirt, blue jeans, and gray shoes, and he wields a blue and gray megaphone.

He made his first cameo in a sketch with him having a large erection from [[Mitch Murphy]] in ""[[Eek, A Penis!]]"". He later physically appeared in the uncut DVD movie version of ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"", being attacked and killed by the evil imaginary characters. During ""[[The Ring]]"", his main motive with the Jonas Brothers was to ""sell sex"" to young, innocent girls with sex euphemisms to ""stupid"" Christian families.

At the end of the episode, Mickey is shown giving himself magically to have the ability to grow in size, breathe fire, and fly. He is seen hovering over the city in anger while he mimics the Mickey Mouse balloon seen in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. It is implied that Mickey might be of some sort of divine origin. A news reporter on the scene, commenting on Mickey's onslaught mentions that Mickey would afterward return to Valhalla, of Norse mythology, where he would then slumber and feed.

Mickey has once seen again in the ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"" duologue series with the celebrities who were suing [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]; he had a speaking part in ""[[201]]"" where he is one of the many celebrities and gingers arguing who gets to go into the goo machine and later on fights against the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]].

Mickey reappears in ""[[Obama Wins!]]"" and is still in control of the Disney Corporation. Thrilled at the redemption of the ''[[List of Star Wars References|Star Wars]]'' franchise, he schemes with [[Eric Cartman]] to get [[Mitt Romney]] elected President of the [[United States]] by making him have a cameo in future ''Star Wars'' movies.

Mickey reappears in ""[[Band in China]]"" where he scolds major Marvel, Star Wars, and other Disney characters he owns for pissing off the Chinese government as it's their biggest market for income, he even disowns [[Winnie the Pooh]] because the Chinese consider him offensive. He later teams up with [[Randy Marsh]] and fails to convince the Chinese to allow Randy to sell [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] weed in China, even developing a liking towards it. He then states that they need to show the Chinese that they should understand what it means to be made fun of and, presumably, orders Randy to kill Winnie the Pooh, causing the Chinese to allow Randy to sell his weed in China.

Mickey appears in ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"" where there were more revealed details of what happened with him and Randy in China back in ""Band in China"" (which includes having sex with a [[bat]] and a [[pangolin]]). During the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, Mickey has problems with stabilizing Disney without failing and getting bankrupt while getting angry at Randy for doing the sexual activity. He sends a live human heart to Randy as a deadly threat after Randy admits that he may have caused the COVID-19 crisis. He plans to have him killed and take his DNA to the vaccines while calling him in a deserted [[Disneyland]] about the threat.

Mickey's first appearance is more accurate compared to his Disney version, with him being a black mouse with a tan area near his eyes as well as his snout area, purple gold buttoned shorts, white gloves, and floppy yellow shoes. His design is revised in ""[[The Ring]]"", as he is given a white ""dress"" shirt, red tie, and large brown shoes that replace his yellow shoes worn before, he is also given the regular eyes that ''South Park'' characters have as opposed to his former oval eyes.
Although he is portrayed as a good character in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"", he is depicted as cruel and cold-hearted starting in ""[[The Ring]]"". In this episode, Mickey is given a more prominent role, where he is seen as the owner of the Disney Company and boss to the [[Jonas Brothers]]. Mickey is portrayed as an evil money-hungry, a foul-mouthed corporate mogul who is both verbally and physically abusive to his employees; even other Disney characters (including those from Marvel Studios and Star Wars) all fear him in general. For example, when Joe Jonas states that he would quit doing his work about the [[Purity Ring|purity rings]], Mickey punches Joe in the balls and begins kicking his face as he fell, then forcing him to get up and agree to his statement. In the same episode, Mickey appears to be insanely threatening with wanting to kill [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]], and Jonas Brothers with a chainsaw to prevent them from ruining his concert. Another example is when Thor states that the Chinese government is exploiting their people through labor, Mickey angrily orders Thor to shut up. It should be noted that Mickey says his trademark ''""Ha-ha!""'' chuckle at the end of most of his sentences, which in context, it comes off like a nervous tic since he does this even when he is enraged.

Millennials Against Canada,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Millennials_Against_Canada,,"is an anti-Canadian organization formed by [[Kyle Broflovski]] in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode ""[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"".

Kyle decides to form the group, believing that [[Canada]] (particularly [[Terrance and Phillip]]) is responsible in bringing about a bad influence to the [[United States]]. This is in addition to his changing reception with Terrance and Phillip's show, along with instances of being compared to [[Sheila Broflovski|his mother]] by several characters in the episode.

Members of the group are seen disrupting a shooting of the ''Terrance & Phillip Show'' to further their cause, eventually working their way up to the [[White House]]. Upon hearing Kyle's plea, [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] reacts by sending a nuke to Canada.

Millie Larsen,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Millie_Larsen,,"is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth-grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"", and made her first speaking role in the [[Season Five]] episode, ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"". She speaks with a strong Southern accent in some episodes, mainly in the newer ones. In the [[Season Nine]] episode, ""[[Erection Day]]"", [[Red McArthur]] briefly referred to her as ""Jessie"", but this was likely a simple continuity error. Millie is displayed as one of ""the popular girls"" in [[The 4th Grade|the fourth grade]] along with [[Wendy Testaburger]], [[Bebe Stevens]], Red, [[Lola]], [[Esther]], [[Heidi Turner]], [[Annie Knitts]], and [[Sally Turner]].

Millie likes to sing and dance, as shown in ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"". She also likes to bake, as shown in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"". Her first speaking role was in ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"", where she told her mom to ''""look at the little black lion.""''

In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", she, along with Bebe, Annie, and Red, act as groupies for [[Fingerbang]]'s makeshift music video. In ""[[Marjorine]]"", she was invited to Heidi's slumber party with Marjorine and the others. She was cruel to Marjorine, as were the other girls. 
In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", she was dressed as a whore, along with all of the [[List of Female 4th Graders|fourth-grade girls]] (excluding [[Wendy Testaburger]]).

In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", she had a crush on [[Bridon Gueermo]], stating that he was ''""a dream""''. In her speaking roles in earlier seasons, Millie has a southern accent, although in the later seasons, it is less noticeable. She usually hangs out with Wendy, Bebe, Red, Annie, Esther, Lola, and Sally. During lunch, she can usually be seen sitting at the ""popular girls"" table.

In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", she, Esther, Wendy, and Red were shown gossiping about Bebe, due to her newfound popularity among the [[List of Male 4th Graders|male fourth-grade students]]. In ""[[The List]]"", she was shown to be a member of the list making a committee.

She wears a sea-green jacket with lime trim and black trousers. Under her jacket, she is shown to wear a pink tee-shirt. She also wears pigtails, tied by lime scrunchies, in her strawberry-blonde hair. As a ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"", she wore a green jupatterned mpsuit with cutouts on the sides of the waist, salmon eye shadow and black mascara. In ""[[Marjorine]]"", at [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]'s sleepover party, she wore a pair of light green and lime plaid pajamas.
[[File:Millie funnybot png.png|thumb]]
Millie is a ""popular girl"", therefore it is likely she has no problem conforming to the popular fad. An example of this would be her appearance in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", where she was shown as a ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"", along with all the other girls. Another example of her conformity would be in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", where she was shown singing and dancing along with the rest of [[The 4th Grade|the fourth-grade]] populace. Although, as evidenced by the end of the episode, her conformity in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"" was most likely due to her crush on [[Bridon Gueermo]]. Due to her relatively minor speaking roles, the only other thing that can be accurately assumed is her love of Matt Lauer, as shown in ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"".

Millie seems to have a family, however, they were only shown once together in one of the earlier seasons. 

[[File:Millie'sMotherAndSister.png|thumb|Milly's sister and mother, seen in ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"".]]
Her mother has short blond hair, wears a pink long-sleeved shirt and dark pinkish-red pants with black shoes. Not much else is known about her or their relationship with her children. Millie's father has so far, not been seen.

[[File:Millie larsen 2.png|thumb|Millie being given her cat in ""[[201]]""]]
Millie is seen being given a cat by a fireman at the end of the episode ""[[201]]"". It is most likely that it is her cat.

[[Flora]] was seen with Millie and her mother her in ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"". However, in ""[[Trapper Keeper]]"", Flora's last name was revealed to be ""Neal"", however, Flora's last name was given as Larsen in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', so Flora's last name is now Larsen, thus, making Millie as Flora's sister.

In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"". Millie, along with all the other girls had a crush on Bridon.

Millie is usually seen sitting with the ""popular"" girls at lunch. She is a part of the popular girls ""clique"".

[[File:Mille STOT.png|thumb]]
Millie can be found behind a building, in which [[the New Kid]] have to destroy a snowman to get to her and befriend her. It is revealed that she smokes. Upon the player's first meeting with the girls, [[Lola]] allows Millie to speak. She proposes the group address an issue with [[Monica Ryland|Monica]] but is interrupted by [[Annie Knitts|Annie]].

Mimsy,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mimsy,,"is a mentally handicapped student at [[South Park Elementary|South Park Elementary.]] He is [[Nathan]]'s henchman in the episodes ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", ""[[Handicar]]"" and ""[[Moss Piglets]]"".

When [[Jimmy Valmer]] and [[Timmy]] return to [[Lake Tardicaca]], a camp for handicapped children, Jimmy unknowingly finds himself to be targeted by his former-drug dealer and leader of the Red Camp Game team, [[Nathan]], who has developed a great dislike for Jimmy due to the fact that Jimmy has led the Blue camp team to victory 3 years running. Aiding Nathan is Mimsy, a big, strong, but dimwitted lackey, who inadvertently causes all of Nathan's plans aimed at defeating the Blue team and killing Jimmy, to backfire.

Nathan's first plan is to put a Black Mamba snake into the Blue Team's canoe. However, his orders to Mimsy are ""Put the snake in the canoe"", making Mimsy assume that Nathan meant for him to put the snake in their team's canoe, rather than Jimmy's. Similar errors involve a map leading to an Indian reservation, whose Indians kill on sight during the Scavenger Hunt, a shark-mating whistle during the surfing competition (that results in Nathan being raped by a shark), and an exploding ukulele.

Mimsy has small messy brown hair. In addition to his mental handicap, he appears to have [[wikipedia:strabismus|strabismus]] in both eyes. He is overweight to the point of his shirt not being able to fit over his stomach. He wears the standard [[Lake Tardicaca]] uniform, a red t-shirt emblazoned with the Lake Tardicaca logo near the right sleeve, and brown pants. Outside of camp, he wears a white button-up shirt and brown suit. He talks in a New Jersey-esque accent. 

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Mimsy appears as an adult man. He wears a light blue tracksuit and a gold necklace, similar to Nathan. He is also balding and has an extremely large, square chin. 
[[File:Nathan_&_Mimsy.png|thumb|Nathan and Mimsy in ""Black Friday"".]]
Mimsy is extremely unintelligent due to his mental handicap. He often messes up [[Nathan]]'s schemes unless Nathan explains them in extreme detail. His lack of intelligence makes him easy to manipulate, as showcased by his loyalty to [[Nathan]], who commonly puts him in dangerous or illegal situations. In ""[[Handicar]]"", he seems to be able to occasionally come up with reasonable ideas, only to be ignored by Nathan, who always responds by slapping him and shouting, ""Shut up, Mimsy!"".


Mimsy appears as a boss along with [[Nathan]] in the DLC ''[[Bring the Crunch]]''.

and he was sent to earth to stop evil from taking over Earth. His power of mint and berries (""yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch"") are the result of a collision between his home planet and the world of intense mint flavor.

In the [[:Category:Superheroes Saga|Superhero Arc]], Mintberry Crunch is a member of [[Coon and Friends]], a superhero group led by [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]]. He initially appears to be an entirely ineffectual member of the group, with the powers of a breakfast cereal mascot, to the confusion of the other members. In ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", the Coon brutally assaults Mintberry Crunch and [[Mosquito]] in an attempt to consolidate his influence in the group. However, he is unanimously voted out of the group instead.

[[File:CoonVsCoonAndFriendsPromo2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coon and Friends]] bear witness to [[Cthulhu]].]]In ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", as the group is congregated in the basement of Cartman's house, Cartman returns home and lures them out with the promise of witnessing a ""double rainbow"". However, it is revealed that [[Cthulhu]], recently released from an inter-dimensional portal in the Gulf of Mexico, is working for Cartman. At the sight of Cthulhu, Mintberry Crunch quickly runs away, leaving the other Coon and Friends to deal with the problem themselves. Having escaped from danger, he returns home to ""heroically"" watch Judge Judy, while the other members of the group are sent to [[City of R'Lyeh|an alternate dimension]] by Cthulhu.

Meanwhile, after successfully escaping the pocket dimension by committing suicide, [[Mysterion]] visits [[Henrietta Biggle|Bradley's sister]] and her friends, the [[Goth Kids]]. Bradley unexpectedly finds him in Henrietta's room when he asks to play with her and her friends. Upon seeing Mysterion, Bradley re-adopts his superhero persona and joins Mysterion in his quest to stop Cthulhu and find out how mint and berries came together to deliver full flavor in an intense crunch.
[[File:CoonvsCoonandFriends51.png|thumb|left|Gokzarah's real father, from the planet [[Kokujon]], explains Mintberry Crunch's true origin.]]
As Mysterion confronts Cthulhu, a bright light unexpectedly appears and a holographic representation of an alien begins to explain the shocking truth of Mintberry Crunch's origin. The alien man reveals that Bradley's true name is Gokzarah, and that he was originally from the planet [[Kokujon]]. The alien man then implores him to use his powers to save the Earth. Following this revelation, Mintberry Crunch begins to manifest real superpowers, and uses them to defeat Cthulhu and save the other members of Coon and Friends from R'lyeh.

At the conclusion of the arc, Mintberry Crunch announces that he must go out into the universe in order to find answers to the many questions that remain, and leaves in a flash of light and cereal, promising to return someday.

In ''South Park: The Fractured But Whole'', Mintberry Crunch returns as an ally in ''[[Bring the Crunch]]'' alongside [[Fastpass]], [[Doctor Timothy]], [[Professor Chaos]], and [[The New Kid]] to investigate the disappearance of the [[Lake Tardicaca]] camp counselors. After fighting some costumed criminals hired by [[Nathan]] and [[Mimsy]], an alien enemy named Zarganor arrives at the camp after following Mintberry Crunch's mint trail across the galaxy, he kidnaps the last counselor. He then deceives The New Kid into delivering him skim milk - Mintberry Crunch's weakness, to give him his powers. Next he begins mind controlling Doctor Timothy's powers to cause chaos to the camp. After being defeated, Mintberry Crunch explains that Zarganor's family were once slaves to his family on his home planet, having to work in the berry mines and harvesting cotton berries, which fueled the hatred of Zarganor's species toward's Mintberry Crunch's freedom. He then departs to his home world. 

[[File:Bradley.png|thumb|right|[[Bradley Biggle]], Mintberry Crunch's real identity.]]
His true identity is revealed in the episode ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"". Crunch is actually an alien from a faraway planet: [[Kokujon]], known throughout the universe for its berry mines - berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. In a holographic message from his extraterrestrial father, Crunch learns that his name is actually '''Gokzarah''' and he was sent to earth to stop evil from taking over Earth. His power of mint and berries (""yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch"") are the result of a collision between his home planet and the world of intense mint flavor.

Mintberry Crunch has blond, bowl-cut hair. He wears a cyan t-shirt with three pink berries and a green, pointed leaf presumably painted, airbrushed, or stuck on. He also wears gray pants that are presumably painted or airbrushed green on the left side. His left sleeve has several (presumably) fake, green leaves protruding from it. He wears black shoes, however, one of his shoes is covered by a green, leaf-like article of clothing. Half of Mintberry Crunch's face is (presumably) painted to resemble a pink berry. He also has a black stem protruding from the top center of his head. In place of paint, he may be wearing part of a mask to cover his face, however, its lack of movement when he moves hints that it may be painted on, although this could be attributed to ''[[South Park]]'s'' simple style of animation. 
Mintberry Crunch was cowardly before realizing he had actual superpowers, even peeing his pants when [[Mysterion]] tried to convince [[Coon and Friends]] that he had actual superpowers. After he learned he had actual superpowers, he became extremely heroic as well as brave, even confronting [[Cthulhu]] without hesitation.

[[Bradley Biggle]] transforms into Mintberry Crunch by spinning in place and saying ""''Shablagoo!!''"" His power is stated to be the ""the power of mint and berries, yet with a satisfying, tasty crunch!"" Being one of only two members of Coon and Friends to have actual superpowers, his power manifests as the power of flight, super strength and the ability to wield mint and berries as weapons. He is also shown to be able to create large pink bubbles which can protect the objects inside.

Mintberry Crunch is only available in the [[Bring the Crunch]] DLC.

Miss Claridge,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Miss_Claridge,,"was a former pre-school teacher at [[South Park Elementary]], and was first seen in the [[Season Eight]] episode, ""[[Pre-School]]"".

Miss Claridge was severely disabled and covered in burns after a fire broke out in the pre-school classroom at South Park Elementary. The fire was started when [[The Boys|the boys]] wanted to play ""fireman"" and asked the ""baddest kid in pre-school"", [[Trent Boyett]], to start a fire for them. In spite of the boys' efforts to extinguish the fire (by urinating on it), the fire grew out of control and nearly killed Miss Claridge. Miss Claridge survived but was badly injured and placed on a modern chair which very much resembles that of Capt. Christopher Pike in the original ''Star Trek'' episode ""The Menagerie"". She cannot speak, and can only communicate by activating the lights and beeps in her wheelchair. If it lights and beeps once it means ""yes"" and twice means ""no."" It is not clear how she can function as a teacher if she can only communicate ""yes"" and ""no.""

The boys denied all culpability for the fire, resulting in Trent Boyett being sent to Juvenile Hall for five years. One day, Miss Claridge's wheelchair ran out of power in the middle of the road where the boys found her. Seeking to escape Trent Boyett who has been released from Juvenile Hall, they appeal to Stan's older sister [[Shelly Marsh]] for protection. Shelly agrees, but only if the boys confess to Miss Claridge their role in the fire. As the boys start to confess to her, Trent Boyett arrives and confronts the boys. Cartman tries to stop him with his mother's taser gun but it accidentally shoots Miss Claridge. It overcharges her wheelchair which spins out of control and crashes into a propane shop which blows up and sets her on fire. After crashing into a pet shop and getting attacked by cats, she hits a fire hydrant putting the flames out. The police arrive and ask if Trent started the fire. She replies ""no"" with two beeps but the police mistake it for ""yes yes"" and arrest Trent. Miss Claridge appears briefly in two other episodes, ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", where Cartman, in his efforts to atone for his life's misdeeds, gives her a fruit basket and ""[[Erection Day]]"" where she could be seen watching Jimmy perform his stand-up comedy.

A new preschool teacher is seen in ""[[Member Berries]]"", suggesting she is no longer with the school.

She had long, light brown hair with a purple headband. She wore a pink shirt with a white shirt beneath, a purple dress with a flower on the left side, and a purple belt on the waist. She also wore gold earrings (similar to [[Mrs. Testaburger]]'s). After the fire, she is in her electric wheelchair which resembles Capt. Christopher Pike's wheelchair from the original ''Star Trek'' episode ""The Menagerie"".

Miss Havisham,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Miss_Havisham,,"was a character based on the character of the same name from the Charles Dickens novel, ''Great Expectations''.

In ""[[Pip]]"", [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]] is hired by Miss Havisham to be a playmate with [[Estella]]. Later in the episode, Miss Havisham explains why she has her daughter Estella break hearts. Miss Havisham will use the tears from the men with broken hearts to power her Genesis Device, allowing herself to become young again and put herself in Estella's body, and then she will continue breaking men's hearts for another generation. She then uses her robot monkeys to attack Pip. After Pip manages to convince Estella to unhook herself from Miss Havisham's machine, Miss Havisham dies in a fire resulting from the machine malfunctioning.

Miss Havisham is an elderly person, with facial wrinkles and gray hair. She has slender arms and skeleton-like fingers, although her body seems huge. She looks pale and weak, probably because she has not seen the sun (going outdoors) for over 20 years.

She wears a headband made of white, yellow-center flowers, a long-sleeved, dull yellow-rimmed, light blue dress, and a light blue veil. 
She is greedy and selfish, having no qualms about breaking men's hearts for personal gain. It should also be noted, that, while not killing [[Estella]], she would have taken over her body, erasing Estella's consciousness. This further proves her selfishness and lack of empathy. Miss Havisham may be a genius, as she may have built the robot monkeys, though she could have easily bought them, considering her wealth. She also has the Genesis device, which she either built or bought.

Miss Havisham could be some type of superhuman, as she is able spit acid. This acid appears to be very strong, even melting the [[Escaped Convict]]'s face.

She cons the citizens of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] into giving outrageous sums of money for her herbal ""cures"", that supposedly cure diseases and other health problems, often hypocritically stating moments before a sale about the supposed greed of doctors.

Miss Information specializes in ""Native American"" remedies, which she insists that, through their spiritual connection to the world, the will cure one's illnesses faster than Western medicines. Among her products are Cherokee Hair Tampons and All Natural Ball Juice. She states that when one gets sick, their toxins are poisoning them, and must be expelled by means of these remedies. She even hired two [[Cheech and Chong|Mexican men]], to play Native Americans, in order to make her products more convincing.

Miss Information was asked to treat [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] by [[Sheila Broflovski]] and [[Sharon Marsh]] when his kidneys worsened presumably due to his diabetes. Since Sheila was reluctant to get him a kidney transplant, Miss Information applied several fake remedies to Kyle, which either had no effect or worsened his condition. However, she convinced everyone that it was natural for him to look worse before he got better. Eventually, Kyle got so sick that he was on the verge of death. When Sheila brought him in, she said he needed his toxins flushed again, while the ""Native Americans"" noticed how sick he was and insisted he see a doctor. The customers were confused, still thinking that Miss Information's remedies were appropriate. They explained that they were actually Mexicans and that New Age medicines had little health benefits. They were asked to portray Native Americans because Miss Information said no one would buy anything from Mexicans.

The customers finally realized that Miss Information was nothing more than a con artist and proceeded to beat her up. She is likely deceased, as a customer yells ''""Kill Her!!""'' right before the rest attack her.

She wears a red, green, blue, and purple ""tie-dye"" shirt, similarly colored shorts, purple shoes, and a purple-beaded necklace with a presumably bronze medallion hanging off of it. She also wore a black necklace, gold-colored earrings, and a type of necklace-like object seemingly embedded into her forehead.

She seemed extremely greedy, dishonest, selfish and immoral, manipulating people into buying her bogus medicines and conning them out of their money, and even allowing [[Kyle Broflovski|a child]] to approach death, all in order for her own financial gain.

Mitch Conner's ""backstory"" is not revealed until ""[[201]]"". By his own account, Conner is a native of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. When Conner was 18, he joined the Army and fought in the Vietnam War, but preferred to stay in the helicopter rather than participate in combat. It was in Vietnam he first met [[Mr. Hat]], and the two became ""war buddies"". Conner served in the Army until 1972, when his helicopter was shot down outside Saigon, and was honorably discharged due to his injuries. Upon his return to the United States, Conner spent the next several decades as a drifter and con-artist, before ending up in South Park.

Conner first appears in ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", when [[Eric Cartman]] is required to give a report on the effect of Latino culture on the arts in America, he says that he has a special guest: [[Jennifer Lopez]]. However, the real Jennifer Lopez does not show up; Cartman merely does a ventriloquist act with his hand acting as the head of ""Ms. Lopez"". The racism of Cartman's report is quite obvious and upfront. His ""Ms. Lopez"" hand puppet has a heavily caricatured Mexican accent and constantly talks about eating tacos and burritos, despite the fact that Jennifer Lopez is Puerto Rican. ""Ms. Lopez"" is also completely incapable of pronouncing the ""J"" in her name (which Cartman tries to correct unsuccessfully). Despite this, the board of Hispanics gives him first place for having the best report, and he wins a $20 gift certificate at the mall.

While at the mall, Cartman's hand demands to make a music video at a music store, which soon gets the attention of Hollywood Record executives. They proceed to hire ""Hennifer"" because she is supposedly younger and more attractive than the real Jennifer Lopez, who is furious at being replaced. When the Hand-Lopez then steals her then-boyfriend [[Ben Affleck]], the real Lopez goes insane and attempts to murder both the hand and Cartman.

[[File:FatButtandPancakeHead06.jpg|thumb|left|Mitch Conner as Jennifer Lopez.]]
Caught between the psychotic Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck, the record executives, and the police, ""Hennifer"" reveals herself to be a male con-artist named Mitch Conner. Mitch confesses to playing everyone for chumps, before ""killing himself"" by taking a cyanide pill. (In truth, Cartman just opened his hand). Cartman explains that the whole thing with his hand taking on a personality was real, stating ""Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?"" When the others concede that ''maybe'' it could be possible, Cartman reveals it all to be an elaborate prank he did to screw with [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]].

However, ""Mitch/Hennifer Lopez"" returns in ""[[200]]"". When the celebrities that South Park has wronged over the years plan to take revenge against South Park by filing a class-action lawsuit, Cartman appears amongst them with his hand again dressed up as Jennifer Lopez. Despite having Cartman with ""her"" the other celebrities immediately welcome her into the group and reveal their plans.

Apparently their plan was to join in on the lawsuit to get money, but Cartman's hand instead wants to help the celebrities steal [[Muhammad|Muhammad's]] power of not being ridiculed and sell on the black market. When Cartman refuses to go along with it, Mitch tempts him with the truth of who [[Jack Tenorman|Cartman's REAL father]] is. Cartman initially does not believe Mitch, stating that his mother [[Liane Cartman]] is his father. Mitch explains that the story fed to him was a lie and that the tests were faked. They then go to [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] so as to meet with [[Mr. Hat]], Garrison's old puppet teaching assistant who was disregarded shortly after Mr. Garrison came out as gay. Claiming to be old war buddies, Mitch and Cartman force Garrison and Mr. Hat to admit that the tests were tampered with, and prepare to reveal the truth.

At the end of ""[[201]]"", Cartman's father is revealed to also be the father of Cartman's arch-foe [[Scott Tenorman]] and a member of the [[Denver Broncos]], [[Jack Tenorman]]. As everyone is recovering from the events of the two-parter, Mitch says goodbye to Cartman, explaining that there is a bounty on him and that he cannot stay in one place for long. Before leaving, however, he consoles Cartman who is horrified, not by the fact that he caused the death of his own father during the events of ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", but instead by the fact that his own father is a [[Ginger Separatist Movement|ginger]]. Mitch however reminds Cartman that although he might be part ginger, he was also part Bronco, which cheers up Cartman considerably. Cartman opens his hand once again and Mitch disappears, leaving many to wonder when he will be ever be seen again.

Mitch is Cartman's left hand with eyes drawn on it; two eyes and a light pink upper lip on their index finger and a darker pink lower lip on their thumb. When the hand is balled into a fist, the facial features form a coherent appearance, with the thumb being moved to mimic speech. As Hennifer Lopez, Mitch wore a brown wig and pink lipstick. He also can disguise as everyone.

While Mitch seems to act mostly in self-interest, he does seem to be empathetic, comforting Cartman at the end of ""[[201]]"". Whether Mitch is himself or Jennifer Lopez, he is a real chatterbox.

During ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", Cartman initially seems intent on just doing a comedic and insulting bit by doing a ventriloquist bit with his hand. However, as the episode progress, Cartman begins to behave as if his hand is really a living being, arguing with it, and even doing things that he would normally never do, such as jerking off Ben Affleck on multiple occasions or allowing himself to be physically assaulted by Jennifer Lopez; at one point during the episode, the doctor examining Cartman's broken hand tells Liane that his injury is the least of his problems and that he ""appears to be completely insane."" This appears to be a psychotic break on Cartman's part, though he deems it as being something more than that when confronted by his friends. At the end of the episode, he states it to be somewhat of a prank, saying ""I got you kinda, I got you kinda."" Implying either he made up Mitch Conner and then Mitch developed a conscience, or Mitch Conner came to him and told Cartman who he was and dressed as Jennifer Lopez to win the $20 dollars for Cartman, and secretly screw with Ben Affleck and the real Jennifer Lopez. Cartman saying he kinda got Kyle, Stan, and Kenny means that Mitch might have told Cartman what he was doing but did not tell Cartman who he really was or what he was secretly up to, when Kyle had asked Cartman ""Who is Mitch Conner.""

However, in ""[[200]]"", Cartman begins doing the Mitch Conner/Hennifer Lopez bit again. However unlike last time, he seems more driven by money, and his friends have absolutely nothing to do with his plan or even interact with him and Mitch. Cartman again proceeds to have arguments with the hand (even alone in a room where nobody could hear them), and it seems that the hand has knowledge of things that Cartman does not, such as the truth about his father. The fact that Cartman's hand is acting more independently and has knowledge Cartman lacks, suggests that either Cartman has gone completely insane, or like [[Mr. Hat]], Mitch Conner may in fact be somewhat sentient.

During either battle with him, he will have most of the abilities of whoever he is on the hand of (Cartman or Kyle), albeit some of them are modified slightly. For example, Cartman's Coon Claws ability is simply a punch when performed by Mitch. The real danger comes from his ability to randomly apply status effects, gain shields that reflect damage dealt with him, and generally ignore the rules of the game altogether. The New Kid and the others will have to defeat him while working around his constant cheating.

According to The Coon, Mitch Conner escaped prison following the failure of his original plan to impersonate Jennifer Lopez but was presumed dead in an oil rig explosion. He later resurfaced with tintent to run for Mayor of South Park, convincing The Coon to help him on the grounds of the increased crime and anarchy giving him ample enemies for his superhero franchise.

Mitch Conner's plan was to cause a massive upsurge in crime in South Park by lacing the town's alcohol and drugs with ""cheese"", an addictive hallucinatory drug made from cat urine. The resulting anarchy would cause [[Mayor McDaniels|the current Mayor]] to lose favor with the public, allowing Mitch to make his own move for the seat. Once elected, he could then bend the law in his favor and make every day Christmas, seemingly because Christmas was the day with more crime in the year, as Toolshed stated.

To achieve his nefarious goals, Mitch Conner united all of South Park's criminal elements, including Russian, Chinese, and Italian gangsters. His main operatives were the corrupt cops of the South Park Police Division, who he enticed into working for him by promising to let them continue their clandestine activities. He also managed to gain the allegiance of [[Crab People]], who he sent to take over D-Mobile in an effort to stop [[Call Girl]] from tracking his activities, the Sixth Graders, and a group of Meth Heads. He even managed to fund the likes of [[Professor Chaos]] (enabling the would-be supervillain to prepare a truly massive plan to turn the entire town into lava) and Dr. Mephesto (convincing him to turn the resources of his genetics lab to helping Mitch Conner's schemes).

After the [[Freedom Pals]] merged with [[Coon and Friends]], Mitch Conner made his move, ""influencing"" The Coon into destroying [[Doctor Timothy]]'s painstakingly-detailed franchise plan while kidnapping The New Kid's parents. He ordered the New Kid to complete a series of tasks for him, effectively forcing them to promote his electoral campaign by taking selfies with his supporters. Doing so, however, allowed Call Girl to pinpoint his location: the South Park Community Center. Once confronted, Mitch attacked by ""possessing"" The Coon, bending the rules of reality itself to benefit him; nonetheless, he was thwarted by the heroes. He then vanished from The Coon's hand, leaving his host to be apprehended by the Freedom Pals for interrogation.

After interrogating The Coon, the Freedom Pals tracked Mitch Conner's operations to Dr. Mephesto's lab, learning of his plans to become Mayor by raising crime. In response, Mitch unleashed his trump card: a horrifically mutated [[Kyle Schwartz|Human Kite 2]]. In order to defeat the abomination, [[The New Kid]]'s final epic Timefart ended up accelerating time by ten days, more than enough time for Mitch to complete his election race and entrench himself in South Park City Hall. A year later, his plans were in full swing, turning South Park into a dystopian holiday nightmare (especially since he managed to bring in the Woodland Critters as his enforcers).

However, The New Kid managed to fart the Freedom Pals back in time, allowing them to confront The Coon just before he could begin setting Mitch's plans into motion. Seemingly cornered, Conner revealed his final contingency: ""how to make someone fart really hard by hitting them in the solar plexus."" By punching the New Kid to travel even further back in time, Mitch Conner hoped to erase his greatest enemy from time by interrupting their backstory; unfortunately for him, this only gave the New Kid the self-confidence they needed to fart themself and The Coon forward in time, just before Mitch's official election as Mayor.

When The Coon rushed to ""stop"" Mitch's election, he was confronted by the Freedom Pals, with [[Human Kite]] demanding that he reveal Mitch to be nothing but a persona. The Coon denied this, but the situation suddenly became much more complicated; Mitch Conner appeared on ''Human Kite's'' hand instead, claiming that his true plan to stop his enemies was to drive a wedge between them. More perplexingly still, ''another'' Mitch Conner appeared on The Coon's hand, claiming that Human Kite was ""possessed"" by a Mitch from an alternate universe. After much back-and-forth combat, [[Doctor Timothy]] decided that the Freedom Pals needed to defeat ''both'' Mitch Conners, using his own psychic powers to prevent either one from cheating further.

After both Conners were defeated, Human Kite and The Coon each attempted to force the other to confess that they were ""just fucking with [everyone]"", only for The Coon to trick his rival and make a quick getaway. Rushing to the park where the citizenry had gathered for his swearing-in, Mitch Conner tried to get himself elected, but the Freedom Pals caught up and revealed his trickery. With his plans in shambles, Mitch Conner revealed his reasons at last; like the New Kid, someone had fucked his father. To his shock, his mother appeared on The Coon's other hand and told him that she was responsible; enraged and betrayed, Mitch attacked her, ""killing"" them both.

Its initial lineup consisted of [[Eric Cartman]] on vocals, [[Stan Marsh]] on lead guitar, [[Kyle Broflovski]] on bass and [[Kenny McCormick]] on drums. It is unclear who took over vocals after Cartman's departure.
Drawing inspiration from an eclectic mix of musical styles, including hip hop, R&B, fusion and Latin jazz, [[Randy Marsh]] likened their distinctive sound to ""a group of Vietnamese people having their intestines pulled through their mouths.""

Early in the episode, Cartman attempts to persuade the other band members to branch out into the Christian rock genre, which he believed would be more lucrative in spite of the low quality of their material.

Butters then decides to write a [[The Poop That Took a Pee|sequel book]], in which he claims it will be as raunchy as the first.
[[file:The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (61).png|thumb|left|Morgan Freeman reading from ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]]''.]]
When the book is at last released, the [[Today Show]] does a segment in which they have Morgan Freeman read five chapters from the book. Unfortunately, the book is nowhere near as vulgar as the original, instead coming off as childishly written, and resulting in Freeman essentially repeating the words ""poop"" and ""pee"" in assorted manners.

In ""[[Obama Wins!]]"", Freeman appears when information about the current setting needs to be explained. He first appears at [[Red Lobster]] explaining the significance of the ''Star Wars'' franchise to the [[United States]] government. He also explains the relationship between [[General Tso]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Eric Cartman]], and the debacle regarding the missing election ballots.  When asked why he always shows up to explain complicated situations, he responds that every time he explains something, he earns another freckle, to which a new freckle appears on his face.

Morgan Freeman subsequently appears after the election ballots are found. He explains the reasoning behind why the [[China|Chinese]] wish to own ''Star Wars'' and the potential fate ''Star Wars'' would face if owned by Disney. Afterwards, multiple freckles appear one after another on his face.

Morgan Freeman reappears at the end, where he explains the origin of [[Princess Kenny]], and her reason for betraying them and siding with the [[Big Bad Government Guy]]. Kyle asks him why he appears when something convoluted needs explaining, in the exact same manner as Stan did in ""[[Obama Wins!]]"", and Morgan Freeman replies with the exact same answer as he did in that episode.

Moses,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Moses,,"(Hebrew:''' מֹשֶׁה'''‬‎) is a religious prophet who first appeared in ""[[Jewbilee]]"". He is a member of the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]].

[[File:152a.jpg|thumb|left|Moses on [[South Park Studios]].]]
In ""[[Jewbilee]]"", during the meteor shower, the Jew Scouts assembled in the woods and summoned Moses so that they may appease him with offerings of macaroni pictures, popcorn necklaces and soap carvings. When the leader of the Anti-Semitic Jews, [[Garth]], captured him in a conch shell, [[Kenny McCormick]], who had been banished from the camp by Moses for not being Jewish, saved the camp by breaking the conch shell open with his head.

Moses also appears in the episode ""[[Super Best Friends]]"", in which he acts as the computer at the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]]' headquarters, and demonstrates the ability to play a tape by having it inserted through a port in his front. He re-appears as the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]]' computer in ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"".

In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', Moses appears as a summonable character, where he restores the player's party's health.

He is an orange, yellow, and white energy being that has a resemblance to a dreidel. He seems to be ""projected"" by a blue and silver machine. He has two teardrop-shaped nostrils, yellow and orange eyes, and a slit-like mouth.

Moses never seems completely certain about his decisions, often pausing for periods of time to think over a response. This may indicate unintelligence although he may simply be cautious before speaking. However, it is shown that he does have a sense of humor when he chuckled at Seaman saying ""Swallow, come!""

Mothers Against Canada,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mothers_Against_Canada,,"was an anti-Canadian organization formed by [[Sheila Broflovski]] in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Mothers Against Canada is likely a spoof of organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other more offensive Mothers Against-related organizations.

After seeing the [[Terrance and Phillip]] movie ''[[Asses of Fire]]'', and getting into an argument with [[Eric Cartman]] about the plausibility of setting a fart on fire, [[Kenny McCormick]] dies after trying if this was possible. Blaming Terrance and Phillip for the death of Kenny, [[Sheila Broflovski]] started an organization to raise awareness of the ""evils"" of the Canadian people. After a public rally, and [[Blame Canada|a big musical number]], Mothers Against Canada (M.A.C.) was formed. Eventually, M.A.C. gained enough influence to persuade the [[Bill Clinton|President of the United States]] to declare war on the Canadians.

In their protests, they demonized the Canadian people, solely blaming them for the profanity that their kids were using and the obscene acts they had been persuaded into doing. Sheila went so far as to advocate senseless violence against them as long as there was a total lack of foul language. Through all of this, they deliberately ignored the fact that American entertainment was guilty of encouraging acts as foul as swearing, if not more so.

M.A.C. eventually secured the arrest of Terrance and Phillip while they were on the Late Night Show with [[Conan O'Brien]], and was charged with executing them before the U.S. Army in South Park were sent out to destroy Canada. Although the duo were saved from their execution thanks to the show's main characters, Sheila later shot them both dead, thus spawning [[Satan]], his partner and lover [[Saddam Hussein]], and the entire army of hell, as part of a prophecy that called for the culmination of these events. It was this act of violence that nearly led to the destruction of the world and an era of permanent darkness that was only stopped by the show's four main characters.
[[File:M.a.c. logo 1.png|right|thumb|Emblem of ""Mothers Against Canada""]]
Ironically, the very thing M.A.C. tried so hard to abolish was what saved them from Satan's wrath. Cartman's V-chip, which was designed to shock him when he swore, malfunctioned during the chaos and gave him the power to electrocute his enemies, greatly enhanced by his profanity. Cartman easily defeated Saddam through his intense swearing, saving the world.

M.A.C. was disbanded after the first battle of the [[American-Canadian War]], and the defeat of [[Satan]]'s army of darkness.

When Stan goes back to the Woodland Critters he is informed that their ""savior"" is the Anti-Christ, the Son of [[Satan]]. With some nagging from the narrator, Stan goes back to tear down the manger he built for the critters, but is stopped by their Satanic powers. The narrator reminds Stan of the three cubs that are still up on the hill, so Stan heads there for some help. The cubs tell him that they cannot kill them because they are still just babies with baby teeth and little claws. Stan then takes the cubs to learn how to perform an abortion at a [[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic|Clinic]].

When they go back they find out that the Anti-Christ was already born and that the critters are going to use [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] as a vessel. It turns out that this is a story written by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] during [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] class. Kyle does not want Cartman to continue because he thinks it is just another way for Cartman to make fun of him for being Jewish on Christmas. The students egg him on and Kyle finally lets Cartman continue with his story.

Kyle gets possessed by the Anti-Christ; Stan comes up with an idea to salvage the situation. He asks the cubs to perform an abortion on Kyle through his anus. They successfully do so and [[Santa Claus]] (who arrived earlier and killed the Woodland Critters with a shotgun) smashes the Anti-Christ with a mallet. He then goes to the mountain lions' lair and brings their mother back to life. The cubs are happy at the end with their mother being alive once more and Stan goes home for Christmas.

They all share the same appearance. They have childlike faces, blonde fur (which varying in tint among the three cubs), Black and White ears, Brown spots, and tufts of White hair on the top of their heads.
They are very childlike due to their young age. They also do not seem queasy, having no qualms about learning how to perform abortions as well as perform them themselves.

His name, according to the commentary on the episode, comes from a word invented by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] themselves, which they say means ""an obvious joke"" or is said when they do something dumb.

He has facial wrinkles, a large nose, short brown hair, thick, brown eyebrows, and a thick, brown mustache. He wears a black hairnet, a small, white chef hat, and a dark, dull green, long-sleeve shirt. He also wears an orange apron which reads, ""Come an' get it!"".

Mr. Derp is into slapstick humor, which is painful, physical humor.

As a sufferer of Tourette's himself, he has his own verbal tic - randomly saying the words ""piss"" and ""ass"" (particularly spouting things about things going in or out of his ass). He also seems very devoted to teaching others about Tourette's syndrome, even to the point of ignoring any evidence that someone would be faking it, as well as claiming that anyone who thinks otherwise is a ""bully"".

In the end, Mr. Garrison Senior and Mr. Garrison reconciled, with the help of [[Kenny G]], much to the joy of Mrs. Garrison.

He and his wife make a brief cameo appearance in ""[[Oh, Jeez]]"" in a photograph at Herbert Garrison's home.

[[File:Mr_garrison_senior.jpg|thumb|Mr. Garrison Senior in his work clothes.]]
Mr. Garrison Senior is a burly, square-jawed senior citizen who wears blue work overalls with a red-outlined nametag with an orange long-sleeved shirt underneath when working at his gas station.

At home or at his local bar, he wears his orange, long-sleeved top with a dark-green overcoat and dark brown trousers and black shoes. He has age lines on his face, and gray-white hair swept back.

Mr. Garrison Senior is a hard-working man, as he owns and runs his own gas station despite clearly being past the retirement age. Unlike the rest of his family, he has quite a normal moral compass. He becomes shocked in ""[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]"" when his son, and later his wife, became angry with him because he never sexually molested his son as a child.

Confused, but wanting to help his son, he reluctantly asks his drinking buddies for advice at his local bar, but they mistake his question as a ""scruples"" riddle and get distracted asking each other different riddles. Frustrated, he uses his own initiative and arranges for the musician [[Kenny G]] to have sex with Mr. Garrison, pretending to be him.

Mr. Grazier,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Grazier,,"is the scout master that took over Scout Troop 69 after [[Big Gay Al]] was removed from the scouts in the [[Season Five]] episode, ""[[Cripple Fight]]"".

Mr. Grazier is a pedophile, which becomes apparent almost immediately after the parents leave when he demands the children that he take pictures of them naked. He is eventually caught and arrested by the FBI. A Channel 4 news report went out about Mr. Grazier, which prompted [[the boys]]' parents to change their mind about allowing homosexual people into scouts.

Mr. Grazier is visibly in good shape. He has white hair and black eyebrows. He wears a khaki scout master uniform which consists of an khaki shirt and pants, red scarf, and many scout badges.

Mr. Grazier has a militaristic attitude, which he uses to bully the children to do anything, specifically his evil sexual intentions. 

Grazier is a pedophile, meaning he is unnaturally and immorally sexually attracted to children; a severe psychiatric/sexual disorder. He is extremely manipulative and abusive, blackmailing the children into not reporting his sexual abuse and forcing them to perform degrading behavior, showing his incredibly malignant, criminal personality.

Mr. Gueermo,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Gueermo,,"is [[Bridon Gueermo]]'s dancing-theater crazed, abusive, and flamboyant metrosexual father who loves to sing and dance. He first appears as the main antagonist in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"". 

He is part of the men's choir club and usually talks to his family in a sing-song voice. Even in normal conversations, he forces his family to sing with him, otherwise he slaps them.

Every move he makes is overly swishy, his hips constantly swaying and his hands are limp at the wrist, and flamboyant. He always speaks with a stereotypical gay lisp no doubt due to his noticeable overbite. He often spends a great deal of time looking at himself in full-length mirrors, either out of a vanity or to examine his dance moves in order to perfect them. He also slaps people when he gets angry and his slaps are also portrayed as being rather flamboyant and loudly threatening. As he is slapping someone he yells, ""I'll slap you!"". Apparently, he slaps people on a daily basis, when Bridon was about to run away from home, he held up his hand and told him; ''""Go Ahead. Make my day.""''

The obvious victims are, of course, his son and his wife, but also members of Child Protective Services, several members of the school staff, such as the basketball coach and [[Mr. Mackey]], and even his own neighbor. Despite the fact that people get mildly hurt when he slaps them, he turns out to be extremely weak and cowardly, as seen when Bridon punches his father straight in the nose out of frustration. Horrified, and confused, at the greater show of physical violence, Mr. Gueermo cowers away, only to be beaten more by his frustrated [[Mrs. Gueermo|wife]].

Despite the fight, Mr. and Mrs. Gueermo remain together, and Mrs. Gueermo makes her husband come with her to attend their son's first basketball game. He is still bitter about Bridon joining basketball but ended up enjoying the cheering aspects of the game, such as singing and stomping when singing ""[[We Will Rock You]]"".

He also appears briefly in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"" with other various male characters of South Park as they sing an amendment song to the women of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] allowing them to queef, ""[[Queef Free]]"".

Mr. Gueermo wears dark gray pants, black shoes, and a pink collared shirt. He has effeminate wavy brown hair and wears a black necklace with a large orange bead on it. At home, he wears a white tank top and gray underwear.

Mr. Gueermo is an abusive father and husband, who is utterly obsessed with musical theater. He has apparently spent his son's entire life grooming him to be a Broadway performer. He thinks basketball is a ""sissy"" sport, and refuses to let his son play it, even though most of Bridon's peers think he should let him do it. His stage-parenting is so terrible, that he will 'attack' anyone who questions his actions or methods in any way.

Most of the comedy of Mr. Gueermo comes from his very effeminate personality contrasting with his aggressiveness, and his low opinion of sport compared to music theater is completely opposite to a stereotypical father. A stereotypical father would prefer their son to be engaged in sports, rather than musical theater which would be considered overly feminine.

Mr. Hankey,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Hankey,,"is a sentient, jolly piece of feces and the former Christmas deity of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], taking the place of others, such as Frosty or Rudolph. On Christmas, he comes to visit those who has a lot of high fiber in their diets. Prior to being relocated to the town of Springfield from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Mr. Hankey resided in the sewers beneath [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], and therefore has been known to appear as if by magic from out of toilet cisterns, bringing with him tidings of joy, and a ghastly smell. He first appears in the [[Season One]] episode ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"".

</gallery>

Mr. Hankey made his first appearance in ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"" and was seen as generally unknown to the other characters besides [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]], but after the episode's events he was popularized and by ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"" there are several TV specials about him and he even takes a more Santa-esque role at malls, but he makes no actual physical appearance in the episode. In ""[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]"" [[The Boys|the boys]] meet him in the sewer and he explains how the Hollywood people, led by [[Robert Redford]] were destroying the ecosystem. Kyle's and his calls are ignored and turned into a movie starring [[Tom Hanks]] called ""Mr. Hankey and Me"", and Mr. Hankey eventually dies. Using Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls to revive him, he uses magic to get rid of Redford and the Hollywood people, by transforming into a wizard (in the style of [[Mickey Mouse]] from ''Fantasia'') and raises all the feces from the sewers to attack the Hollywood folk with swarms of fecal matter. While this successfully got rid of the Hollywood folk destroying the town, it ironically and very disgustingly covered the whole town in feces.

Mr. Hankey hosts ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"", which features a new rendition of his theme song. He returns for ""[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]"" in which we meet his a wife [[Autumn Hankey|Autumn]], who has a drinking problem. We are also introduced to their three kids: [[Cornwallis Hankey|Cornwallis]], [[Amber Hankey|Amber]], and [[Simon Hankey|Simon]] (who was born with a peanut in his head) Mr. Hankey later sings ""[[Circle of Poo]]"" with Corwallis and helps the boys make their Christmas short. He reappears briefly in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"" with his poo-choo train. This was his final appearance in the series until ""[[201]]"" when he is revealed to have orchestrated [[200|the previous episode's plot]] to hide [[Santa Claus]] in a Bear costume instead of [[Muhammad]].

He is also mentioned in ""[[Pre-School]]"" by [[Trent Boyett]].

He also appeared in ""[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]"", where he was seen rescuing the boys from extreme boredom on the boat they were on. He took them away in his magical ""Helicrapter"". After traveling so far, Hankey took the boys further on his ""Seven Turdy Seven"". From there, Hankey took the boys home on an hour-long ride on the [[Poo-Choo Train|Poo-Choo Express]].

He reappears in ""[[The Problem with a Poo]]"" where he is the director of the Christmas pageant. He starts sending angry, crude tweets after his budget is cut and is later fired. After an unsuccessful hearing and Christmas concert, he is banished from the town of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], and ends up in the town of Springfield from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', where his actions would allegedly be tolerated.

According to ''""[[Goin' Down to South Park|Goin Down To South Park]]""'', Mr. Hankey was inspired by an event that happened to [[Trey Parker]] - as a child, he had the habit of not flushing the toilet; because of this, Trey's dad told him that if he did not flush the toilet, Mr. Hankey would come out and eat him. He and [[Matt Stone]] conceived an adult animated show of what is known today as ''South Park'', where [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] are main protagonists, with Mr. Hankey being a minor character that would be saved for future episodes. They pitched the series to Fox Network executive Brian Graden, who was delighted at the show's premise. Afterwards, the three men discussed with executives from 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Network in order to get the show off the ground. However, the trio later said that the executives passed on the series, after not being fond of the show having to include a talking poo character and thought that the adult animated sitcom should be revolved around a family rather than children in order to be successful.

Mr. Hankey can be seen utilizing several vehicles, usually constructed entirely out of feces and having names with various synonyms for feces.

[[File:Hankey_vehicles_3.png|thumb|Poo-Choo Express]]
The Poo-Choo Express is a locomotive constructed out of feces and is Hankey's most prominent vehicle. It first appeared in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", where it was used to take [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the boys to the North Pole to see [[Santa Claus]]. Although Cartman seemed to be oblivious to the stench of the feces constructed train, Stan and Kyle were disgusted by it. The locomotive appears to be able to lay down its own tracks, also out of feces, which would indicate that it can travel anywhere.

The Poo-Choo Express makes a return in ""[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]"", where it was seen briefly as the last vehicle Hankey used to take the boys home.

[[File:Hankey_vehicles_1.png|thumb|Helicrapter]]
The Magical Helicrapter is a small helicopter made almost entirely out of feces. After Kenny dies of boredom on the boat in ""[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]"", Hankey rescues the remainder of the boys and takes them on a ride in the Helicrapter. Although the Helicrapter is almost all feces, the boys seem unphased by the stench.

[[File:Hankey_vehicles_2.png|thumb]]
The Seven Turdy Seven, also seen in ""[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]"", is a large aircraft also built out of fecal matter. The name is a reference to a similar aircraft by Boeing, which is designated the 737. Its appearance, however, resembles the Boeing 747, a long-range aircraft with four engines and an upper deck. This vehicle was used during the boys' trip home with Mr. Hankey.

Mr. Hankey appears as a piece of poo with three major sections, or lumps. He typically wears a [[Santa Claus|Santa]] hat and white mittens. He has occasionally worn a sailor hat and a wizard hat as well. In earlier episodes, he was a flat shade of brown, but in appearances from the fourth season onwards, he was given more definition with two color tones.

Mr. Hankey is good-natured, cheerful and often full of holiday joy, being a Christmas Deity. He seeks to spread Christmas cheer and goodwill with his presence, and has shown he is very willing to help the boys on many occasions without asking for anything in return. However, when provoked, he has a vengeful and violent side, as shown when he attacked Robert Redford and the Hollywood people in South Park with magical feces.  

He also appears to have poor self-control, as when repeatedly asked to stop taking Ambien to help him sleep, he refuses to do so and begs that he can continue using the medication; he similarly could not prevent himself after taking medication from saying and tweeting out offensive things, which he later brushed off as humor and failed efforts at 'jokes' or spreading cheer.

They can also be seen together when Garrison is ten years younger in flashbacks from ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"". 

Throughout the first five seasons, Mr. Hat is shown to channel Mr. Garrison's repressed feelings and emotions, which when expressed through the puppet, Mr. Garrison often calmly blames on him instead. This includes anger and aggression, such as telling Kyle to ""go to hell"" in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" or threatening the kids Mr. Hat will assault them in ""[[Gnomes]]"". He has also frequently blamed Mr. Hat for racist behavior, such as being a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] protesters in ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"" and using slurs. Most significantly however, Mr. Hat represents his repressed sexuality, with Garrison blaming him for chasing [[Principal Victoria]]'s butt in ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"" as well as various homosexual fantasies.

In ""[[Summer Sucks]]"", Mr. Hat is missing after he and Garrison had an argument before class. Garrison initially blames the students before receiving prank calls from [[Mr. Mackey]] regarding the situation. He visits a psychiatrist for help, Dr. Katz, who summarizes Mr. Hat's nature: 
A common source of humor is Mr. Hat seeming to exhibit behavior suggesting sentience and self-awareness, rather than merely being a puppet and representation Garrison's imagination, often prompting debate about his true nature. Below is a list of moments in the series where Mr. Hat shows sentience:

Mr. Kitty,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Kitty,,"Mr. Kitty seems to suffer from abuse on [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s behavior, usually when she attempts to get some of Cartman's food, to which Cartman always replies by yelling, ""No Mr. Kitty! that's MY (name of food)"" several times, each time his voice becoming more aggressive. This results in either Mr. Kitty hissing angrily at Cartman for being greedy, attempting to scratch him, running away due to his owner's abuse or simply walking away off-screen unable to get sustenance.

[[File:MrKitty3.png|thumb|left|Mr. Kitty after trying to have sex with a severely obese cat in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"".]]
Mr. Kitty would later have a prominent role in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"", in which her gender has shifted back towards female and she is in heat. Mr. Kitty meows loudly wanting to mate, much to Cartman's confusion and annoyance. After attempting to have sex throughout the episode, Mr. Kitty assembles a massive group of male cats to come home with her. She then proceeds to get all the cats high on catnip (which they snort in like cocaine) and all the male cats proceed to take turns having sex with Mr. Kitty. Cartman and his babysitter [[Shelley Marsh]] were, needless to say, horrified. They were able to get rid of most of the cats using catnip and Skylar as an unwilling participant.

Mr. Kitty's next real appearance would be in ""[[Major Boobage]]"", in which Cartman, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] attempt to test whether or not it is possible to get high off of male cat urine (Mr. Kitty is again male in this episode). The test proves to be successful, as Kenny gets high and ends up in a hardcore drug fantasy, that he becomes addicted to. When ""cheesing"", as it is called, becomes a major drug issue in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], the cats of the town are rounded up by the authorities. Showing uncharacteristic concern for his cat, Cartman proceeds to hide him/her in the attic, in which Cartman gives him/her a diary so as to record his/her life, in a manner similar to Anne Frank. Later, Cartman begins to hide more and more cats up in his attic with Mr. Kitty, until Kenny, completely addicted to Cheesing, breaks in and uses them to get completely wasted. After [[Gerald Broflovski]], the key opponent to cheesing, is caught doing cat urine himself, the ban on cats is lifted and Mr. Kitty is free to live with Cartman like before.

Mr. Kitty returns with another big role in ""[[Faith Hilling]]"", where she was caught by Cartman posting pictures of herself on the internet with [[List of Memes#""Cat Breading""|bread around her head]]. After Cartman and [[The Boys|the boys]] finally realized that ""[[List of Memes#""Faith Hilling""|Faith Hilling]]"" was out of style, they used Mr. Kitty to perform various other memes. When they went to do the meme at the [[Colorado Republican Debate (2012)|Colorado Republican Debate]] again, Mr. Kitty was seen being held by Eric when he was to perform the meme. Instead of using the meme that involved Mr. Kitty, Cartman instead ""Faith Hill'd"" the audience, which praised it for being well done. Mr. Kitty has not made any appearances in the show since then.

Mr. Kitty is a gray cat with dark gray ears, and black whiskers. Prior to her appearance in ""[[Major Boobage]]"", Mr. Kitty had a black nose, with the exception of her original appearance in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"" where she had a pink nose. Her updated appearance includes more detailed fur, a more detailed body style, and a tiny pink nose, harkening back to her original appearance.

Mr. Kitty is seen in [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s backyard, in the stables, and inside his house.

With the disappearing of the cats of South Park increasing, Mr. Kitty is only seen sleeping upstairs of Cartman's house. There is an option where the player can pet Mr. Kitty.

Mr. Mackey,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Mackey,,"is the guidance counselor at [[South Park Elementary]], best known for saying ""m'kay"" at the end of most of his sentences. He also serves on the [[City Council]] as head of Public Health. His first name is unknown. 

He first appears in the [[Season One]] episode ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"" and is voiced by [[Trey Parker]].

In ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", Mr. Mackey with assistance from [[Principal Victoria]] and [[Richard Adler|Mr. Adler]] tries to distract the public from a possible school scandal by tying up [[Eric Cartman]] and literally throwing him in front of a bus.
*'''Child sexual abuse (falsely accused)''': He is one of the many adults accused of molesting children in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"". However, the kids only made this accusation to get all the adults in town arrested and have the whole city to themselves.
*'''Giving drugs to minors''': In ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"", he gives a bowl of marijuana to the fourth graders for them to smell. Although, he did it for educational reference.
*'''Threat''': In ""[[Insheeption]]"", Mr. Mackey threatens to rape [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] after the latter interferes with his trash.

""Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?""<br />'''Clyde:''' ""I don't know.""<br />'''Mr. Mackey:''' ""You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay?

Mackey is known to have a talent in singing and has sung the following songs:

[[File:Mmsotcc.jpg.jpg|thumb]]
Mackey wears a green long-sleeved dress shirt, blue tie, dark blue slacks, and blue leather shoes. His hair is black and is thinning. He wears large, black-rimmed glasses. Mackey is well known for his exaggeratedly large balloon head. He has a pointed nose and dimples near the edges of his mouth. It has been implied in ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"" that the size of his head is caused by the tightness of his tie. Yet, in ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", his parents are shown to have the same condition, and in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", his tie is removed before he and [[Ms. Choksondik]] have intercourse, and his head remains the same size.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he wears a green Hawaiian t-shirt, dark blue pants, and a light blue cap. His head is saggier.

Mackey is one of the few relatively sensible and level-headed adults in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He has occasionally taught classes at the school and taught sex education with [[Ms. Choksondik]]. After her death, he took over the fourth-grade class until [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] returned. During a drug-education class, Mackey passes some marijuana around the classroom, and it was stolen (apparently by one of the children, though it is later revealed that the actual thief was Mr. Garrison). For this, Mr. Mackey is fired by the school, and evicted by his [[Mr. Freely|landlord]], and, feeling depressed, he ends up taking drugs himself. He hates it when the children at the school defecate in the urinals and has used at least seven different terms for the word ""crap"", including ""mud monkey"" and ""chocolate corn/hot dog"". He also enjoys messing with pranksters and is a prankster himself as seen in ""[[Summer Sucks]]"". He sides with the ""Rock n' Roll"" side in ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"" but is later seen as a [[John McCain]] supporter in ""[[About Last Night...]]"". He is not very proficient with computers, as seen in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"". In ""[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]"", Mackey suggests to Cartman he should pursue a career writing for the show ''Friends'', implying that he is not a fan of the show.

[[File:InsheeptionPROMO2.jpg|170px|thumb|right|Mr. Mackey portrayed as a child in ""[[Insheeption]]"".]]
It is revealed in ""[[Insheeption]]"", Mackey is a hoarder as a result of intense psychological trauma as a child. Mackey is shown as a timid fourth grader in 1974 who is bullied by a group of children led by [[Billy Thompson]]. It is also revealed that Mackey was a fan of [[Woodsy Owl]], who at the end of the field trip during his fourth-grade year, molested Mackey. His ""give a hoot, don't pollute"" message stuck in Mackey's mind as he repressed the memory, causing his hoarding tendencies.

However, over the time of the series, he developed a very bad temper. In ""[[Insheeption]]"" he angrily states to [[Stan Marsh]] that he will rape him in the mouth if Stan throws anything that he hoarded in his office away.

[[File:IkesWeeWee20.jpg|thumb|Mr. Mackey with his hippie wife]]
In ""[[Ike's Wee Wee]]"", after he became an outcast for supposedly giving drugs to the children, Mr. Mackey met up with a young female drug addict, who invited him to her house to finger-paint. He accepted, and a short while later, at her place, she said ""they should get married and have their honeymoon in India"". He agreed, but then he was rescued by the A-Team who put him into rehab. His wife has never been seen since as she was left in India. A goof is that in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", he states that the last time he had sex was 21 years ago (which accounts for his age as he also mentions he was 19 at the time). However, he clearly had sex with Mrs. Mackey. However, this is clearly backed up by the fact that he was high, so he could not remember it, like in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"".

Mr. Mackey is seen flirting with Liane Cartman in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"" at his meteor shower party. When [[Eric Cartman]] calls his mother to complain about [[Shelley Marsh]], who is watching him, she appears to not hear him and provides no help.

In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", Cartman finds a tape that was recorded between his mother and Mackey, where he was her sex slave and had to drink out of a cup Liane urinated in.

In ""[[Tsst]]"", Mackey had a parent-teacher meeting with Liane, to discuss Cartman's behavior. This led to her bursting into tears, claiming that she is unable to control him. After, Mackey suggests calling one of the nanny reality television shows.

[[File:ProperCondomUse22.gif|thumb|Mr. Mackey and Ms. Choksondik about to have sex.]]
During her introduction in ""[[Fourth Grade]]"", Mr. Mackey finds [[Ms. Choksondik]], like the other teachers, disgusting, especially her sagging breasts. However, in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"" [[Ms. Choksondik]] taught the girls about sex, and Mr. Mackey taught the boys. The two start to talk personally with each other, and this ultimately led to the two of them having intercourse. Indeed, after Ms. Choksondik's corpse was studied in ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", Mr. Mackey's semen was found in her stomach. The news anchor explains that the semen was not what killed her, leaving the audience to presume that Ms. Choksondik took some irony to her name and died choking on Mr. Mackey's penis.

He is very often seen with Principal Victoria, even outside of school, but there has never been any concrete evidence that they are in any sort of relationship, other than business, especially since the Principal's husband appeared in ""[[About Last Night...]]"". They do seem to have a friendly, casual relationship, though. In fact, Mackey hangs around Principal Victoria enough to look like not only the counselor but more a vice principal, although in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", it was revealed that he got Principal Victoria fired due to being used and not being listened to for 18 years.

In ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"", at his party, Mr. Mackey shows his guests his backyard hot tub and says he gets a lot of action because of it, jokingly. It was revealed in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"" that he had not had sex in 21 years (besides with his ""wife"", when he was drugged).

Mr. Mackey first appears in [[Detention Sentence]] watching over kids under detention and having hallway monitors stationed around the [[South Park Elementary|school]] to catch intruders. Mr. Mackey took particular attention on [[Craig Tucker|Craig]], who had previously escaped from detention. Meanwhile, [[The New Kid]] is on a quest to rescue Craig out of detention, defeating the hallway monitors which caught the attention from Mr. Mackey. Through the PA system, he inadvertently reveals the method to gain access to the keys required to unlock the detention hall.

He would later appear in the [[Park County Community Center]] taking part in the PTA meeting. Following the meeting, as [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] is teaching the New Kid a new fart power, Randy instructs them to use their newly learnt skill on Mr. Mackey who was using the toilet.

Mr. Mackey would remain in the community center to manage a small shop. He is also the quest giver for [[Wasted Cache]], where he request the New Kid's help to drop off a monitor at his storage room in [[U-STOR-IT]], while denying that he has a hoarding problem.

Mr. Mackey invites the New Kid for two counselling sessions in [[The Talk]] and [[The Talk 2: The Gendering]] regarding their gender issues. After the New Kid has selected their own sex/gender, Mr. Mackey will call the New Kid's parents regarding their choices.

After [[Mitch Conner]] had been sworn in as mayor of South Park, the New Kid attempted to travel back in time in order to stop the inauguration, only to be brought further into the future. While in the future timeline, the New Kid along with [[Toolshed]], [[Human Kite]] and [[Mysterion]] encountered Mr. Mackey high on alcohol, who was later beheaded by the [[Woodland Critters]].

In [[Therapy Wars]], he held a counselling session for [[Super Craig]] and [[Wonder Tweek]] on their estranged relationship, bringing out the [[Therapy Kids]] to fight the superheroes.

Mr. Mackey has thus far had a speaking role in multiple episodes in every season, as well as ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', and ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

In ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", Mr. Mackey's parents are at [[South Park Elementary]] to prevent him from being abducted. Although Mr. Mackey Senior's name was not acknowledged, he refers to Mackey as ""Junior"", thus giving the idea that the two share a common first name.

He does not appear ""[[Insheeption]]"", despite the episode being set in Mackey's childhood. It is later revealed in ""[[Royal Pudding]]"" that Mr. Mackey Senior was taken and presumably killed by [[Tooth Decay]] two years prior.

Mr. Mackey Senior wears blue shoes, gray pants, and a red turtleneck shirt. He also wears a teal, button-up sweater and small-framed eyeglasses. Mackey is mostly bald, but has gray hair on the sides of his head. He has a large head, alike Mr. Mackey, and has large ears.

Mr. Slave,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Slave,,"is the husband of [[Big Gay Al]]. He is also the ex-boyfriend of [[Herbert Garrison]]. He first appears in the [[Season Five]] episode ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"".

</gallery>

He was the homosexual lover of [[Herbert Garrison]], and his teaching aid before the latter had [[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina|sex reassignment surgery]]. Mr. Slave's catchphrases are ""Ooh, Jesus Christ!"" or ""Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!"", delivered in a quavering lisp. He is rarely heard saying anything other than these catchphrases.

His first major role was in ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", in which Mr. Garrison, the [[South Park Elementary|elementary school]] teacher of the main characters, learns that he can sue the education board for a lot of money if he is fired for being gay, and does his best to ensure this happens. To this end he hires Mr. Slave as his classroom assistant, or, for short, ""teacher's ass."" The lessons become increasingly sexual, and degenerate in nature, culminating in Mr. Garrison inserting the class gerbil, [[Lemmiwinks]], into Mr. Slave's rectum.

In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"" he and Mr. Garrison get annoyed about the [[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]] cast making straight people metrosexual. He, Mr. Garrison, and [[Kyle Broflovski]] went to New York to kill them. When they try to turn them into [[Crab People]], [[The Boys|the boys]]' mothers come and kill them.

[[File:112a.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. Slave on [[South Park Studios]].]]
Despite Mr. Slave's occupation, he is shown to be wise and knowledgeable, offering characters advice when in certain situations. His most prominent moment was in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", when he gave [[Wendy Testaburger]] advice after she wanted to become a whore after seeing that many of her friends had become part of the new trend. Mr. Slave pushed Wendy to not follow the lifestyle due to his own personal experiences and has claimed to be a whore since the day he was born. As a child he has shown to have faked a fever for his mother to take his temperature through his rear end. In his later life he tried to get other boys involved by pretending to be a voice to shout out to beat up the queer kid where he giggles and says ""Jesus Christ"" after being tackled by all the football boys. He subsequently competed in a 'Whore-Off' with [[Paris Hilton]], culminating in her being forced up Mr. Slave's ass. However, having finished this, Mr. Slave rejected the applause, telling parents that they had to teach their children that people like Paris Hilton were to be despised or they'd never learn it, prompting the girls to apologize to Wendy.

In ""[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]"", Mr. Garrison has a sex change operation and becomes a woman. Mr. Slave is upset that he was not consulted on the operation beforehand, which starts an argument, he commented that Garrison never stopped to think how everybody else around her would feel about the sex change, and, being gay, is no longer attracted to Garrison as a woman. When Garrison (now referred to as Mrs. Garrison) callously suggests that Mr. Slave simply stop being gay so that they can continue their affair, he says ""How can you say that? You're gay too."" When Garrison responds that she is a woman, not gay, Mr. Slave walks out, thus ending their relationship. In the episode ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", Garrison decides that she wants him back, but learns that she is too late, as Mr. Slave had moved on with [[Big Gay Al]] — to whom he is now engaged. Jilted, Ms. Garrison makes an ardent, though ultimately failed, attempt to get gay marriage banned.

Subsequently, Mr. Slave and Al join in marriage. He was seen later making cameos in ""[[The Ring]]"" masturbating in the audience at the [[Jonas Brothers]] concert and singing ""[[Queef Free]]"" along with the other guys in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"". In ""[[The F Word]]"", Mr. Slave and Big Gay Al are the first to see the boys' attempts at getting rid of the local [[Harley Riders]], by writing ""Fags Get Out!"" Initially they are both pained and horrified by the sign, until realizing that the boys did not mean anything disparaging against gays, but were instead using the term ""Fag"" in regards to the Harley Riders, stating ""You can be gay, and not a fag"". Al and Mr. Slave both helped to change the definition of ""faggot"" from a gay person, to an annoying Harley Rider.

In ""[[201]]"", after Country Kitchen Buffet was destroyed, Mr. Slave is seen saying his catchphrase when he spotted [[Jesus]] and the other members of the Super Best Friends.

Mr. Slave returns in ""[[Not Funny]]"". The townsfolk are convinced that bombing [[Denmark]] is the preventative solution for their internet histories being made public. The town convinces Mr. Slave to call President [[Herbert Garrison|Garrison]] and convince him to do so. The two had not spoken since the events of ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"" and Garrison was eager to speak with Mr. Slave. Dismissing Garrison's subtle advances, Mr. Slave intentionally provokes him into attacking Denmark.

Mr. Slave looks rather similar to [[Wikipedia: Glenn Hughes (Village People)|Glenn Hughes]], sharing the handlebar mustache, black leather clothing, and the instantly recognizable cap that he wore as a teacher.
Mr. Slave makes an appearance in his house, where his package was mixed up with [[Liane Cartman|Ms. Cartman]]'s, and [[Douchebag]] has to fetch his package from the post office while he gives the package to Liane.

After getting his package, he becomes a Summon in which he forces enemies up his ass, and after that, chases after the remaining fleeing enemies.

Near the end of the game, it is revealed that the FBI or some other organization stuck a snuke up his ass, and the New Kid must go on a journey inside his ass, where he must battle Nazi Bacteria, Armed Guards and the angry [[Sparrow Prince]]. A number of things are found up his ass, including bats, skeletons, multiple dildos, a vibrating cell phone, a pool ball and even [[Mr. Hat]].

Ms. Stevenson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Ms._Stevenson,,"was a [[Kindergartners|Kindergarten]] teacher at [[South Park Elementary]], taking the role following [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s promotion to fourth grader teacher. She appeared in the [[Season Ten]] episode ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"".

In ""[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]"", she has a sexual relationship with [[Ike Broflovski]]. As he is underage, the relationship cannot be considered consensual by legal (or moral) standards.

Ms. Stevenson served as the Kindergarten teacher for some time, during which one of her students, [[Ike Broflovski]], developed a crush on her, passing her love notes and drawing her with hearts around her. When this was brought to her attention by hallway monitor [[Eric Cartman]], she asked him to stay behind after class and tried to discuss why these feelings were inappropriate. She was instead revealed to be a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] when she became sidetracked and instead admitted she admired him and found him ""mysterious"" and acknowledged having feelings for him, leading them to start a romantic relationship, going on many dates together, as well as an intimate relationship involving sexual intercourse, which cannot be  consensual due to the fact Ike is 3-4 years old. She tried to keep her relationship secret from the rest of the town.

Ms. Stevenson's relationship with Ike was exposed by [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who discovered them in the bath together, and she insisted that he was mature enough for a relationship despite his age. They were soon caught and turned in by Cartman when he caught the couple making out in the halls. She falsely claimed to be an alcoholic and attended rehabilitation for her drinking problem as a way to escape jailtime, during which she revealed to a counselor that her uncle would make her and her twin sister kiss and would take photographs.

She then kidnapped Ike and the two prepare to flee to Milan, claiming that she and Ike dreamed of buying a house in Tuscany. They were pursued by Cartman and Kyle, who brought along Cartman's hallway monitor crew, storming the hotel to stop the couple from fleeing the country, and tracking them to the roof of the airport Hilton. They were cornered by the boys and the police, who demanded that she surrender. Not wanting anyone interfering with their love life, Ms. Stevenson said she and Ike would jump off of the building so that she could be with Ike for eternity. However, Kyle convinced Ike that he was too young for a relationship at his age. Ms. Stevenson did not listen to reason and jumped, but Ike did not. Ms. Stevenson realized Ike had abandoned her shortly before she died on impact to the ground. 

She was replaced by a [[Substitute Teacher|substitute]] as seen in ""[[Fatbeard]]"", before a new kindergarten teacher was first seen in ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"". Neither character has been named.

An identical character appeared in ""[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]"" as a shopper outside the [[South Park Mall]]. This could be considered her twin sister, although it is likely just an Easter egg.

Ms. Stevenson wore a dark gray sweater with a pink shirt underneath. She wore a blue knee-length skirt and black high heeled shoes. She had long blond hair in a ponytail, and was considered by most of the men in town to be attractive. 

She was an extremely manipulative and predatory pedophile, manipulating a very underage and juvenile Ike into having a relationship with her, despite the extreme immorality and illegality of said relationship. She also used lies and manipulation to escape punishment. She even resorting to kidnapping Ike and having him enter a suicide pact to fulfill her deranged desires.

Murphy was described as ""crazy because someone killed his pa"", and was kept locked up in [[Sheriff McLawdog]]'s jail.

When a gang of robbers took over Pioneer Village, the leader, [[Franz]], killed McLawdog and [[Vosky]] and [[Domino]] found Murphy in the jail and put him with the other hostages. Murphy stayed in character throughout the entire ordeal, like most of the other Pioneer Village employees. He acted antagonistic towards everyone, especially [[Pioneer Paul]]. When Franz sent his gang to investigate gunfire (Vosky shooting at [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Butters Stotch]]) leaving himself to guard the hostages, [[Stan Marsh]], ""in character"" himself, told Murphy that Franz had killed his pa. With an in-character reason to attack Franz, Murphy lashes out and gives the police an opportunity to move in.

During the ensuing shootout, Murphy abandoned attacking Franz in favor of fist fighting with Pioneer Paul, even long after the police had killed most of the robbers and arrested Franz. He finally stopped when quitting time came, and broke character finally, removing his bald cap.

Murderin' Murphy is played by an unnamed actor with black hair. His costume consists of a poorly-placed baldcap that does not conceal all his natural hair or match his skin tone, fake red facial hair, a long-sleeved rawhide jacket with fur, a satchel, and a necklace with a rodent skull on it.

Mysterion,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mysterion,,"is the super hero identity of [[Kenny McCormick]] who appears in the episodes ""[[The Coon]]"", ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", and ""[[Franchise Prequel]]"". He is one of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s fourth grade students at [[South Park Elementary]] masquerading as a vigilante under the pseudonym 'Mysterion'. He unveiled himself after [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]] persuaded them to for the good of [[South Park (Location)|the town]]. Due to the way the characters' facial characteristics are—their eyes, lack of noses, and mouth—it was initially unclear who Mysterion was to the audience, but the townspeople recognized him immediately.

Originally, [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] intended for Mysterion to be a one-time character and had not planned for his identity to ever be revealed, or even intended for him to be a particular character and intended him, like [[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut|Eric Cartman's father]], only to cause debates among fans. However, during [[Season Fourteen]], Mysterion returned in a story arc beginning with ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"" as a member of [[Coon and Friends]], and in the follow-up ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" his identity was revealed to be [[Kenny McCormick]], and he possesses a superpower - his familiar inability to die.

[[File:MysterionSuspects.jpg|thumb|right|Professor Chaos's wall of Mysterion suspects.]]
Mysterion was first introduced in ""[[The Coon]]"", when he appeared near Cartman (as the Coon) on the roof of Walgreens. Cartman tried to find out his identity (a process largely relying on Mysterion ""tripping up"" over his own speech), but he fails. Mysterion leaves and reports to the local police station the next night to report various crimes - mostly just public order offenses (however, the police are quite impressed). Upon leaving, he is confronted again by the Coon, who feels that he is being ripped off. Mysterion, rather than enter an argument, uses firecrackers to distract the Coon while he escapes. While Mysterion recruits [[Kyle Broflovski]] to gather intelligence for him, Cartman teams up with Professor Chaos ([[Butters Stotch]]) to take down Mysterion - Chaos lays a trap to reel in Mysterion by threatening to blow up a hospital. The plot is successful, but instead of a clean take down, Mysterion - despite coming close to death at one point - comes out on top in a fist fight with Chaos and General Disarray ([[Dougie]]). Afterwards, though, Cartman convinces him to reveal himself to stop these attacks from happening. Mysterion reluctantly agrees, and reveals himself at a press conference (although it is still unclear to the viewer). A deleted ending shows Kyle in prison for vigilantism, when the real Mysterion turns up and asks why Kyle did that - Mysterion reveals himself to Kyle in private.

In ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", Mysterion is a member of the organization called [[Coon and Friends]], headed by Cartman, which fights crime together. Mysterion seems to be an unofficial leader, since everyone respects him over Cartman, and he tries to convince Cartman that there are bigger things to worry about (such as the Gulf Oil Crisis) than the appearance of a new superhero, [[Captain Hindsight]], who does not actually do anything to stop catastrophes but instead explores what could have been done to prevent them. When Cartman beats up [[Mosquito]] and [[Mint-Berry Crunch]] ([[Clyde Donovan]] and [[Bradley Biggle]]), two fellow heroes, Mysterion and the others vote Cartman out of Coon and Friends, and Mysterion takes unofficial command as the group leaves to help confront the Dark God [[Cthulhu]], released by the irresponsibility of DP (formerly BP) in drilling.

In the continuation, ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", Mysterion has decided to keep the group name Coon and Friends, simply because it annoyed Cartman (who has left to track down Cthulhu and ally up with him), and he found it extremely funny. The group are running a lemon bar stall to raise money to help with the crisis, but on return to their HQ (Cartman's basement) they find that the place has been trashed by Hindsight, who had been trying to find pictures of ""him"" having sex with Courtney Love (actually Butters in makeup). He threatens the group with a gun - Mysterion, after trying and failing to reason with Hindsight, pushes his head against the barrel and tells him to fire. [[Human Kite]] (Kyle) tells him to chill out (revealing him to be Kenny in the process), but Mysterion asks the others to go. Hindsight tells Mysterion his ""perfect 20-20 hindsight"" is a curse - Mysterion manages to push that into insignificance with his own curse: his [[Kenny's Deaths|inability to die]], worsened by the fact that nobody remembers his dying.

[[File:MysterionRisesPromo.jpg|thumb|left|Mysterion in [[Clyde Donovan]]'s room.]]
Later, the group meet in Clyde's room researching the ""cult"" of Cthulhu on the internet, where they stumble across a newspaper article about Kenny's parents being arrested for cult activity, at which point Kenny's surprise causes him to drop his Mysterion voice and express his shock using his [[Mike Judge|true voice]]. He questions his parents as Mysterion, and they reveal where the meetings take place to him - as well as that they only went along for free beer, which Kenny does not find very hard to believe. The group go and spy on the meeting, where a particular passage from their book, the [[Necronomicon]], interests Mysterion. Having seen the [[Goth Kids]] at the meeting (since millennia of suffering and darkness ""sounds pretty Goth""), Mysterion confronts them. They do not take him too seriously, but before he gets anywhere the cult leader turns up and tells them to kill him. Despite the rest of the group trying to intervene, the leader stabs Mysterion - who promptly wakes up in his bed. The others turn up, and [[Toolshed]] ([[Stan Marsh]]) asks Kenny why he ""ran away"". Kenny cannot answer, since they will not take him seriously - instead, he sighs in resignation.

In the conclusion of ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", Mysterion ponders where his power came from, while the others discuss what their ""powers"" are. The others do not take him too seriously when he tries to convince them that he actually cannot die - he begins to lose his temper when Kyle says he thinks it would be cool to not be able to die - it actually ""fucking hurts"". He then begins listing different ways he has died. Eventually, he resorts to shooting himself through the head in front of them, much to their shock. Later, the others are once again discussing their ""powers"" and where they came from, at Mysterion's (serious) suggestion that he should explore where his immortality came from. Cartman then reappears, and seems to be remorseful - but nobody takes him seriously. When he convinces them to come outside, he has Cthulhu banish them to the Sunken [[City of R'Lyeh]] (aside from Mint-Berry Crunch, who fled). Mysterion finds some spikes in a pit and purposely falls on one in order to die and be transported out of R'Lyeh to wake up in his bed at home in South Park, so that he can find a way to rescue everyone else. The improvised teleport works, and he returns to the Goth kids, who are gathered in Goth kid Henrietta's bedroom, for information on the cult. Bradley (who is the younger brother of Henrietta) passes by the bedroom door, sees Mysterion inside, changes into his Mint-Berry Crunch costume, and he chases after Mysterion after he leaves through the window. The two eventually track down Cthulhu after Mysterion reads that it takes an immortal to kill an immortal.

Cartman had been using Cthulhu to kill various people he did not like - synagogues, hippie festivals and the city of San Francisco had all fallen prey to Cthulhu. Mysterion arrives and confronts Cartman, who has misinterpreted the idea of being a hero and thinks that it involves making the world a better place for himself rather than other people. Mysterion eventually demonstrates true heroism and offers his own life to Cthulhu in return for his friends - before this can happen, though, a message arrives from space for ""Gok'Zarah."" At first, Mysterion believes the message is for him, but it turns out that the message is for Mint-Berry Crunch. Mint-Berry Crunch subsequently uses his powers to defeat Cthulhu and rescue the remainder of Coon and Friends. After the group puts Cartman in the holding cell with Butters, Mysterion gives up on trying to convince the others that he cannot die. After saying that he is tired and wants to go to bed, he commits suicide once again to return home. Shortly after, Kenny's mother, [[Carol McCormick]], is seen in her own bed, with a rapidly expanding stomach and in pain, saying that ""it's happening again."" We then see her and Kenny's father, Stuart, wrapping a baby up in Kenny's orange parka and placing the baby in Kenny's bed. Carol then remarks, ""We should've never gone to that stupid cult meeting.""

[[File:ThePoorKid45.png|thumb|right|Mysterion beating up [[Jessica Pinkerton]].]]
In ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", Kenny is shown to have kept his alter ego. While he is not seen fighting crime, he has been protecting [[Karen McCormick]]. After being moved into foster care, Karen becomes distraught and cries in her sleep. Mysterion, or as she refers to him, ""guardian angel"", appears at the window to reassure her that she would be okay. Later, when Karen is being bullied in the school playground, Mysterion arrives, clinically dispatches [[Jessica Pinkerton]], and warns everyone to keep away from Karen. He lights a few fireworks and escapes without further incident. Finally, he distracts the agnostic foster parents by drawing question marks on the bedroom walls, leading them on a merry-chase. He then escaped out of a window, left a note on the window, where he left a can of Blue Ribbon. After consuming the beer, the Weatherheads are arrested and Kenny was reunited with his family and friends at school.

Despite everyone's insistence on how important Mysterion was to the town, he appeared to stop relatively small crimes. The only crimes we saw him stop were public disorderly conduct and graffiti, by reporting them to the police. He also beats up Professor Chaos and General Disarray to stop them from blowing up a hospital and his dialogue with Chaos indicates that he has probably stopped his ""evil"" plots before.

The town's insistence on Mysterion's importance could be an example of their stupidity, as they might believe that Professor Chaos really may be capable of destroying the world.

In ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", he is seen toting a handgun, although he never uses it for his vigilante activities, but only to shoot himself on two separate occasions. The only tool we had seen Mysterion to use was a strand of firecrackers, which is illegal in the state of Colorado, in order to escape from the Coon. Mysterion uses firecrackers to distract the school students at Greeley when He takes Karen away from her tormentor and the crowd around them.

Mysterion uses a Mysterion Logo on a spring, like the one on his head, leaving it on a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer, as a sign that he was there.

Mysterion seems to share similar characteristics with various other superheroes, particularly those from DC Comics' Batman franchise. Matt Stone and Trey Parker state on the commentary for ""[[The Coon]]"" he was intended as a parody of modern ""dark' superhero films, using ''The Dark Knight'' and ''Watchmen'' as examples.

Some of Mysterion's quotes are very similar to those of The Spirit. One such example is the quote, ""The city needs my help. It cries for protection, and I will answer the call to save her"".

Immortal Man and Resurrection Man are similar heroes from DC comics who, like Kenny, are resurrected when they die.

Batman, the alter ego of Bruce Wayne, often uses a low voice to disguise himself. Mysterion did this as well so that none of his classmates, or the people he knew as a regular child, would recognize his voice. The contact that Mysterion had with the police was similar to that of Batman's partnership with the police commissioner of the city of Gotham, James Gordon; both of them report to their respective informants for relaying information about crime. Also, Mysterion's manner of disguise and choice of words allude to Batman's, for they both hide their defining features, especially around the face, and consider themselves symbols of their cities/towns. They both speak only when necessary and tend to spend more time alone, prowling the streets for crime. His reluctance to work with other heroes is also similar.

Rorschach, one of the central characters of the graphic novel and film ''Watchmen'', is mentioned by Stone and Parker in the DVD commentary as a major inspiration, along with Batman, for Mysterion. Like Batman, Rorschach has a deep, throaty voice similar to Mysterion's. Also in one scene, Mysterion speaks directly to the viewer via inner dialogue, and his inner dialogue is similar to Rorschach's journal throughout the film and graphic novel.

[[File:TheRiddler.png|left|thumb|DC Comics' the Riddler.]]
One of Batman's most prominent foes, The Riddler, shares his question mark icon with Mysterion, who wears it atop his cloak. While question marks mean different things in regards to each, they are similar in appearance, with the exception that Mysterion's is bright green and Riddler's are many colors.
A member of the Teen Titans. Both Raven and Mysterion share the following: They are the darkest members of their respective teams. They share an origin that involves demonic entities, Raven being Trigon's daughter and Mysterion being related to the Cult of Cthulhu. To top it off their attire is comprised of a hood and robe like cape of similar color spectrums. Raven's being a dark blue and Mysterion's being a dark purple.

Mysterion looks very much like a child superhero, as he wears a pair of white underwear briefs over his base suit, which is an off-lavender and has a bright green 'M' on the front of it. Around his waist, there is a plain, thin black belt with a dark grey, standard buckle. Brown boots adorn his feet and olive-green gloves adorn his hands. There is a dark purple cloak that drags on the ground wrapped around his neck and provides a shield for his hair or any defining features. This cloak has a bright green question mark made of some type of sturdy material attached to a spring that juts out from the top of Mysterion's head. Finally, he wears a black half-mask that covers his face from the bridge of the nose up.

Unfortunately, there are little clues as to what features Mysterion possesses that makes him distinctive. Like most children in South Park's animation style, Mysterion has a perfectly round head, an averagely sized body, two tilted oval eyes with black pupils, and a mouth. He is extremely agile, and can run away quickly enough to disappear while a string of fireworks are blowing up.

When he shows his face in ""[[The Coon]]"", that is Kyle, not Kenny, as shown in a deleted scene, where Kyle is in jail, and Mysterion walks up to him. The real Mysterion then shows his face. However, deleted scenes are non-canon in most television shows, so this may not hold true.

[[File:MysterionRises58.png|thumb|left|Mysterion confronts the [[Goth Kids]].]]
Mysterion is the embodiment of the anti-hero character archetype. Much of his attitude and view of the world stems from his experiences as Kenny, from his poverty, his willingness to help others in a time of need, as well as his inability to convince his friends of his inability to stay dead, which he views as a curse. Most of the time he is calm and calculating, making him an excellent strategist. However, there are times when, usually when people fail to take him seriously or in discussions with the Coon, that his temper gets the better of him - he came very close to lashing out violently at Kyle when he said that not being able to die would be ""pretty cool"". On another occasion he said that he finds pissing Cartman off ""extremely funny"" - possibly the only time Mysterion has laughed. He also displays a different persona than his real-life self, coming off as more gruff, intense, authoritative and grounded, whereas Kenny (usually) tends to be more lighthearted, easily amused and annoyed, also tending to play more of a supporting role with his friends.

Despite being the near-exact opposite of the Coon, Kenny has used his alter ego to improve his own life to an extent - he convinced his parents to stop beating each other up and abusing their kids, stop doing drugs (although he has only been semi-successful with both of these demands) and give their children allowances.

Mysterion seems to be more of a hand-to-hand combat fighter, as we see when he fights with Professor Chaos and General Disarray. Mysterion has great agility, as he made it to the top of buildings without the use of ladders, stairs, or elevators. In ""[[The Poor Kid]]"", he effortlessly beats up a school bully while protecting his sister.

[[File:CoonvsCoonandFriends26.png|thumb|right|""Ow! That FUCKING HURTS!!""]]
In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" we are to discover Mysterion possesses a superpower - he is unable to die, always waking up in his bed every day as if nothing ever happened, with nobody remembering his death. He has [[List of Kenny's Deaths|died ""countless"" times]], and is unaware of why himself. It is implied however, it has to do with the [[Necronomicon]] and the cult of Cthulhu. In ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", it was also revealed that he may use his immortality as a sort of improvised teleport: Since he will go back to his bed after he dies, he kills himself to be sent back there. He uses this technique to escape the sunken city of R'lyeh.

Mysterion has an unconscious ability to manipulate the memories of others; whenever he dies, witnesses forget the memory quickly. He seems unable to control this power, as he constantly tries to have his friends remember his deaths, but with little success.

Mysterion is able to change from his normal clothes to his hero suit at very short notice - between hearing that Karen McCormick was about to be beaten up and the bully in question advancing, he was able to change clothes, find firecrackers for a later distraction, and have enough time left to get onto the roof of the school.

Mysterion is shown to be able to jump high enough to kick a taller girl in the head in "" The Poor Kid "". He also shows great strength, able to carry Karen McCormick on his shoulders and climb up a gutter without struggling.

Mysterion can jump from great height and not be hurt, or at least not be phased, by the pain that a normal person would feel. He jumps off a building and in front of The Goth Kids in ' Mysterion Rises "", and in "" The Poor Kid "", he jumps out of a second floor window in his foster parents house. It is possible that since Mysterion is always able to come back alive, he has been training himself to perform various dangerous tasks, and killing himself in the event he gets a crippling injury.

Mysterion sides with [[Doctor Timothy]], [[Toolshed]], [[Tupperware]], and [[Wonder Tweek]].''For more quotes, see [[Mysterion/Quotes|this page.]]''

[[File:Nathan Captain.jpg|thumb|left|Nathan in ""Crippled Summer"".]]
Nathan sold steroid medication illegally to [[Jimmy Valmer]] during the events of ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", when Jimmy tries to find ways to win the Special Olympics. This led to Jimmy physically abusing [[Nancy]] and [[Sarah Valmer|his mother]] in a fit of roid rage, but with winning all of the events in the Special Persons Olympics. Afterward, Jimmy felt guilty for cheating and confessed to the Olympic committees, resulting in his forfeit of the medals he won.

Nathan's second appearance was in ""[[Crippled Summer]]"" at the summer camp named [[Lake Tardicaca]], a summer camp for the disabled. Every summer, the camp splits into two teams, who compete for the camp championship in a series of games. While Jimmy is the beloved leader of the camp's Blue team, Nathan is the sinister leader of the Red team, which is why they had lost to the Blue team three years running. Furious for losing to Jimmy so often, he creates assorted plots aimed at not only ruining the Blue team's chance at victory but also will result in the death of Jimmy, who Nathan confesses to loathe. However, Nathan's lackey, [[Mimsy]], continuously botches up Nathan's plans, which causes Nathan to suffer a bite from a Black Mamba snake, be painfully attacked by Native Americans, comically raped by the [[Tardicaca Shark|shark]] inland and finally blown himself up. While being rushed to the hospital, Jimmy, who is crowned king of summer camp, and who is unaware of Nathan's loathing, gives Nathan his crown as a sign of goodwill. Nathan, however, confesses to hating Jimmy and threatens Mimsy for his stupidity.

His third major appearance was in ""[[Handicar]]"", where he again plays the main antagonist, along with Mimsy as his sidekick. When he hears about making a fundraiser to go to summer camp, Nathan is already over with going to camp with Jimmy being successful again. He attempts to sabotage the fundraising efforts of [[Timmy]]'s new transportation business, which is earning a lot of money towards the class goal of returning to Lake Tardicaca summer camp, by hiring cab drivers to ""break"" Timmy's legs, sexually harass a woman while being hired to the business, and making a race to take the prize money by winning. After the race, Nathan tries to convince his mom that he does not want to return to camp, but she pretends to not understand him.

He appears again in the [[Season Nineteen]] trilogy. [[PC Principal]] makes him the editor of the [[Super School News#Super School Newspaper|Super School Newspaper]]. Nathan is later revealed to be working for [[Leslie Meyers]]. In [[PC Principal Final Justice]], Nathan holds Jimmy hostage and reveals he has been getting the PC people to work with ads. He has a new girlfriend, known as [[Classi]]. Nathan then plans for a tragedy in [[The South Park Gun Show]], but Classi objects. He hits her and is consequently beaten up by her while Jimmy escaped.

Nathan appears again in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode ""[[Moss Piglets]]"", where he gets jealous of Jimmy and Timmy's project as he realizes it will win the science fair. He and Mimsy try to sabotage their project in an attempt to steal the win from them. He puts a hair curler in the [[Water Bears]] sample, electrifying them, which unwittingly makes them smarter.

Nathan plans out the attacks and is the boss over Mimsy; he is also the team captain for the red camp. However, Mimsy and his allies sometimes do not understand his moves and which end up backfiring at Nathan.

Nathan can play the notes on the bomb-rigged ukulele correctly, which heedlessly exploded on him instead of Jimmy.

Nathan is a capable drug dealer, being able to handle money and sell drugs to the other students. He is also seen selling accounts for different streaming services in ""[[Basic Cable]]"".

He has committed and shown examples of various criminal activities throughout the series.
The most notable appearance of Nathan is that his head is always looking up at an angle, usually to one side, which gives him a snobbish and elitist appearance and vibe. Nathan has squinty eyes, long dark blond hair, and wears tinted glasses (it’s unknown if these are sunglasses or prescription lenses). On most occasions, he wears a dark gray buttonless jacket with red trim and an orange shirt underneath, gray baggy pants, and green sneakers with white stripes.

In ""[[Handicar]]"", when he goes to sleep, he wears a light blue onesie with blue trimmings and yellow stars. He talks in a low, raspy voice with a slight speech impediment, i.e. pronouncing “shark” as “shorwk”.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Nathan appears as an adult man. He is seen with a teal tracksuit, and a gold necklace, similar to Mimsy. He also has long hair in a ponytail, stubble on his large chin, and seemingly white pearls on his glasses.
Nathan has Down syndrome. He also likely has some form of sociopathy, as evidenced by his plots in ""[[Crippled Summer]]"". While all his plots fail in a fairly cartoonish manner, the intention behind them (i.e. getting Jimmy and his friends stabbed, murdered, poisoned, raped, or bled to death) hints at poor mental health. His anger could also be due to his parents not taking him seriously. He often pretends to be more disabled than he really is to conceal his real plans, such as in ""[[Sponsored Content]]"", when he responds to [[PC Principal]] by saying ""I like apples and bananas"".

However, in ""[[South Park: Post Covid]]"" he attends Kenny's wake set up by Jimmy, and laughs at his ""woke"" jokes. This implies that either his hatred of Jimmy has gone away or has greatly diminished. 

Each problem that hits Nathan in the episode ""[[Crippled Summer]]"" would be fatal in real life: A bite from the venomous Black Mamba causes death fairly quickly; arrows at high velocity to the center of mass often cause death by exsanguination; the weight of a full-grown shark on top of a human is fatal; a close-range explosion of C4 leads to instant death. Nathan's inexplicable survival throughout the episode follows a common ''Looney Tunes'' theme, where characters survive normally fatal catastrophic events.

The relationship between Nathan and his parents is terrible overall since they baby him and it is possibly the main reason behind Nathan's morbid mind.

Nathan finds it hard to communicate with his parents, so he barely confides in them. For instance, he suffers at the Tardicaca Summer Camp every year, but his parents know nothing about this, until ""[[Handicar]]"". Nathan does not have much respect for them either.

On the other hand, his parents are totally carefree and they pay no attention to him. It is revealed in ""[[Handicar]]"" that they are aware of his dislike of camp and purposely send Nathan to summer camp just to ensure their own trip to Italy.

[[File:Nathan_&_Mimsy.png|thumb|Nathan and Mimsy in ""[[Black Friday]]"".]]
Nathan's only friend is his lackey [[Mimsy]], who does whatever Nathan tells him. He abuses Mimsy verbally and physically for their failures in the various plots against the blue team at the summer camp. Just as Nathan is about to order Mimsy to do another plot to kill Jimmy, a [[Francis (Special Ed)|teammate]] says ""Gee, I wish our team captain was as awesome as Jimmy"", could probably hint that a lot of people do not like him.

[[File:WarComing.jpg|thumb|Nathan and Jimmy.]]
Nathan harbors an utter hatred and jealousy towards Jimmy and has schemed several ploys to get him killed, but they always backfire on him. In his first appearance in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"", he sells steroids to Jimmy to help him compete in the Special Olympics, but has since developed a one-sided rivalry with him. Jimmy has either remained oblivious to Nathan's disgust towards him or simply has not let it bother him.

There seems to be less about his relationship with Timmy, but it might be caused with him being friends with Jimmy. In ""[[Handicar]]"", Nathan tried to sabotage [[Timmy]]'s new Handicar taxi service just to get out of summer camp.

Nathan is always the mastermind, but not with [[Leslie Meyers]]. In [[Season Nineteen]], Nathan is revealed to be the lackey of Leslie, he replaces [[Jimmy]] as the [[Super School News|school newspaper]] writer and puts sponsored content as well as fake news on it. He is ordered by Leslie to hold Jimmy hostage, in his loft at [[CtPaTown]].

Nathan explains that ""I'm just gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it"", which implies that he actually fears Leslie's inhuman powers. He earns a big fortune by working for Leslie though.

Nathan's plan was foiled by the New Kid during [[Bring the Crunch]], and he blames the New Kid for his painful endurance of mind-rape, this results in Nathan's grudge. The hatred enhanced when the New Kid farted on him, but he still hates Jimmy more.

Nathan hired Classi to be his live-in girlfriend using the money he earned from collaborating with Leslie and the Ads. Unlike Mimsy, Classi is far from stupid and warns Nathan the Ads are simply using him for their own gain. He tries slapping her into shutting up, but she hurts him twice as hard and defects to Jimmy's side, helping him escape and preventing the Ads from taking over the world.

Nathan's Parents,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Nathan%27s_Parents,,"appear at the end of the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, ""[[Handicar]]"".

Throughout the whole of ""[[Handicar]]"", Nathan unsuccessfully tries to sabotage [[Handi Car]] just so that he does not have to attend summer camp. He finds it hard to communicate with his parents and so barely confides in them; he gets angry when [[Mimsy]] suggests that he simply tell them not to send him to camp. Having exhausted all other options at the end of the episode, Nathan finally confesses to his mother that he hates summer camp and does not want to go any more. Nathan's mother pretends not to understand what he says. It turns out that she and her husband are bent on sending him to camp just to ensure their trip to [[Italy]].

They are selfish and do not care about the needs of their son, forcing him to go to camp against his will just so that they can go to Italy. Nathan's mother pretends to be loving and ignorant of what her son says, but she is in fact covering up for her and her husband.

Nathan's father has eyebrows and light brown combed hair, a double chin and large ears and wears a dark green short-sleeved shirt, black belt with a gray buckle, white pants and black shoes. The mother has brown hair and eyebrows and wears a white shirt under a blue jacket, black skirt and black shoes.

In ""[[Pinewood Derby]]"", [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s Pinewood Derby car shoots off the track and into space, reaching warp speed. Not long afterward, two NSA agents, Agent Clark and Agent Marx, visit [[Portal:Characters/Families#Kern / Kimble / Marsh Family|the Marshes]] and tell them that an alien species found the car and are on the way to Earth to make contact. 

In ""[[Let Go, Let Gov]]"", [[Eric Cartman]] talks non-stop about the NSA spying on everyone, much to the annoyance of [[Kyle Broflovski]]. [[Butters Stotch]] misunderstands his paranoia, prays to the government, and starts a new religion of confessing one's perceived ""sins"" at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]].

Cartman then goes undercover to expose the NSA's surveillance by disguising himself as [[Bill Clinton]]. The head of the NSA, [[Chief Joe]], is apparently unaware that Cartman is undercover and gives him the job. He shows Cartman how the NSA watches people around the US, with the workers reporting to him about nonchalant things which they see as important. Later on, he and Cartman go to a [[Hippies|hippie]]'s home to talk with him after he threatens to blow up the Lincoln Memorial.

When they get back, Cartman tries to find out information about himself and asks the other workers about the profile of ""Eric Cartman"". It turns out that the NSA deems him as ""fat and unimportant"". Cartman immediately tries to convince them to change the profile, but they refuse. 

Chief Joe later reveals how the NSA is capable of keeping track of everyone in America. They use [[Santa Claus]] who is hooked up to a machine. Cartman then breaks his cover and puts the revelations on the Internet. The next day, however, Cartman is seen crying in his room. He had  expected people to be mad at the government and to think he is cool, but he realizes that no one cares about the truth he uncovered.

Jimbo and Ned met while in the Vietnam War, where Jimbo was a helicopter pilot. During the war, Ned lost his right arm when a hand grenade exploded prematurely in his hand. In earlier episodes he can be seen with a skeletal, gray, prosthetic arm. Ned also lost his formerly mellifluous voice due to a laryngectomy, apparently caused by laryngeal cancer from cigarette smoking, and speaks with an electrolarynx. Despite the fact that Ned lost one of his arms, he can still wield two-handed weapons, such as a flamethrower and even an M249 SAW in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

He is usually seen hunting with Jimbo and is a co-host on ''[[Huntin' and Killin']]''. When Jimbo says ""It's coming right for us"", Ned usually repeats it in his electronic voice.

Ned was more prominent in the first five seasons, much like [[Pip Pirrip]] and [[Chef]], usually featured alongside [[Jimbo Kern]] with the two acting as leaders of the townspeople in times of crisis. Their roles gradually diminished, and by the fifth season, [[Jimbo Kern]] began acting more as one of the regular townspeople with Ned fading into the background. After the sixth season Ned has ceased to have speaking roles, being almost completely absent by season eight outside of crowd scenes. He did appear in ""[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]"" and three seasons later in ""[[The F Word]]"", and during [[Season Fourteen]] he made quite a few cameos, such as in ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"", ""[[200]]"", ""[[201]]"", and ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", but having no lines in any of them. In ""[[Time To Get Cereal]]"", Ned is severely injured.

Ned has not spoken alone since around the fifth season, but he did speak in ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' which were both released during the thirteenth and seventeenth seasons respectively, showing Trey Parker was still capable of performing his voice, though it did sound slightly different.

He finally received his first speaking role in an episode about 17 years later in ""[[Time To Get Cereal]]"", where he was taken away by [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]]. He was considered ""missing"" until the season finale ""[[Bike Parade]]"", where he was seen at the Bike Parade in a wheelchair, covered in full body cast. By the ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", he appears to have recovered from his injuries.

Ned has short, messy gray-brown hair. He has a small mustache and goatee. His right arm is missing due to a grenade accident during the Vietnam War. He wears a camouflage shirt, light blue jeans, sunglasses, and a black headband. Ned is usually straight-faced. He's very skinny and noticeably smaller than the other ''South Park'' adults. He is comparatively less detailed than some of the other adults in the show.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he has graying, balding hair, and wears a brown jacket over a white shirt. He is confined to a wheelchair. He appears to have kept scars from injuries made by [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]].

Ned Gerblanski and his best friend [[Jimbo Kern]] represent South Park's large population of stereotypical ""hicks"". They are obsessed with large trucks, beer, guns, explosions, and killing animals. They detest ""liberals"" and circumvent anti-hunting laws by yelling, ""It's coming right for us!"" before shooting any animal, thereby justifying the kill as self-defense. Later, after a court ruling, they claim to be shooting the animals so as to ""thin out their numbers"", despite the fact that they are shown shooting at endangered species when they shout this phrase. Ned hardly shows any emotion; mostly just staring blankly ahead of him. It was revealed in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", that Ned used to be a State Champion Boxer until a grenade blew his right arm off. Throughout the episodes, many characters (mainly Jimbo) say that Ned is 'accident-prone' due to certain unfortunate things that have happened to him: blowing his arm off, running into a telephone pole, getting trampled by a herd of cows, etc. Though they both are best friends and share the same interests, Ned seems to be the opposite of Jimbo. While Jimbo is tall, fat, and loud, Ned is short, skinny, and quiet. Jimbo is a natural leader while Ned seems very dependent on Jimbo and does everything he says. Ned also seems more easily frightened than Jimbo, particularly in the episode ""[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]"" when he frequently states how terrified he is of the frog, working himself into such a state that he becomes catatonic upon seeing it. Ned also has very varied interests and hobbies: he is a local history buff (""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]""), a former champion boxer (see above), and used to be a good singer, not that that stops him from singing now.

[[File:Ned dressing gown.jpg|thumb|Ned walking around the house he shares with Jimbo in his more relaxed attire. (From ""[[Jakovasaurs]]"".)]]Due to his close relationship with [[Jimbo Kern]] and the speculation about Jimbo's sexuality, there has been much speculation over Ned's sexuality. As with Jimbo, there is evidence for him being gay and straight. In the early seasons, he lived in the same house as Jimbo and was completely comfortable walking around in front of Jimbo wearing small zebra-stripe underpants and a very short dressing gown which is completely open at the front. However, he has had sexual relationships with [[Liane Cartman]], even stating that he ""could be"" [[Eric Cartman]]'s father in ""[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]"". It is revealed in ""[[Summer Sucks]]"" that he used to be married, mentioning his ex-wife. However, he also admitted to watching another man masturbate in ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"".

Jimbo plays a major role in the game ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' alongside Ned Gerblanski, hunting out at [[Stark's Pond]] when it is attacked by [[Jakovasaurs]] and other enemies. He and his partner both function as powered-up 'fiery-works' towers, but without costing the player any money. Neither character is playable, however, and it is unknown if the game is canon.

Ned is found manning South Park's local weapon store alongside Jimbo, where the player can buy high level weapons and start a quest to hunt down several rare wild creatures.

Ned is once again found inside Jimbo's Guns with Jimbo, but is no longer behind the counter and plays no role in the storyline. After retrieving Jimbo's wallet, both characters can be summoned together to eliminate enemies, delivering ""It's comin' right for us!"" and with Ned throwing a live grenade.

Ned has been seen in various cameos throughout the series, usually with Jimbo.

Nellie McElroy,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Nellie_McElroy,,"is [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]]'s mother who lives in Scotland. Her first appearance was in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[The Succubus]]"", where she comes to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] with [[Thomas McElroy|her husband]] for Chef's wedding.

She made a second appearance in the [[Season Six]] episode, ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"". Chef takes [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] to his parents' manor house in Scotland. She performs a shaman-esque ritual to exorcise [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] soul from Cartman's body. Although she is successful in exorcising Kenny's soul she is unable to re-seal it because Chef hadn't brought a victim child to sacrifice. Instead, Kenny finds his way into a pot roast Nelle was preparing, much to her dismay.

Her most recent appearance to date is in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", where she is seen along with Chef in a crowd during the town's Christmas celebration. She is not seen at Chef's funeral in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"".

She appears to be very old, with wrinkles and grey hair. She has a full head of curly grey hair and wears a yellow dress and a pearl necklace. Her eyes seem to be perpetually closed. She also appears to carry a small blue handbag around. In ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"", she appears in full voodoo regalia, with a long white robe, an intricate mask and headdress, fake wings and one scepter in each hand.

She appears to be friendly, being very accommodating to [[Liane Cartman]] and [[Eric Cartman]] when they visit her house in ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"". Nellie appears to be a little senile and over-concerned with household duties, worrying about Kenny's spirit getting all over the curtains and her pot roast, and occasionally muttering things to herself.

She appears to have a good relationship with her son, Chef. He lives in the [[United States|USA]], and she appears to miss him a lot. When he appeared at their doorstep in Scotland she was overjoyed to see him again.

Nellie and Thomas both love each other very much. They argue constantly over their frequent encounters with the Loch Ness monster.

She wears a pink, sleeveless button-up shirt, blue pants, and white shoes. She has wavy, blonde hair and small navy blue earrings.

She is very kind, being very loving to Butters in ""[[AWESOM-O]]"". She is pretty much the only family member who is entirely kind to Butters.

She is married to [[Uncle Stotch]]; they have not been seen fighting, so it is assumed they have a fairly good marriage. 

She is Butters' aunt, it is assumed she loves him very much, judging by her reaction when he first arrived from the airport in ""[[AWESOM-O]]"".

Nelly,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Nelly,,"</gallery>

In ""[[The List]]"", she was attacked by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail]] when he tried to kick her in the groin, which did nothing, due to [[Eric Cartman]]'s ignorance of the female body. Nelly beats up Butters, giving him a black eye. Another attempt was made in [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time]], during which the list was successfully taken from Nelly.

Nelly has brown hair and parts it into two pigtails. She wears a light green sweater with a picture of a daisy on it and wears dark green trousers.

Throughout her appearances, she seems very confident and headstrong. According to [[Bebe Stevens]], Nelly would never let the boys see the list, so it can be assumed she is trustworthy, at least to the other girls. She also seems to be one of their leaders during the Gender War, pitting her directly against the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out]] movement. Judging from Butters's injuries, Nelly is able to fight, and she noticeably does not flinch when he tries to attack her. Her ability to fight and her loyalty to the List-Making Committee may be the reason she is the keeper of the lists.  When Cartman is trying to get the girls to say something funny, she speaks back to him sarcastically.

In ""[[The List]]"", Nelly is a member of the girls list making committee. She is in charge of holding onto and protecting lists from non-members.

In ""[[The List]]"", Butters tries to take the list from Nelly by kicking her in the crotch. This has little to no effect on her as she questions what he's doing and after the other boys abort the plan he is seen with his arm in a sling and a black eye.

In ""[[Member Berries]]"" when she called Cartman a ""fat fuck"", Butters laughed really hard.

In ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"" she was about to fight Butters and was waiting for him to pull his pants up, which he refused to do so. It can be assumed that she doesn't like Butters.
In ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", Nelly was seen kissing an unnamed boy in a story on [[Eavesdropper]]. The story was not expanded upon in the episode, so nothing is known about their relationship.

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", Nelly is seen breaking up with [[Francis]] towards the end of the episode.

In ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"", she comments on [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]]'s scrotum coat.

In ""[[World War Zimmerman]]"", she helps [[Eric Cartman]] attempt to stop an imaginary “outbreak” of crazed black people after [[George Zimmerman]] is acquitted of murder. They have a few incidents involving plane and car crashes, until they arrive in Florida. As they part ways, Nelly's mom starts to thank Cartman for what he has done, but is hit by a truck.

She seems to have survived the collision, however, as she appears in non-speaking roles several additional times afterwards.

She has long brown hair that reaches down to her shoulders. She's usually seen wearing a blue shirt with a yellow jacket over it, a short green skirt, and brown boots.

In ""[[World War Zimmerman]]"", she is briefly seen wearing a black jacket while talking to Cartman, before she is rammed by a truck.

Though she does not have a speaking role, she can be seen walking on the streets of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], waiting in line with her husband at the [[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic]] during the quest [[Farts of Future Past]], drunk in front of the garage of the [[Stevens Residence]], drunk in [[Crunchy's Micro Brew]] during [[Mitch Conner]]'s inauguration, and can sometimes be spotted in the bank.

The boys decide to strike back by making up the word 'mung', which is actually a word. The New York Kids mercilessly point out their mistake and rip on them again.

Nichole Daniels,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Nichole_Daniels,,"is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth-grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"". Starting with [[Season Seventeen]], she has made numerous appearances since.

</gallery>

Nichole is the new girl at South Park Elementary, much to the happiness of the [[List of Male 4th Graders|male students]], especially [[Eric Cartman]]. Seeing this as an opportunity for [[Tolkien Black]] to have a girlfriend, Cartman begins a plan to have the two brought together.

Nichole, initially showing interest in [[Kyle Broflovski]], eventually started to like Tolkien, after being locked in the boy's locker room with him for several hours. With aid from Cartman, Nichole and Tolkien formed a strong relationship, until she read the engraving Cartman had put on the tag of one of the stuffed bears from Tolkien. Unbeknownst to Tolkien, the engraving read, ""'Cuz Blacks Belong Together"", which caused Nichole to break up with him, believing they were not on the ""same page"".

Realizing that Nichole was now ""available"", Kyle begins a relationship with her, taking her to a basketball game featuring the Denver Nuggets against the L.A. Clippers. At the game, Cartman sings ""[[I Swear]]"" to Kyle, much to his embarrassment. This causes Kyle to reveal to Nichole that Cartman was the one that set up her and Tolkien. After hearing this, Nichole runs into Tolkien at the game, they reconcile their relationship, and decide to get back together.

Nichole wears black shoes, magenta pants, a white shirt, and a yellow jacket. She has black hair, styled into two buns, and wears two yellow barrettes with pink flowers on them. Sometimes, when she is outside, she wears a pair of pink mittens. According to Wendy, she has minor periorbital puffiness in her eyes.

Nichole is on the [[List of South Park Cows Sports Teams#Cheerleading Squad|cheerleading squad]]; she wears the typical South Park Cows cheerleading attire, which consists of a black and white dress with the word ""cows"" embroidered in the front. While cheerleading, she also wears yellow and pink barrettes, although occasionally she wears two ribbons instead.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', she is seen as an adult woman. She is a very beautiful woman with pronounced cheekbones, large lips applied with lipstick, a pink buttoned shirt, a yellow jacket, and white pants. In addition, she appears with slightly lighter skin and straightened hair.

Nichole is shown to be nice, amiable and sympathetic. She understands Cartman's claims that he and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] were in a relationship in ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"", and despite having a crush on the latter, offers them support. Nichole also appears to get easily embarrassed, as seen when she replies with an ""Oh no"" and an embarrassed look on her face when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] talks to her about about her (former) attraction to Kyle, and when she saw [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] dressed in a towel and runs (or tries to) out the room. She appears to take playful teasing very well. She has also shown to be discreet, being careful in her words and actions not to offend anyone. This is shown when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], posing as a homosexual, asks her not to touch him in the same episode, believing that sexuality influences platonic interactions.

She is also determined, following through with the girls plan to break up with their boyfriends in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", to get back at them for [[Skankhunt42]]'s wrongdoings. She helps [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] convince [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] to do the same, further stating that without all the girls committing, their plan is meaningless.

She may be among the most well behaved children of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], as she has yet to swear (up until ""[[Board Girls]]""), lie, cheat, break a law, or any other form of bad behavior, willingly, so far in the series. She did take part in sighing in an exasperated way at [[Lisa Berger]] in ""[[The Hobbit]]"".

[[File:TokenNichole1.png|200px|thumb|Nichole and [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] meeting in the boys locker room.]]
Nichole and Tolkien began their relationship with each other after being locked inside of the boys locker room for hours. The two's relationship grew stronger, as they were both seen on several dates and visiting amusement parks together. Their relationship was later disrupted by a racist remark and, after learning that Cartman was behind it, Nichole and Tolkien reconciled their relationship.

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", Nichole breaks up with Tolkien due to the actions of internet troll [[Skankhunt42]]; the girls believed that his actions spoke for all the boys.

In ""[[Dead Kids]]"", Nichole tells Cartman that she and Tolkien are trying to make their relationship work again.

Nichole and Kyle both formed a mutual attraction to one another shortly after she arrived at school. However, when Cartman told her he and Kyle were in a homosexual relationship, she chose to back off out of respect; despite this, she still attempted to befriend Kyle. After she briefly ended her relationship with Tolkien, Kyle took her to a basketball game, but any chance of a potential relationship brewing was once again thwarted due to Cartman's intervention. She and Kyle have scarcely interacted afterwards, but it can be presumed they are on friendly terms.

Nichole has occasionally shown an interest in getting Kyle to be more open about his feelings; in her debut episode, she encourages Kyle to talk to her if he feels alone, and in ""[[Doubling Down]], she is the first to inquire that Kyle may have feelings for [[Heidi Turner]].

In ""[[Board Girls]]"" Nichole is revealed to be a big board game buff, along with Stan and minor characters [[Tammy Nelson]] and [[Kelly Pinkerton-Tinfurter]]. While she and Stan never interacted much on screen besides their brief fangirling over BBG, Stan thinks she is cool to play with.

When Nichole and Tammy join the boys' board game club, they have prepared characters for dungeons and dragons together beforehand. This indicates a friendship between the two girls.

Although she did not officially appear in the game, her appearance was planned. She can be seen in promotional artwork for the game. From the promotional artwork, it can be assumed that she would have played a relatively larger role as a cheerleader, along with [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], possibly in a battle against [[Red]], and the stupid Spoiled whores. Her prominence in the game could have been further confirming her permanent role as a part of the series' cast. The reason for her exclusion from the game's final draft is unknown.

Nichole can be found in her bedroom with [[Red McArthur|Red]] on the first day of gameplay, where they are playing cards and talking about  boys. [[The New Kid]] is able to follow her on [[Coonstagram]] and obtain a selfie. Her [[William Daniels|dad]] is falsely accused of being a ""drug dealer"" by [[Harrison Yates]] and arrested during the [[Operation: Just 'Cause]] mission, but after the game's storyline is finished, she and her dad can be found playing cards at the dining room table.

It appears that the decline in his role made him a lot more competent, as in ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"", he arrests a pharmacist for selling drugs to minors, in ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"", he questions the evidence for a ""religious cult"" in [[Mr. Mackey]]'s house party, he realizes his mistake when he gives [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] directions to a sleazy part of town, shows apparent discomfort after helping to kill Britney Spears in ""[[Britney's New Look]]"", and told [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] that South Park was being ravaged in ""[[Pandemic]]"". He also tried to stop the Obama supporters from disturbing the peace in ""[[About Last Night...]]"", but fails and his patrol car gets tipped over by rowdy supporters.

He appeared more often during episodes in [[Season Fourteen]] with him being relatively prominent in ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"", ""[[200]]"", and ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"".

Barbrady was illiterate until the episode ""[[Chickenlover]]"" when the [[Book Mobile Driver|Chickenlover]] enacted a plot to make him read by having sex with chickens. Barbrady was also sent to school to learn how to read by the [[Mayor McDaniels|Mayor]]. The Chickenlover made Barbrady learn where he would strike next by reading the clues left at the crime scenes. When the arrest was finally made, Barbrady acted gratefully to the Chickenlover, but had to arrest him nonetheless for being a gallophile. Chickenlover then gave him the book ''Atlas Shrugged'' which Barbrady thought was ""a load of crap"" and made him realize reading is ""a waste of his time"".

He wears a traditional blue police officer's uniform, and black sunshades. He appears to be slightly overweight. Barbrady is likely near deaf; he wears a hearing aid and speaks in a loud, expressionless manner. Of note, he has not been seen without the sunglasses except during the ending of ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", but his eyes, mouth and cheeks are changed due to the alien control and so it was unknown what he looked like without his sunglasses until ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"" where he was forced to give up his police belongings including his sunglasses. He now wears a brown jacket over a blue dress shirt and gray trousers.

Officer Barbrady fits the personality of an oaf: unintelligent, willing to use unnecessary force, etc. He is illiterate and illogical, and is prone to make foolish decisions, often making the incident even worse. He regularly insists that ""there's nothing to see here!"" in the events of crimes or other unusual occurrences. However, in ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"", he does appear to have a compassionate side. When he is fired as policeman and returns home to his dog, he promises her that he will get another job in order to pay for her medicine.

Despite being a cop himself, Barbrady has committed a few crimes in the series.

[[File:MrsBarbrady.png|thumb|Picture of Mrs. Barbrady in ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"".]]
In ""[[Chickenlover]]"", Barbrady is revealed to have a [[Mrs. Barbrady|wife]]. She is mentioned again in ""[[Spookyfish]]"". However, she has yet to appear and is seldom mentioned. In ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"", a picture of her is shown hanging in Barbrady's apartment; she never appeared physically in the episode which suggests that she either divorced Barbrady or died.

In ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"", he is shown to live alone with his very elderly sick dog who he called by an affectionate name.

Many episodes which feature both Barbrady and Mayor McDaniels, it is implied that they are in a relationship - in ""[[Pinkeye]]"", they are seen ""not wearing any pants"" (Barbrady in lingerie) and McDaniels shirt open, insisting to Chef it has ""nothing to do with the Japanese mafia"". In ""[[Summer Sucks]]"", McDaniels is at her desk when suddenly Barbrady's voices comes up asking where the ""little man in the boat"" is. McDaniels tells him to keep looking and at the end of the scene, swoons when he says he's found him. Despite this, in ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", McDaniels is seen reading ""Jugs"" and in ""[[The Coon]]"", Cartman questions the Mayor's sexuality, implying that their relationship is secret.

Also, despite the fact that Barbrady is generally portrayed as a bumbling oaf, the Mayor still tended to call on him up until [[Season Seven]]. This is due to the fact that until then he was the ''only'' officer in the town.

In ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"" it is revealed that Barbrady takes care of an elderly female dog.

Officer Barbrady can be found standing just outside [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]]. Speak to him for a Facebook friend.

He can be found in [[City Wok]]. He will follow you on Coonstagram after taking a selfie. He also appears in [[The Peppermint Hippo]] during [[The Bowels of the Beast]] mission, interacting with the [[Strippers]].

Old Farmer,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Farmer,,"is an old man who occasionally advises [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] citizens on their problems, though rarely involved in them himself. He is based on the character Jud Crandall from the 1989 horror film ''Pet Sematary'', based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King.

He first appears when [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] passed by his shop while lost in ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"". Butters asks him which road to take to go back to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. The old farmer then points to a cursed road, and begin describing its horrible history, reciting a quote from the book, ""A lot of history on that road"". The cursed road also appears in ''Pet Sematary''.

He reappears in ""[[Asspen]]"" where he warns [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] about how dangerous skiing the [[K-13]] would be, saying there was a 'wolf boy' who escaped from a mental institution up there as well as the mountain being a burial ground cursed by vampire cannibalistic Indians named the 'Witchicaw' who ate the flesh of little children.

His third appearance was in ""[[Marjorine]]"". After Butters faked his death, the farmer comes to his parents' house, telling [[Stephen Stotch]] not to try to bring his son back by burying his body in the [[Indian Burial Ground]], quoting ""Sometimes dead is better"". Unfortunately, he is the one who gives Stephen the idea.

He reappears again in ""[[Insecurity]]"" at the bar when the fathers try to decide how to deal with the UPS man who is supposedly sleeping with their wives. The farmer compares the UPS man to a milkman he once knew and tells them they should kill him, and insists it's the only way. Later, he makes the same comparison to the security staff.

He later appears in ""[[The Damned]]"", running a farm. When Randy Marsh talks to him to learn more about the Member Berries, the farmer tells him how popular the member berries are and how he had to remove several of his other crops to make room for them.

He again returns in ""[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]"" as an employee, possibly a curator at the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science|Natural History Museum]], warning Butters to not put the Mummy Stamp into his book, if not, a curse would be unleashed upon him.

He seems to be caring, to some extent, warning Butters of the dangers of going down a certain road in ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", as well as warning [[Stephen Stotch]] of the dangers of burying his son in the [[Indian Burial Ground]] in ""[[Marjorine]]"". However, the advice he gives almost always scares the person he is talking to more than it comforts them. Usually discussing monsters, or other horrific supernatural occurrences in the place he is talking about. His advice also always causes more problems than it could possibly solve, such as advising men concerned about the UPS man sleeping with their wives to commit murder, or warning [[Stephen Stotch]] about the horrific consequences of reviving his son in an ancient Indian Burial Ground when Stotch did not even know that the graveyard existed, making it possible for him to revive Butters.

The old farmer has gray hair, thick eyebrows, and has many wrinkles on his face, his eyes appear to be smaller than most adult characters, he also has a very wide mouth. He originally wore a dark blue shirt with rolled-up sleeves underneath a lighter blue overall. His overall had two pockets, one to the left and one to the right, there were also two black stains on the overall. Underneath his overall, he wore a white undershirt. He also wore black shoes and a yellow hat.

From ""[[Insecurity]]"" onwards, he was redesigned. His hat and shoes are now more detailed, as are his face and hair. He no longer wears a visible white undershirt and his overall now also has more details. The two pockets are now one central pocket and there are no longer stains to be found. He is shown to be taller than other adults in previous seasons.

The old farmer returns in the video game. He can be seen at the [[Hillvale Farm]] on the edge of town. He is blocking the path to [[Canada]] and will warn the player not to go back there, giving a disturbing backstory of the area. The player can pass using TimeFart Pause to push a barrel next to him and thus preventing him from moving. Once they do this and enter Canada, he will let them pass whenever they wish.

The old farmer has a role in the [[Bring the Crunch]] DLC, he serves as the narrator and the guide for the team. He can also be befriended after the story ends, going by the title ""Old Mechanic"".

She is also one of the rich celebrities contacted by [[Tolkien Black]] in the episode ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"".

They are shown to be sentient entities, with Mingey even holding a gun in ""[[A Million Little Fibers]]"". It is unknown how they came to be sentient.

After their plans to get Oprah fired fail, Mingey holds a group of fans hostage, including [[Towelie (Character)|Towelie]]. Gary was later shot by a police sniper, and as a result, Mingey kills himself to his dismay.

Orlich has short, blond hair. He wears a black shirt, what appears to be a bulletproof vest, and gray pants. He also has on black-framed glasses, what appears to be a bluetooth earpiece, and a watch on his left wrist.

In ""[[Super Fun Time]]"" he was shown to be in a group of thieves with Franz, however, their relationship seemed business-only, considering Orlich didn't trust that Franz would give him his ""cut"" of their stolen goods.

Osama bin Laden,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden,,"was the founder and former leader of [[al-Qaeda]] and a major antagonist. Throughout the series, he has been portrayed as ""completely insane"". He was voiced by [[Trey Parker]].

He made his first appearance on the show in ""[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]"", when [[The Boys]] go to [[Afghanistan]], in order to return a goat given to them by [[The Afghan Boys|Afghan children]]. The Boys are later taken by terrorists who tie them up as hostages before Osama bin Laden was introduced, recording a video threatening to kill the kids and goat. U. S. soldiers, believing the goat is Stevie Nicks, engage in a battle with al-Qaeda at Osama's hideout. The Afghan boys free our boys, but leave Cartman behind, insisting he knows how to deal with him. The two go through a long routine inspired by Warner Bros. shorts produced during World War II, Cartman humiliating him in several cartoonish ways, later leaving him dazed and defeated. A soldier then executes him.

Despite his apparent death in the previous episode, bin Laden reappeared in ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"" as a member of the Legion of Doom, but he does not have any lines. In [[Cartoon Wars Part II|the Cartoon Wars duology]], bin Laden reappears using live-action footage from then-recently released videos, using subtitles to change his dialogue. He threatened great harm to America if ''[[Family Guy]]'' showed the holy Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]], but ultimately after the prophet is shown, bin Laden, al-Zawahri, and al-Qaeda respond only with a video of Americans, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Jesus]] crapping on each other.

He later reappears as part of a class-action lawsuit against the town of South Park in ""[[200]]"" with other celebrities, though he does not talk. Not long after, he reappeared once more with a new, cleaned-up design in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"". [[Randy Marsh]] sends him a video asking for help in defeating the Jerseys, playing the theme song for the show ''Jersey Shore'' to bin Laden. After South Park runs out of ammo, he responds with several al-Qaeda suicide bombers who destroyed the Jerseyites. Jersey pushed back, the entire town honors bin Laden - before a U.S. soldier takes him out, causing Randy to proclaim ""We got him!""

Just seven months after being shot in the head by a Paratrooper in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan through a shot to the head on May 1, 2011. In another parallel, Randy's response in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"" is identical to that given by [[Barack Obama]] (""We got him!""). ""[[Funnybot]]"" and ""[[Royal Pudding]]"" include many subtle references, including a sketch in [[Funnybot (Character)|Funnybot]]'s writing room and Obama's speeches (though about Funnybot and later [[Tyler Perry]]) and in the latter, the response to [[Tooth Decay]]'s death.

Osama wore a white [[wikipedia:Taqiyah (cap)|taqiyah]], an oversized white robe, and a light gray shirt. He also had comically oversized ears, as well as an oversized nose, oversized lips, and small eyes.

Osama bin Laden was a terrorist, meaning that he was willing to use violence to cause death and destruction and spread fear for personal gain. He was shown to have a strongly Anti-American ideology which reflected in his various terrorist atrocities committed against the country. He is depicted as utterly insane and deranged, speaking in gibberish and being impervious to logic and reason.

They enjoy drinking beer, ""checking others' privilege"" by using shaming and bullying tactics, and ""crushing puss"".

At college bar [[Crunchy's Micro Brew]], [[Randy Marsh]], [[Gerald Broflovski]], [[Stuart McCormick]], [[Ryan Valmer]], and [[Stephen Stotch]] discuss [[PC Principal]] and [[Caitlyn Jenner]]. They are accosted by a few men who all identify as politically correct (PC) and are forced to refer to Caitlyn as ""stunning and brave"". Finding that they are all like-minded, they decide to form a PC fraternity and move in together to the [[PC Delta]].

There is a non-stop party at the PC Delta with PC bros acting like they are still in college. The party keeps Randy up at night, so he goes over to attempt to reason with [[PC Principal]] about the noise. However, the PC bros think that he is here to join their fraternity and they force him to participate in a fraternity hazing pledge ritual. They successfully brainwash him with their PC views. After making it to the final cuts, Randy and the PC bros are tasked to check [[Kyle Broflovski]]'s privilege, who had called Caitlyn Jenner a phony. They break into [[Broflovski Residence|his house]] at night and shame him by waking him to a room full of pigs painted with the word ""Biggit"".

In a bid to get rid of the PC bros and PC Principal, [[Eric Cartman]] and his friends later attack the PC Delta with [[200 Pregnant Mexican Women|200 pregnant Mexican women]], taco launchers, [[Syrian refugee children]], and [[Jared Fogle]]. However, he fails to get rid of them; the PC bros credit the use of offensive imagery and outrageous stereotypes to successfully provoke Kyle to open his eyes.

In ""[[Sponsored Content]]"", the PC bros throw a party at the PC Delta for people with disabilities. But for the most part, the event is mostly about the PC bros ""scoring"" with chicks instead of actually raising awareness. The next morning, PC Principal collects consent forms from each of the bros who have ""scored"" the previous time. The PC bros also freak out multiple times in the episode about being mocked by the [[Super School News|school newspaper]]. They put up  yellow tape saying ""[[Safe Space|SAFE SPACE]] - DO NOT CROSS"" over the PC Delta while they figure it out.

The name uses Greek letters ΡΩΔ (''Rho-Omega-Delta'') in imitation of real Greek Fraternities. The omega is turned on the side resembling a C and the Delta resembles an A. The name could be an acronym of ''Politically Correct Assholes'' or ROD another names for being a ""Dick"" or a bully.

Most of the PC bros are young white men fresh out of college, with the exception of PC Principal and Randy Marsh.

He makes friends with [[PC Principal]] and agrees to hang out at the [[PC Delta]] with the other PC Bros. At the end of the episode, he brandishes Randy's ass with the PC logo.

He also appears in ""[[Sponsored Content]]"", alongside the other PC Bros after [[Jimmy Valmer]] writes a story in the [[Super School News|school newspaper]] using the word ""retarded"" and sitting after Jimmy writes another story about ""PC"" standing for ""pussy crushing"".

He has long blonde hair and thin blonde eyebrows. He wears a blue short-sleeve shirt, a black belt, black pants, and black sneakers. He also appears muscular and has a cleft chin.

PC Principal,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/PC_Principal,,"Before giving his debut speech as the new principal of South Park Elementary, he drinks from a plastic bottle and casually tosses it aside.
*'''Assault and Battery:''' He viciously beats up Cartman in the bathroom severely to the brink of death, primarily for using the term ""spokesman"" (instead of ""spokesperson""), resulting in Cartman's hospitalization at [[Hells Pass Hospital]] temporarily.
*'''Hazing:''' The PC Delta fraternity engages in typical fraternity hazing practices, such as branding pledges with hot metal (for example, [[Randy Marsh]]). Many states have legislation prohibiting this behavior. Since he is in charge of this fraternity branch, the responsibility lies on him to prevent this behavior, and thus, he is criminally responsible for hazing.
*'''Assault/Burglary/Indirect Hate Crime:''' Ordered fellow frats to harass Kyle in his sleep and leave pigs - animals which are not Kosher and thus offensive to his Jewish heritage - in his room. The fact that PC Principal used non-kosher animals to shame Kyle for insulting [[Caitlyn Jenner]] means that its possible PC Principal is anti-semitic. Kyle also wakes up with shaved hair and penises drawn on his face.
*'''Child Labor/Forced Labor:''' In ""[[Safe Space]]"", he forces [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to filter various people's social media accounts to get rid of negativity and shaming comments. The amount of work involved drove him to commit suicide. His suicide attempt failed but resulted in injuries that appear in every episode in Season 19. Though he regrets making Butters do this, Randy Marsh comes up with a solution that is even worse, by forcing starving African children to do the same.
*'''Abuse'''/'''Misuse of the Emergency Number (911):''' Called the police for a ""Code Red"", which turns out to be [[Leslie Meyers|Leslie]] merely interrupting an assembly. The Police, interpreting ""Code Red"" as an active shooter situation, entered the gym with their guns drawn, which ended near-tragically when he shined a laser-pointer into [[Officer Barbrady]]'s face, causing him to panic and open fire, hitting one of the students. It turns out he only called in the police to remove Leslie from the School. This counts as both misuse and abuse of the emergency number 911.
*'''Threatening to Endanger the Life of a Minor/Infirm:''' Threatens to 'break the legs"" of the student who used the term ""retarded"" in the school newspaper. However, when the student turns out to be [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], he chose not to carry out the threat and instead spoke with him in his office over the matter.
**'''Terrorism:''' Used the threat of violence numerous times to encourage people to adhere to his PC ideology (i.e. The incident with Cartman, threatening to break legs over the use of the word ""retarded"" in the newspaper.)
*'''Murder''': In ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"" he murders several Russians and later kills Leslie Meyers, who were depicted as robotic advertisements in human form. In these instances, however, it could be considered self-defense, as all his victims were robotic advertisements in human form or their status as non-humans could also exclude it.

PC Principal is the current principal at South Park Elementary. He replaced [[Principal Victoria]] after she was allegedly fired, ostensibly because she did not take action against a student referring to rape as a ""Hot Cosby"". He is also an Alumni member of the [[PC Bros]] fraternity and an alumnus of the Texas A&M University.

Though he is initially portrayed as an antagonist, particularly towards [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and anyone else who is not ""PC"", he mellows out significantly in the middle of the season. He is eventually revealed to merely be a pawn in the grand scheme of things, which causes him to become a protagonist in the season's final episode, ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"".

In ""[[Back To The Cold War]]"", it is revealed that he studied in West High (2000-2004) and Texas A&M University (2004-2008).

PC Principal has committed several crimes already in his so far short prominence, several of them only in his debut episode.
PC Principal has dirty blond hair and a beard, slightly resembling [[Stuart McCormick]]. He visibly had a mustache, which is now stubble. He wears a blue polo shirt, khaki pants, and dark, sporty sunglasses in which he is rarely seen without them off, only in ""[[Stunning and Brave]]"" and at the conclusion of ""[[Sponsored Content]]"". He is heavily implied to be a fitness enthusiast and looks noticeably more realistic than the other characters in terms of build.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he appears to have gained some weight. He has balding gray hair and goatee, and wears a gray South Park Cows sweatshirt, blue gym shorts, and white sport shoes.

PC Principal is, as the name suggests, dedicated to political correctness and social justice causes. He is a maniacal idealist who passionately supports equal rights for all--little does he realize that this is inherently impossible and self contradictory--often to the point of behaving extremely rudely, violently, even outright bullying and criminally menacing to anyone who shows even the slightest perceived sign of intolerance of any kind. He is therefore prone to aggressive, profane outbursts over minor transgressions, such as [[Leslie Meyers|a student]] talking during an assembly (or even when she isn't). He is highly dedicated to his beliefs, despite themselves being inherently and drastically intolerant, and will stop at nothing to enforce them upon others. He can also become very sensitive to the needs of those he feels are oppressed, even if they don't feel it as such (as in the case of [[Jimmy Valmer]]) or when he's being clearly manipulated (as in the case of [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Butters|Leopold Stotch]]).

PC Principal generally believes in using punishment to achieve his ends, such as up to two weeks of detention, such as when Butters correcting him when the former was talking about [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]], or for not helping Eric Cartman feed out bad tweets. He even gives the faculty detention, giving [[Mr. Mackey]] two days of detention for using the term ""Black"" instead of African American. When he feels pushed further, he has resorted to bullying, violence and threats as a form of manipulation, beating up Cartman and breaking several of his bones. He also fires [[Herbert Garrison]] for a display of racism during an assembly, after previously being warned. In this situation, the firing was justifiable, as Mr. Garrison was openly insulting all Canadians.

He, and all his PC Bros, are loud and obnoxious, often being characterized as stereotypical ""frat guys"" with an uncommon awareness of social justice issues, and they describe themselves as loving ""beer, working out, and.. social justice"". They are perfectly prepared to stand up for equal rights by whatever means they feel are justified. PC Principal has a wide range of knowledge of equal rights and political correctness issues and initially seems willing to scare and beat anyone who does not share his views, demonstrating signs of mental instability. Unlike his bros, he does not seem interested in sexual conquests or ""pussy crushing"".

Despite his violence towards those who disagree with him, PC Principal appears to be relatively mellow and relaxed when he feels he has won out and can be very patient in these situations. He admits that he feels he has changed South Park successfully in ""[[The City Part of Town]]"" and appears proud of the town. He can also be somewhat forgiving, as he seems to hold no ill will against Cartman in later episodes in the season, and is very sympathetic towards him when he is bullied in ""[[Safe Space]]"", and later realizes and admits to his mistake by putting too much pressure on Butters.

In ""[[Sponsored Content]]"" it is shown that he is uncomfortable with handicapped people, such as Jimmy Valmer. After threatening to ""break the legs"" of the editor of the school newspaper because a student used the word 'retarded', he was stunned to discover a handicapped child had agreed to it, and had trouble discussing the issue with him. This is because threatening a handicapped with violence, which he does with everyone, would violate his PC ethics. Thus handicapped people disarm him of his only method of getting his way. He acknowledges the use of a ""micro-aggression"" to his PC frat brothers in the same episode.

After the ad conspiracy, PC Principal seems to cease and relax his prejudice against straight white men as they are now considered just as disenfranchised by ads as every other group, and is not depicted reacting violently to South Park students anymore so far.

He is also seemingly a feminist as he beats up Eric for saying ""Spokesman"" instead of ""Spokesperson"", accusing him of ""Abusing his male privileges.""

P. Diddy,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/P._Diddy,,"is an American rapper who appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode, ""[[Douche and Turd]]"". 

[[Kyle Broflovski]] hires P. Diddy to persuade an indifferent [[Stan Marsh]] by instilling the fear of violence to make him vote for a new [[Giant Douche|school mascot]]. P. Diddy performed his song ""[[Vote or Die!]]"" in a video montage of him and his gang violently chasing Stan, threatening to slit his throat and having five guns pointed at Stan while using profanity.

After he is banished from the town for not voting, he is then sent on a donkey with a bucket over his head when they come onto a [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] community. P. Diddy and his crew somehow locate him to follow through on his threats. Then, A PETA member throws pig blood on him for wearing fur. Enraged, he gives his group the signal to start slaughtering everyone. A stray bullet ended up hitting Stan in his shoulder.

P. Diddy appears to favor violence to get his way with others and murders a group of people for having different ideals about love than himself. Seems to really care about voting even to the point of murder. When about to rap he speaks like a typical rapper, but when talking to his posse he speaks with a regal and posh accent.

P. Diddy, as he appeared in ""[[Douche and Turd]]"", wears all white clothing. He wears a large fur coat, a branded white t-shirt, and white pants. He also wears dark brown sunglasses with gold frames. He has trimmed black hair and a trimmed beard. He can be seen wielding a black pistol.

Pablo,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Pablo,,"was a tour guide who appeared in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]"".

In the episode, the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir travels to [[Costa Rica]] to sing about rainforest awareness and conservation at the Save the Rain Forest summit. The [[Costa Rican President]] sends them on a tour of the rainforest headed by Pablo.

During the tour, Pablo shows the choir group various animals in the rainforest. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] sees a coral snake and screams in fear. Pablo mistakenly states that ""they're more scared of us than we are of them"". The snake promptly attacks and swallows him whole, killing him.

Following Pablo's death, the group is now lost in the rainforest, very scared. They find themselves in many life-threatening situations until they are rescued by [[Foreman|American builders]]. They make it back to the rainforest summit just in time for their performance.

Pablo has short black hair, a visible nose and ears, wrinkles on his forehead, and a mustache. He wears a dark blue collared shirt with two chest pockets, a dull green belt with a large buckle, brown pants with knee pockets, and black shoes. He carries a dark green sling bag slung from his left shoulder. He holds a large hunting knife in his left hand, likely to defend himself against danger in the rainforest. He can speak English, unlike the President.

Pandemic Specialists,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Pandemic_Specialists,,"are a team of scientists investigating [[COVID-19]] in the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"".

In the episode, the [[Chief Scientist]] takes the pandemic specialists on a tour of the [[South Park Viral Research Center]]. During the tour, the chief scientist shows them the [[Pangolin]] that started the pandemic. He explains that they have found that another species inserted its DNA up the pangolin which enabled COVID-19 to spread to humans. They need to obtain that DNA (which unknown to them, is [[Randy Marsh]]'s DNA) in order to develop a vaccine. Randy somehow manages to sneak into the tour with the group. Upon hearing the chief scientist's theory, the pandemic specialists start laughing at the idea of another species having sex with the pangolin because it is so ugly. 

When the group moves off to view the containment labs, Randy kidnaps the pangolin to prevent the scientists from finding out that he is responsible for the transmission of COVID-19 to humans.

They are of varying appearances but they all wear white lab coats and hold clip boards. A few of them wear glasses.

Pangolin,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Pangolin,,"After [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] believes he started the [[COVID-19]] pandemic from having intercourse with a [[bat]] in [[China]], he watches a news report where a group of pandemic specialists was able to find out where the virus started, revealing that it started not from a bat, but rather from a Pangolin. Randy realizes that he also had intercourse with the Pangolin and sets out to [[South Park Viral Research Center]] to steal the pangolin from the specialists so he doesn't get caught.

The specialists soon find out that the Pangolin was stolen and set out to find it so they can get a cure for the pandemic. Later on, Randy brings the Pangolin to [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] so the specialists can find the cure, but it is taken by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], who was about to put it through the Do-Over A Bear machine at the workshop so he doesn't have to go back to school. However, he spares the Pangolin's life after [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] gives a speech about wanting the world to go back to normal. He gives the Pangolin back to the head specialist, but both the specialist and the Pangolin were set on fire and killed by [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] with a flamethrower, who asks people to vote for him as the South Park residents run and scream in fear.

Paris Hilton,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Paris_Hilton,,"is a celebrity who appears in the [[Season Eight]] episode, ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"".

After opening her latest store at the [[South Park Mall]], ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore]]"", Paris prepares to make weekend plans involving sex and drinking but is cut off after her dog [[Tinkerbell]] commits suicide. Horrified she screams that ""another dog killed itself!"" while her limo driver half-heartedly attempts to calm her down, promising her another dog. However, she is easily distracted from her mourning, upon catching sight of [[Butters Stotch]] playing with some apples. Thinking him to be more of a pet than a person, she claims that she wants ""it"". Butters misunderstands her, thinking she wants to be his girlfriend, while the limo driver attempts to tell Paris that Butters is a child, not property. Paris begins to throw a tantrum, screaming ""I want it! I want it!"" and the driver relents, ordering Butters to get into the car, while Paris happily declares to have a bear costume made for him and dubbing him ""Mr. Biggles"".

They go back to the [[Stotch Residence]], where Paris offers to purchase Butters from them. [[Linda Stotch]] is less pleased with the idea, first grounding Butters for dating Paris, and also finding the idea of selling her son to the heiress unseemly. [[Stephen Stotch]] however feels the opposite, claiming that Paris will give him a better life and that they should think about their personal needs over their son's. While they discuss this, Butters takes Paris up to his room, where she passes out and where he begins poking her vagina. Stephen managed to convince Linda to sell Butters, which Butters pleads against. The deal is made, however, and Butters prepares to resign himself to his life with Paris. After seeing a photo album though of all her past pets having killed themselves, Butters runs away, where he ends up hiding at [[Bebe Stevens]]' ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"" sex party. Paris follows him there, where she hears [[Mr. Slave]] warning the girls of South Park against being like Paris Hilton, claiming she is thoughtless and talentless and that being a whore is not fun but something bad (knowing from personal experience, having been a whore his whole life). Furious, Paris claims being a whore is the ideal life and proceeds to challenge Mr. Slave to a ""Whore-Off"" to see who's a bigger whore, claiming that Mr. Slave does not know what true ""partying"" is.

[[File:SSWVP76.png|thumb|left|Paris Hilton stuck inside of [[Mr. Slave]]'s ass.]]
At the competition, Paris proceeds to make out with the [[Chamber of Commerce Representative|Master of Ceremonies]], dance with large scantily clad muscle men, and to top it all off, stuff a pineapple up her vagina. Everyone believes her to be the winner, as Mr. Slave just sits there watching her in mild boredom. However, he wins the competition, by stuffing Paris all the way up his own ass. The town explodes in celebration of Mr. Slave's victory, however, he silences them and informs them that what he and Paris do is a bad thing and that parents are supposed to teach their children that people like Paris and himself should be despised, not praised, and emulated. The town comes to realize that he's right. Meanwhile, inside Mr. Slave's rectum, Paris is greeted by the [[Frog King]] from ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", who urges her to escape the gay man's ass or else she will die.

[[File:Paris_Hilton.jpg|thumb|right|Paris' cameo in ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]""]]
Paris managed to survive and escape Mr. Slave's anus, as she was again seen as a background character in the episode ""[[Britney's New Look]]"". She also made a slightly larger cameo appearance in ""[[200]]"", in which she joins with other [[Celebrities]] in a plot against the people of South Park, for all the times they have mocked or humiliated them. Paris claims to have suffered the worse mocking from the town for being a whore, at which point she coughs up more semen and wipes it on [[John Travolta]]'s crotch. She appears again in the follow-up episode ""[[201]]"", where the celebrities kidnap [[Muhammad]] so as to steal his power of not being mocked.

Like the real Paris Hilton, she is an unhealthy looking girl, dangerously underweight, with a large roman nose, overly tanned skin, and bleach blonde hair. Her purple eye shadowed eyes are uneven as one is more heavily lidded than the other, which may either be natural or the result of constantly being intoxicated. She also has large, overly painted pink lips. She also wears a bling necklace with her name. She has long pink nails and blue stud earrings. She wears a short, transparent pink crop top and under that is a white bra (or bikini). She also wears a short blue denim skirt and a green thong. On her feet, she wears fuchsia ankle-high boots. She constantly throws up globs of semen. She is the South Park stereotype of a whore: skimpy clothes and a desire to have sex with males.

The team competes in the [[Pee-Wee Hockey League]]. One of their members, Nelson, has cancer and expects the team to win the match. He counts on Stan to help train the team to win. Due to his medical condition, Stan assigns [[Ike Broflovski]] onto the team to substitute  for Nelson for the teams' next big match against the Denver Pee-Wee Hockey Team.

At their first game, they compete against the [[Adams County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]]. During the match, the players are shown to be very incompetent in the sport. None of the players made a score, and the game ends in a tie.

Later in the episode, after the team arrives at the stadium, the opponent team fails to show up. Instead, the [[Colorado Avalanche]] make the pee-wee team play for them against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].

The Kindergartners were severely injured due to their opponents being adults who are a lot taller, more experienced, and physically-shaped. As a result of their loss, Nelson loses hope and dies in his hospital bed. 

''Note: All members listed are non-contemporaneous.''
The Park County uniform consists of a green helmet, white jerseys, and green gloves. Their gear is of the brand CLK.

Paul Watson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Paul_Watson,,"is a Canadian animal rights activist, appearing as Captain of the ""Sea Shepherd"" in the episode ""[[Whale Whores]]"". He is up against the Japanese, who have been killing dolphins and whales. The person he is based on in real life, hosts a television show of his own, called ''[[Whale Wars]]''.

In a parody of his controversial methods, involving the misrepresentation of events, to deceive the audience, Watson is depicted as an idiotic, glory-hound in search of getting attention for his show in the most pathetic means possible. When faced with an actual Japanese whaling ship, he suggests that they beat themselves up, in order to lie about being attacked. He also suggests that the crew throw rancid butter at the Japanese ship. After the butter is thrown, Watson is killed when a harpoon, shot from the Japanese ship, goes through his head, pinning him to the wall. This caused [[Stan Marsh]] to step up and take over command of the ship. Stan then shoots the Japanese boat's fuel supply with a flare gun, thus blowing it up and causing it to sink. Stan's more proactive approach to anti-whaling made him a more popular TV persona than Paul Watson.

Watson later appeared in episodes ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"" alive, as part of the group of celebrities filing a class action lawsuit against [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].

Paul Watson is grossly overweight. He wears olive colored cargo pants, black boots, a black belt, and a black hoodie sweater with a white skull design. He has white hair and a white mustache. Due to his weight, his blood flow is inhibited, causing redness on his nose and cheeks.

Paul Watson is portrayed as dishonest, hypocritical and incompetent. He seeks to gain notoriety with his cause with nonsensical methods, with the only aim of seeking to gain public attention, meaning he is very self-obsessed and fame-hungry rather than being truly concerned with his supposed environmental cause.

Despite being a Canadian, he was not depicted like other Canadians in ''[[South Park]]''. Instead of having an egg-shaped flapping head like, for example [[Ike Broflovski]], he is fully defined with a normal head. The same applies to [[Tom Green]], [[Alanis Morissette]], the [[Star Wars Kid]], [[Justin Bieber]], and [[James Cameron]].

On ''South Park'', he is portrayed similarly, but may be somewhat more of a slacker who gets involved in foolish and nonsensical acts, mainly parodying Family Guy's infamous cutaway gags.

In ""[[Timmy 2000]]"", Collins, who is always seen clutching an Oscar, is upset with [[The Lords of the Underworld]] because of the way they use [[Timmy]] in their band. He successfully breaks up the band by convincing [[Skyler]] that Timmy is stealing his thunder. He allows Skyler's new solo band, [[Reach for the Skyler]], to perform at [[Lalapalalapaza|his concert]]. After the kids are taken off [[Ritalin]] at the festival, Collins is promptly booed off the stage. While The Lords of The Underworld begin playing, he is thrown around in the audience and his Oscar is shoved up his ass.

At the concert, Collins sings a parody of ""You'll Be in My Heart"", as the creators' revenge for ""[[Blame Canada]]"" from ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' losing the Oscar to Collins - the reason being that, while Stone and Parker were prepared to lose the Academy Award for Best Original Song, they were not prepared to lose it to Phil Collins.

He is very arrogant, vengeful, and manipulative. He shows off his Oscar wherever he goes, even though his music shown to be terrible when he performs. He goes out of his way and uses dishonest means to get what he wants. He outwardly expresses his displeasure at Timmy joining the Lords of the Underworld, claiming that people are making fun of him for being handicapped, but it is likely that he is just jealous of the band's success. He goes to extreme measures to break up the band; first by visiting Timmy's parents and later convincing Skyler to leave the band by making him believe that Timmy is stealing his fame. 

Phil Collins wears a white long-sleeved shirt, jeans, and can be seen holding an Oscar trophy. He has a noticeable 5 o'clock shadow, visible signs of aging, and has receding brown hair. He is almost always scowling.

Phillip's Replacement,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Phillip%27s_Replacement,,"is a replacement actor for [[Terrance and Phillip|Phillip]] who appears in the [[Season Five]] episode ""[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]"".

When [[The Boys]] go to the Denver Coliseum to see Terrance and Phillip live in person, they are disappointed to find out that Phillip has been replaced by a different non-Canadian actor, although [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] seems to think he is funny. This causes them to visit with Terrance to find out why Phillip was replaced.

The replacement and Terrance are seen performing an act that parodies the ""Who's on First?"" sketch from ''Abbot and Costello''.

Phillip's replacement appears almost identical to the real Phillip, having blonde hair, a light blue shirt with the letter ""P"" written on it, gray pants, and black shoes. However, the biggest difference is he is not Canadian, thus he doesn't have the typical features of Canadians on the show, such as a flappy head and beady eyes.

Pi-Pi,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Pi-Pi,,"was the owner of [[Pi Pi's Splashtown]] in ""[[Pee]]"".

Pi-Pi initially shows absolutely no concern about the amount of urine in his water park and, in fact, seems almost unaffected by urine altogether. He claims that the canals of Venice are mostly composed of urine and since he grew up in it with no ill effects, urine must be harmless. So when the scientists tell him to close down his water park, Pi-Pi refuses.

When the park is flooded by pee, Pi-Pi is washed away. He later appears on the mountain-like structure that [[the boys]] are trapped on, showing remorse for ignoring the scientists' pleas. Pi-Pi tells them about the release valve, submerged below the pee. He states that he cannot reach it because he cannot swim, despite the fact he runs a water park, and that he told the scientists that he learned how to swim in Venice a few scenes ago. Pi-Pi makes [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] agree to swim to the valve, and then claims he needs to drink pee in order to stabilize the water pressure so he does not get the bends. He makes Kyle drink an entire glass of pee, but before they can begin the mission, the rescue helicopters arrive.

He appears once more in ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars]]'' as the special's main antagonist. He subscribes to [[Steve Black|Steve Black's]] subscription streaming service in order to get water for his park during a drought. When Steve approaches him to ask for the water rights back, Pi-Pi refuses, revealing that he had been working with the [[Water Commissioner|water commissioner]] and [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]]. Later, he discusses the streaming wars with the water commissioner. Pi-Pi's final plan is discovered, that being to sell urine to the city once all the water runs out; Pi-Pi then has ManBearPig kill the water commissioner.

Subsequently in ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars Part 2]]'', he starts his own streaming service titled ""Pi-Pi+"" and reopens his water park which has been filled with 100% urine. As part of his marketing plan, he hires celebrities such as Matt Damon and Reese Witherspoon to advertise his streaming service, coercing them to consume their meals prepared with urine. After [[Randy Marsh|Karen]] reveals his whole scheme, ManBearPig decapitates Pi-Pi, killing him instantly.

Pi-Pi is a short, dark-haired, mustachioed man from Venice, [[Italy]]. He usually speaks of himself in the third person and seems to have the overall appearance of a standard Italian stereotype.

Pip Pirrip,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Pip_Pirrip,,"""Cheerio! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you would mind not smashing our little town into bits."" from ""[[201]]""

[[File:Metrosexual Pip.png|thumb|left|Pip in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]""]]
Pip told [[the Boys]] in ""[[Summer Sucks]]"" that his parents were dead. However, in the previous season, during the episode ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"", he was seen caroling along with a British-looking family in America. It is assumed by fans that this family adopted him, or were instead some of his other close relatives.

Before coming to South Park, he attended Stratfordshire Primary in Stratford, England (though in the episode ""[[Pip]]"", it was shown that he was briefly educated in London), where he excelled in archery.

During the first three seasons, Pip was a very prominent character and usually served as the ""tortured guinea pig"" of the kids, being bullied mercilessly. However, his role diminished dramatically after [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' introduction, as Butters claimed more and more of the parts for his own character. After his own episode during the fourth season, Pip was rarely seen afterward, usually in class or playing with other boys. He made one last speaking appearance in ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", being among the final six of the boys' potential friends. Ironically, the last lines they speak to him are ''""Pip, get the fudge out!""''.

In some episodes, such as ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", Pip was missing entirely, and then disappeared midway through ""[[D-Yikes!]]"", his seat being empty for the remainder of the episode. No mention or reason for his disappearance was shown. He also did not appear on the ranked list of boys in ""[[The List]]"", nor did [[Bill Allen]], [[Terrance Mephesto]], [[Fosse McDonald]], or [[DogPoo Petuski]].

[[File:Pip is Killed.png|thumb|Pip is crushed to death by [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]].]]
Pip made a brief reappearance in ""[[201]]"", his second speaking appearance in eight years, where he politely asked [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]] to stop destroying the town, coming back when other townspeople ran away. She merely moved forward and stepped on him, crushing him and leaving his bloodied remains behind. His death was not addressed by the other characters. When asked if he was really dead, the [[South Park Studios]] FAQ replied, ''""He looked pretty dead to me""''. However, when asked if he had died for good in another question, it was replied with, ''""It's too early to tell now, but we'll just have to see about Pip""''.

Pip wears an old-fashioned, brown gatsby cap (nowadays known as a 'newsboy' cap), a brown bow-tie, an old-fashioned red smoking jacket, a white shirt, blue shorts, and violet knee-high socks. He has blond hair, and his body is slightly smaller than the other childrens'. After his titular episode, Pip was cleaned up slightly, with a small fringe of hair sticking out under his cap on the top left.
Pip was generally portrayed as a caring, laid-back, but awkward character, who may be constantly knocked down, but always got right back up again. The only time he ever seemed to act against this description is in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"", where the boys continually called him ''""French""'', despite the fact that he hates French people. Whenever they insulted him in this way, Pip would pick up a dodgeball and throw it at whoever was saying it, at times with inhuman strength and precision, including taking out an entire steroid-juiced Chinese dodgeball team with a single throw. He would usually apologize a moment later and revert to his old self.

Pip was not generally foul-mouthed, but he had uttered a few swear words in ""[[Pip]]"", where he used the word ''""bitch""'', and also briefly in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", where he says ''""Let's hear it for Cartman's big fat ass!""''. He was also seen singing ""[[Uncle Fucka]]"" with his classmates in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Pip was very friendly with the other students at [[South Park Elementary]], but they did not return the favor.

In the first three seasons, the main boys taunted him, saying nasty things about him and performing horrible activities with him - in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"", Stan makes him request that they hit him, claiming he would not do so, only to do so anyway, for example. However, in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", in one scene Pip and Cartman are shown seeming to get along while a bunch of other kids are talking beside.

Pip did not retaliate against the boys' bullying and abuse, except for once in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"" when he angrily threw a dodgeball at Kyle for the latter calling him ''""French""'' and spreading false stereotypes about his nationality, causing Kyle's nose to bleed. However, in the same episode, they gain brief acceptance for him after being impressed by his dodgeball skills and Kyle even offers Pip to be on the boys' team again, much to his pleasure.

Stan in particular is forced to hang out with Pip along with Butters and Dougie (whom he names them ''""Melvins""'') in ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"" while being locked in the basement at [[Mr. Mackey]]'s adult party during the Meteor Shower night. At first he is annoyed by their antics and reenactment of ''Charlie's Angels'', but once they hear the ATF was outside the house planning to shoot everyone inside on suspicions that the party attendees are part of a mass suicide cult, he collaborates with the trio and joins their game by encouraging them to hand a videotape out to the ATF containing a mock news report to confirm what is really going on inside the house. After the ATF leaves, Stan seems to have warmed up to Pip and the other two and acknowledges that he and the other kids separate them in school based on their peculiarities, but realizes they are just normal kids like him. This is quickly retracted when Kyle arrives, with Stan pointing out his night with ''""these friggin' Melvins""''.

In the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Damien]]"", Pip briefly befriended [[Damien Thorn]] and tried to sympathize with him and discourage his destruction of the school property and threat to the other students, knowing what's it's like to be an outcast, though this friendship also seemed to be one-sided. This became even more apparent when, at Cartman's birthday party, Damien and Pip crashed at the party, and Damien then set Pip on fire so that he would gain popularity amongst the other kids.

In the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Pip]]"", a spoof of the novel ''Great Expectations'', Pip befriended a boy named Pocket who later died of Hepatitis B.

Pip also had feelings for Estella, though this relationship was also one-sided until the end of the episode.

Pip seemed to have been friends with [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Dougie]], as they were seen playing together and getting along very well in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"", even collaborating to create a fake news report to videotape and show the ATF to debunk their suspicions of a suicide cult being in the house. Pip and Dougie also are seen sledding together with [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"".

However, Butters can be seen punching Pip in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", though this was part of the South Park play rehearsal where the pioneers and Indians had a rivalry, and wasn't a genuine moment of assault. Butters was also shown in the group of kids surrounding Pip on the playground and watching him get spat on by Clyde and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] in ""[[Damien]]"" and among the kids clapping after Damien set Pip on fire at Cartman's party. Butters also laughs with the others over Cartman kicking Pip in the groin in ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"". These instances can be excused as Butters had yet to be established as a character in the earliest seasons and was just an unrecognized prop.

However, their friendship from ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"" seems to have dissipated after the said episode since Butters is among the students who assures Cartman that British people don't count as an ethnicity for hate crimes after hitting Pip with a rock towards the end of ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"".

Pip can be seen talking to [[Timmy]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], and [[Kevin Stoley]] in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"".

Pip was seen at the school dance with Lizzy in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"" and they did not seem to mind each other's presence.

Despite being nice to the school children, Chef does not seem to care for Pip. In ""[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]"", when the kids are about to play football, Pip is the only one on the team without a helmet. Chef tells him that the school cannot afford helmets for everybody, so he advises him to just cope with it. Acknowledging this, Pip politely tries negotiating with him to rotate who does not get to wear a helmet each week, but Chef declines his request. Expressing no concern for his well-being, Chef advises him to bear through it and ''""get his ass""'' in the football field.

Despite his distaste for Pip, Chef showed a lot of appreciation for him after he saw how good he was at dodgeball in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"" and encouraged him to keep up the good work in order to make the South Park Cows team world champions. This did not last long, as once Pip knocks out the final team of players, Chef realizes that his obsession with dodgeball went too far and thus feels regretful for forcing the children into it. As a result, he does not bother congratulating Pip after he cheerfully exclaims that he won the game. He instead tells him to shut up as he walks out and goes home with the children.

Pip appears as an unlockable playable character in multi-player mode.

Pip appears as an unlockable playable character in the game. 

[[File:Pipreturns.png|thumb|left|Pip's brief reappearance.]]
Pip reappeared for the first time since being written out of the show. When the level ""South Park Docks"" is complete, the Japanese Video Game Voice announces ''""You have unlocked... Pip!""'' Pip then greets the boys, who immediately react with groans of anger. Pip begins to explain he knows who is behind the game's events but the kids quiet him insisting they were not hanging out with him and tell him to go away, proclaiming ''""It'll be a cold day in hell before we need help from Europeans.""'' According to his character biography, his special ability is ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady|French rage]]"", but his secret ability involves him singing ''""The Merry Tune of Stratford""'' and then running - anything he touches will take damage or die. Aside from his special ability, Pip plays identically to [[Kenny McCormick]], [[Craig Tucker]], and [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], dealing a lot of damage with snowballs and having great range but being extremely slow.

Pip's picture is seen on the ""Hall of Honor"" along with deceased faculty members (excluding [[Mr. Mackey]] and [[Ms. Claridge]], who were featured, but not deceased) and [[Gordon Stoltski]].

Pirate Ghosts,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Pirate_Ghosts,,"also referred to as '''Ghost Pirates''', are the main antagonists of the [[Season Three]] episode ""[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]"". 

Pirate Ghosts are initially seen when t[[The 6th Graders|he 5th Graders]] ''(now 6th graders)'' try to scare [[The Boys]] on the South Park Docks.

They are then seen attacking the town at the [[City Hall]] and shooting off cannons from a ghost ship and decapitating people with their swords. By the end of the episode, [[Korn]] and The Boys set up a trap to capture the Pirate Ghosts. Afterward, it is revealed that [[Father Maxi]] had set up the Pirate Ghosts to scare everyone away from the docks because he didn't want there to be a Halloween. He used a flashlight and a few cotton swabs to create the Pirate Ghosts, a cup and a piece of cheese to create the sound effects, and some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels to create the ghost ship.

The Pirate Ghosts were also part of an ongoing argument on whether they were actually called Pirate Ghosts or Ghost Pirates.

The Pirate Ghosts all wear typical pirate outfits such as peg legs and eye patches. They also wield swords and have a large ghost ship they use to shoot cannons. They all have a green color scheme and glow. Their overall design is also different from other South Park characters and is designed similar to how Korn is portrayed in the episode.

Pope John Paul II,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II,,"in Wadowice, Poland was the religious leader of the Catholic church, from 1978 until his death in 2005. He made his first appearance in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"".

Pope John Paul II made his first appearance in South Park during the episode ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"". In the episode, he receives a phone call from [[Sister Ann]] of the [[South Park Church]] after growing concerned about the messages [[Priest Maxi|Father Maxi]] is delivering to their congregation. When Father Maxi states that handicapped people like [[Timmy Burch]], who are incapable of speaking normally, will go to hell due to being unable to confess his sins, the Sister decides to ask the Pope's opinion. Unfortunately, the Pope is far too old, decrepit, and mentally vacant to answer the question and instead muttered half-phrases and blowing raspberries.

His next and final appearance was in ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"". Father Maxi, growing concerned about the shocking number of pedophile priests molesting children in the states, rushes to [[Vatican City]] in the hopes of getting the international priests to help him put a stop to it. When he arrives, however, he is shocked to learn that the entire Catholic faith believes that molesting children is acceptable, as it is not expressly forbidden in Vatican Law. When the father tries to get this changed, Pope John Paul, who is still feeble and ancient, in his own weak way declares that Vatican Law cannot be changed before asking the supreme being, ""[[Queen Spider|The Great Queen Spider]]"". In ""[[Bloody Mary]]"", when the news teller mentions ""newly elected"" Pope Benedict XVI, it means that Pope John Paul had passed away a few weeks prior.

The princess returns in ""[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]"", with the prince having a bigger role. The prince returns as well in [[Season Eighteen]] episode, ""[[Freemium Isn't Free]]"".

The prince and princess were seen performing the traditional Canadian Royal Wedding ceremony in ""[[Royal Pudding]]""; the ceremony is a parody of the British Royal Wedding. During the first part of the ceremony, the princess was abducted by an energy cube that crashed the wedding. [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], [[Scott the Dick]], and [[Ugly Bob]] go after her, only to find out that the culprit was a hideous monster known as [[Tooth Decay]]. In the end, the princess was rescued and the ceremony was resumed.

The prince gets a major role in ""[[Freemium Isn't Free]]"", where he allows the [[Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming]] to create a mobile phone app that helps pay to rebuild Canada better by making a game free and addicting. He finds out this was caused by the deeds of the Canadian Devil, in which [[Satan]] helped rescue Canada.

Princess Kenny,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Kenny,,"is the princess alter-ego of [[Kenny McCormick]]. She appears throughout [[Season Seventeen]]'s Black Friday trilogy, consisting of ""[[Black Friday]]"", ""[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]"", and ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"".

Originally, Princess Kenny was a member of the Xbox One-supporting group, under the name '''Lady McCormick''', but she betrayed them to become the leader of the PlayStation 4-supporting group because [[Eric Cartman|Grand Wizard Cartman]] would not let him be a ""princess"".

In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', she is the fair maiden at [[Kupa Keep]]. She is one of the six playable partners, and later the hidden main antagonist of the game.

In ""[[Black Friday]]"", Wizard-King Cartman sought out Lady McCormick to tell her to come to a meeting about getting cheap Xbox Ones. In the [[Garden of Betrayal]], Cartman talks to Lady McCormick about the possibility that [[Kyle Broflovski|Sir Kyle]] could betray them and tells her that her influence could be used to ""take care"" of Kyle if it became necessary to do so. However, Kenny goes on to betray Cartman, and the Xbox One supporters, by becoming the leader of the PlayStation 4-supporters, taking the title of ""Princess Kenny"".

In ""[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]"", Princess Kenny gives a narration about the coming war between the supporters of the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 and asserts that her followers would fight until she was accepted as the princess of both sides. Eventually, Cartman brings his Xbox army to Princess Kenny's backyard, asking for their surrender and insulting Kenny for wanting to play the role of princess, which Kenny refuses, calling Cartman a ""ball-licking lesbian"". Later, the [[Sony President]] comes before Princess Kenny with the [[Sony Princess Box]]. Opening the box, the Sony President gives Kenny a medallion, which turns Kenny into a Japanese princess.

In ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"", Princess Kenny receives orders at the Sony Headquarters and stops Microsoft's blockade of ships, filled with PlayStation 4s, en route to the [[South Park Mall]]. Later, Kenny is invited to a ""wedding"" at the [[Red Robin]] by Cartman, where she is told she will be accepted as the princess of both sides. After saying her goodbyes, she jumps out the window and falls hard on the ground, with blood, to the Sony workers' dismay, but she gets back up and brushes herself off. While the ""wedding"" appears peaceful at first, Sir Kyle betrays Cartman, and the covert Xbox One supporters, by joining the PlayStation 4-supporters. After [[Bill Gates]] kills the [[Sony President]] in the Red Robin, Princess Kenny, along with all the others, apathetically gets the Xbox One from [[EvGames]].

Before being titled Princess Kenny, Lady McCormick wore an unkempt blonde wig and a pink dress over Kenny's usual parka. The blonde wig is similar to the one Kenny wore in ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"" when posing as a girl. This outfit seems to be directly based on Daenerys Targaryen from ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' and its TV adaptation ''Game of Thrones'', which Princess Kenny directly parodies in the trilogy. She even wears a velvet scarf over her arms, a large gold belt, a gold necklace, pink wristbands, and some blue bead bracelets.

Princess Kenny has a styled golden-blond wig with wrapped ends and topped with a golden headdress. She wears a bejeweled white and purple dress with gold trims, gold shoulder guards, and white gloves. When she became a Nazi Zombie in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', her skin is green, and wore a Nazi wristband. Again, the entire princess outfit is worn over Kenny's usual parka; however, an unused earlier design gets rid of the parka and instead has Kenny wear makeup, and with the dress being colored orange.

After becoming a ""Japanese Princess"", Kenny takes on an ""anime"" look, complete with large, purple eyes and blush. In her anime incarnation, Kenny speaks intelligible (and mangled) Japanese, although her voice is still slightly muffled and is an obvious female impersonation. She seems to refer to herself in the third person, a trait commonly associated with ""cute"" characters in anime. She also has the power to solicit extreme admiration from (other) males simply by acting cute, a trait carried over (somewhat) to her non-anime incarnation in ''The Stick of Truth''. This version of Princess Kenny may be an exaggerated parody of the sector of the ''South Park'' fandom that often draws the characters in ""kawaii"" anime style and characterizes them as such.

Kenny's princess costume and wig are heavily based on the dress and hairstyle of various incarnations of Princess Zelda, a recurring main character from the ''Legend of Zelda'' series.

Kenny appears as a companion to the player and later reveals herself as the final antagonist of the game, betraying her friends and becoming the final boss of the game.

Kenny first appears as a member of the human army, being Cartman's right-hand man and the princess of the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]]. Despite her high rank, she is still mocked by Cartman due to Kenny's choice of being ""a chick"" and uses her as a target to test [[Douchebag]]'s new fart ability. Kenny later becomes a companion to the player and can accompany her through battles, having abilities like calling her rat friends for help (who can also kill her in the misuse of the power), exposing her ""Double D's"" to charm enemies and take their guard down, etc. She participates in many battles, including Craig's rescue mission at the school, the assault to the Inn of the Giggling Donkey, and the battle against the elves at the school. Like many other characters, she is a member of the army that assaults Clyde's fortress.

However, after the government shows up and the chief agent takes the Stick and offers it to the kids to share power with him, Princess Kenny allies herself with the agent and takes the Stick for herself, betraying her friends, who refused the Stick for friendship. Morgan Freeman explains that inside the game's fiction, Kenny is the daughter of an orc and an elf, the original holders of the [[Stick of Truth]] and that her entire orc community was slain by humans and elves, and then she had sworn revenge on them, by getting the Stick of Truth and avenging her fallen people. 

The player and his companions battle Kenny and after being defeated for the first time, Princess Kenny drinks a sample of the Nazi virus, and becomes a [[Nazi Zombies|Nazi zombie]], greatly increasing her strength and resistance. As all the companions are taken out of battle (or he avoids this and kills her enough), Douchebag is left with very little chances of defeating Kenny, so Cartman decides to break the Gentlemen's Code by having Douchebag fart on Kenny's balls. As Cartman holds Kenny, Douchebag releases a fart on Kenny's groin, defeating her and causing a flash that expands through the town and cures the Nazi Virus. If he does not fart on Kenny's balls, she will break Cartman's hold and kill him, and Douchebag will have to start the boss battle all over again.

Despite being defeated, Kenny can still be used as a companion after the end of the credits. It is implied she made up with the others and as said by Butters she was just ""PMSing"".

The following quotes are in Japanese and are from Princess Kenny's anime incarnation. She retains Kenny's usual muffled speech in her regular incarnation.

Principal Victoria,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Principal_Victoria,,"is the former principal of [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Pinkeye]]"", and was usually seen with school counselor, [[Mr. Mackey]], and shop class teacher, [[Richard Adler]]. Sometime prior to the events of [[Season Nineteen]], she was let go from South Park Elementary and replaced by [[PC Principal]]. She is currently voiced by [[April Stewart]] and was previously voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] and [[Eliza Schneider]].

Victoria was quite capable of running the school, despite the stupidity and ineptitude of the rest of the school faculty. In ""[[Go God Go]]"", she informs [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] that she knows too little about evolution to teach it and replaces her with [[Richard Dawkins]]. In early appearances, she has a heavy accent that sounds rather similar to being from Wisconsin or [[Sarah Palin]], though it seems to have diminished over the years and with the changing of voice actors.

In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", she is revealed to be a strong feminine rights activist as she tells [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] that she is a 7-year breast cancer survivor and encourages Wendy to fight for what she believes in no matter what the consequences could be for her. She shows contempt for [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and compares him directly to cancer, referring to him metaphorically as ""pure evil"", and ""a fat little lump that needs to be destroyed"". As she was the one who convinced Wendy to fight Cartman regardless of the rules, it's unlikely that she punished Wendy for fighting Cartman.

It is hinted in ""[[Toilet Paper]]"" by [[Josh Myers|Josh]] that she had an abusive mother who ""spanked her thighs with cold cuts and stuck umbrellas up her ass"". This has not been confirmed, but because he was able to correctly predict [[Officer Barbrady]]'s own abuse, this is plausible.

Despite her intelligence, she has been shown at times to be quite oblivious to things, such as in ""[[Pinkeye]]"", where she makes Cartman a ""ghost"" costume that bore a striking resemblance to a [[Ku Klux Klan]] hood.

In ""[[Stunning and Brave]]"", it was announced that she was fired from [[South Park Elementary]] due to an incident where a student referred to rape as a ""Hot Cosby"" and got replaced with [[PC Principal]]. In ""[[Sponsored Content]]"", she reveals she was replaced and the ""Hot Cosby"" was made up to get her fired. In ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", it is revealed that she got fired because of [[Mr. Mackey]].

Victoria, unlike the other residents of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], is very intelligent, competent, and rational. In fact, she is one of the few people in the entire show to be recognized as such. She is often objective to immoral or witless ideas that she is certain will end in catastrophe, and will only resort to these actions if she feels there is no other choice. She is also shown to be very motivational, such as in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"".

Despite this, Victoria has, on occasion, shown to have a dark side and be somewhat satirical to many of the characters she encounters. She was seen to have been involved in some assaults and committed second-degree murder.

Victoria wears a pink shirt, black trousers and rosy lipstick. She has large eyeglasses and curly hair in a perm style. In addition, she speaks with a thick Minnesotan accent, although as of the later seasons it has diminished.

For special occasions, as seen in the awards ceremony scene in ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"", Victoria wears an unusual outfit consisting of a lavender V-neck blouse with white lace trim around the collar, a long flared black skirt which reaches her shoes, and a pastel pink cummerbund.

In ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"", Victoria is said to have a ""nice ass"" and it is referenced many times by the male characters, even [[Herbert Garrison]].
Although she has never been a particularly major character, Principal Victoria has had a speaking appearance in every season except Season 20 and after.

Principal Victoria appears in the game as a minor character, remaining at the [[Community Center]] during the entire game.

When the Player and Chaos infiltrate the Freedom Pal's lair, Doctor Timothy informs the team that he cannot 'rape' Chaos' mind because of his tinfoil helmet, and as a result cannot find out if Chaos' intentions are true. Nobody bothers to remove the helmet, as presumably this would be cheating.

At the end of the game, Chaos turns up at the Player's house and mockingly points out that ""no matter what, your dad will always have fucked your mom"", clearly having returned to his chaotic ways. He suggests you ""let your darker side free"", and the game ends on his evil chuckle...

Whenever Chaos dies with Mysterion still in battle, Mysterion will comment that he ""died doing what was right"".

After several episodes as [[the boys]]' fourth friend following [[Kenny Dies|the ""permanent"" death of Kenny]], Butters was fired by the others for being ""too lame"" and being unable to fill Kenny's niche. Fed up with such poor treatment by his classmates, he turns to a life of evil and builds his costume. Professor Chaos begins to attempt a reign of terror by switching Bennigan's menus, stealing erasers, among other minor crimes, and becomes increasingly frustrated with a lack of recognition from the town, blaming it on a government cover-up. His identity is soon figured out by another boy, who turns out to be Dougie, who joins him as General Disarray, due to their status as outcasts. He shows technical skill by hacking into a large screen at a baseball game where he announces his plans to flood the Earth, which again fails. His final plan is to use aerosol cans to deplete the ozone layer. This plan also fails.

Professor Chaos becomes even more disillusioned with his plans when Dougie points out they all seem to be ripped off from the show ""The Simpsons"" and even when he comes up with good, original plans, the show uses them (including the one about replacing the chocolates in the cherries). He nearly suffers a mental breakdown, seeing everyone in the town as their Simpsons counterparts until the boys, [[Chef]] and [[Mr. Garrison]] finally help him realize all the ideas the Simpsons have already done are just carbon copies of ideas from other television programs. They also go on to point out that every idea has already been done in some way or another. With a new perspective, Butters returns to his plans of devastating the world.

During this short arc, [[Diane Choksondik]] is killed, but her last surviving appearance is chasing off Professor Chaos.

[[File:GTWWR21.png|thumb|A hovering Anime Styled Chaos as featured in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"".]]
He is seen confronted as a primary antagonist against the boys in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", where he is initially mistaken as Craig when Cartman asks, ""Craig, is that you?"" He is later revealed to be Butters after being hit with Kenny's shuriken. After getting struck by a shuriken, the boys try to hide him from their parents to no avail, even dressing him up as a dog and putting him in a shelter, but in the end, Butters' condition is ignored when Cartman's penis is shown in front of the entire town.

In the 'Superheroes Arc', Professor Chaos does not display any electromagnetic superpowers as a villain like he did ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", although they were just imaginary, and is defeated by [[Mysterion]] when Chaos and General Disarray fought him near the end of the episode. Cartman, as [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]], seeks Chaos's assistance in order to figure out the identity of Mysterion. He then allies with Professor Chaos and bullies Chaos into threatening to blow up a hospital if Mysterion does not reveal his identity. When the Coon leaves, Mysterion confronts Chaos, and Disarray flees. Disarray soon rejoins the fight and flees again in their brawl against Mysterion. Then, the Coon comes to finish off Chaos by slashing him, thus making Chaos run away home. He later encourages Mysterion to reveal his identity otherwise crime can ensue.

In the later episodes of the Superheroes Arc, Chaos is only seen inside a holding cell at the [[Coon and Friends]] Headquarters as a punishment for his misdeeds, though it is not seen what his deeds were. At the end of ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", The Coon is also in the same cell as Chaos after Cthulhu was defeated by Mint Berry Crunch.

After finally getting sick of his abusive Grandma, Butters becomes Chaos to try and stop her from bullying him, but she had adopted her own evil alter ego and easily overpowered Chaos with the threat of Gummy Bears.

Professor Chaos creates fake Facebook posts about the [[Coon and Friends]], ruining their reputation and keeping them from getting Netflix to greenlight their superhero franchise. He later hires a group of children to act as his minions, the Chaos Kids, and write even more fake posts about them. Butters then works with [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who aids him in his plan, allowing all fake posts to surface, as the public blindly accepts each post as 'news'. However, Professor Chaos is thwarted when the [[Coon and Friends]] simultaneously clear their names, defeat Zuckerberg, and force him to shut down Facebook entirely.

A key to Professor Chaos's Lair and costume can be found at Butters' house. The lair is located at the storage facility where the player can befriend [[Dougie|General Disarray]], get several items, a Chinpokomon, and roof access. The Lair is set to activate numerous electrical items on arrival, with the claim that this will burn out all power in the world. If Paladin Butters is the player's companion, Paladin Butters will pass several compliments regarding the mysterious Professor Chaos.

Paladin Butters' 3rd ability is ""Professor Chaos"" which has Butters turn into the anime style Professor Chaos, the player then spins a wheel to choose a random powerful ability. These abilities are:
The Coon and Friends suspect that Professor Chaos is responsible for the missing cats and the troubles around town. While pursuing Professor Chaos, the New Kid learns the Sandblaster technique from Stan to blow away obstacles like Lava Lego. Both Freedom Pals and Coon and Friends buy into the roleplay that Professor Chaos is dangerous and untrustworthy. They then learn that Professor Chaos was paid $20,000 by a [[Mitch Conner|mysterious figure]], to put an end to both the [[Coon and Friends]] and the [[Freedom Pals]], and is using the money to hire Mexicans as his Minions and dress them in tinfoil as a boss. The Coon Friends and Freedom Pals must work together to stop him from spreading Lava Lego over the entire town, or nobody will be able to step outside ever again!

After his defeat and capture, The Coon is fine with working with Professor Chaos to infiltrate the Freedom Pals, although the others do not trust him. Professor Chaos teaches the Player his '''Haywire''' Buddy Ability, and also requests the Player's aid in getting back his money in a spin-the-wheel mini-game at the bank, which is how the Player can find their income bracket and will gain Chaos' third attack.

When the Player and Chaos infiltrate the Freedom Pal's lair, Doctor Timothy informs the team that he cannot 'rape' Chaos' mind because of his tinfoil helmet, and as a result cannot find out if Chaos' intentions are true. Nobody bothers to remove the helmet, as presumably this would be cheating.

At the end of the game, Chaos turns up at the Player's house and mockingly points out that ""no matter what, your dad will always have fucked your mom"", clearly having returned to his chaotic ways. He suggests you ""let your darker side free"", and the game ends on his evil chuckle...

Whenever Chaos dies with Mysterion still in battle, Mysterion will comment that he ""died doing what was right"".

Professor Chaos specializes in attack and disruption from a distance. His Chaos Blast is similar to Human Kite's eye lasers, while his Chaos Confuse-O-Tron works best against enemies in the thick of their own formation, where they can catch their allies with Shock and target them via Confuse; if nothing else, its long range lets him hit foes from a wide variety of angles. His Chaos Minion is an effective meat shield, being able to move around and inflict damage to draw enemy fire. His Ultimate ability is a powerful weapon against clusters of foes.

Professor Chaos is a strong buddy on higher difficulties, where Shock does more damage and turning enemies against each other with Confuse can become even more useful.

His field ability is '''Haywire''', which allows the New Kid to fart a ""Winged Minion"" (a hamster with a tiny helmet and glider) at exposed wiring to deactivate certain devices.

The boys quickly suspect Professor Chaos as behind the attacks on the town and confront him in the ""Butters' House"" level, but after a brief discussion of his evil plan, he admits his real plan was far less devious and that he was not actually behind the attacks. Villains arrive and battle the five boys, but by the end, Chaos shatters a testicle, and is taken to [[Hells Pass Hospital]], the site of the next level, and afterwards is absent from the storyline.

He can be unlocked as a playable character if one has one of several unique special codes which were released with [[South Park: The Complete Thirteenth Season]] or are awarded online if you are very skilled at the game. His move set is the ""Sniper""-type used by [[Kenny McCormick]], [[Craig Tucker]], and [[Pip Pirrip]], with slow movement but heavy damage. His special ability is akin to that of [[Eric Cartman]], reigning chaos and causing heavy damage to enemies all over the screen.

[[File:ProfessorChaos120.png|thumb|right|Professor Chaos with his sidekick General Disarray]]
Professor Chaos wears tinfoil gloves, helmet, boots, and a green cape. His helmet has a red dot on the forehead. His helmet has no top, showing Butter's blonde hair. He has aluminum shoulder pads, connected by a chain that goes across his chest, shoulder to shoulder.

In ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"", his appearance changes, such as becoming a muscular adult, his blonde hair becomes a blonde Mohawk, and boots change to feet wrapped in bandages, mimicking Muay Thai fighters who wear on bandages their feet. Professor Chaos mentions that his green cape is weaved with titanium. His eyes show no iris or pupils, like those of various anime characters in the episode, such as Bullrog's (Cartman) or Craig's.

Professor Chaos seems to be a mad-scientist-like villain whose goal is to bring chaos and disorder. In his debut episode, he was able to hack the Jumbotron screen at the stadium to announce that he is going to flood the world. This is the only exceptional act he has done as his immense powers in ""Good Times with Weapons"" are his imagination. He seems to be frustrated in ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"" because every plan he came up with had already been done by the Simpsons but got over it after Chef and Garrison concluded that ideas have always been done by another, hence passed down.

His superpowers are only featured in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"". When donning on his costume, he turns into a large muscular man, surrounded with an electromagnetic aura. When introducing himself to the boys, he is able to hover above the ground and discharge bolts of lighting around him. His titanium cape is able to shield himself from special abilities cast by the boys. He is able to jump up in the air and land on the ground causing a miniature earthquake. He is able to instantly cast a web, thus trapping people such as Stan and Kyle in the ""Web of Holding"". After Kenny's shuriken cuts Chaos's eye, Professor Chaos reverts into Butters. In the Superheroes Arc, there is no indication of the superpowers he had in ""Good Times with Weapons""

Lamont demonstrated this by forcing [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to hold a loaded .38 revolver in his mouth. Butters held this position for the remainder of the day, as he was seen in the class well into the evening.

During his lecture, he is interrupted by two individuals, who informs him about cats doing a meme themselves, which involved posting pictures of themselves on the internet with bread around their heads. [[Mr. Kitty]] is guilty of doing such meme.

While on the run from the Catholic Church and [[Bill Donohue]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], along with the bunny [[Snowball]], visit Professor Teabag, an expert on the history of Easter. Professor Teabag tells them he is busy at the moment, but when Stan mentions the [[Hare Club for Men]], he welcomes them in to tell them the story. Professor Teabag shows them a picture of the Last Supper. He brings their attention to something that looks like an egg, lying in front of St. Peter, the first pope. He then tells them that St. Peter was no man, but a rabbit. To this, Kyle responds, ""Peter Rabbit?""

He goes on more to say the Church would not let Leonardo da Vinci paint St. Peter as a Rabbit, so he was forced to paint him as a man. He did though leave clues as to the true identity of St. Peter, such as the egg. With laser technology, they were able to look past the second layer of paint, to the original depiction of St. Peter as a Rabbit. When Stan question why [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] would want a rabbit to run his church, Professor Teabag tells him Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men are intolerant and corrupted, but Rabbit's are pure. The Catholic church covered it up though, and put a man in charge. The Hare Club for Men has been painting Easter Eggs ever since to keep the truth alive.

He saved the boys at a price of his own life when ninjas stormed his manor and killed his Butler. He put a box of Peeps in his microwave and they expand rapidly filling the whole manor, killing the Professor and the Ninjas.

He eventually joins Tom Cruise and John Travolta in the closet and sings with them. When he leaves with them at the episode's conclusion, he looks timid and scared, implying they sexually abused him. He is later seen at the MTV Music Awards in ""[[Britney's New Look]]"".

R. Kelly has a thick black beard, as well as black eyebrows that are very close to eyes. He wears a creme suit, creme pants, a white v-neck, and an earring on his right ear.

R. Kelly seems to obsessively sing every word he says. He carries around a small pistol, which he has no problems using to intimidate others into getting what he wants. His personality in the episode is a homage to his exaggerated personality in his musical video series also called ''Trapped in the Closet''.

",['Butters Stotch']
Rachel,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Rachel,,"was a representative for Quality Curtains who made her only appearance in the [[Season Nine]] episode ""[[Marjorine]]"".

When [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] returns to his house after faking his own death, his parents, [[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] and [[Linda Stotch|Linda]] believe he is a demon spawn and keeps him chained up in their basement. When Butters tells his parents that he is hungry, they call up Rachel from Quality Curtains to install curtains in their basement. When Rachel sees Butters chained up in the basement, Stephen bashes her over the head with a shovel and gives Butters her corpse to feed on.

It is unknown if she was killed or knocked unconscious, though it is likely she died from her injuries later. 

Rachel had long brown hair and brown eyebrows. She wore a magenta vest with an orange undershirt, a black skirt, and black shoes. She also wore pink lipstick.

Radiohead,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Radiohead,,"is an English rock band that appears in the [[Season Five]] episode, ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"".

In ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", the band is touched by [[Eric Cartman]]'s letter, and goes to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] to comfort [[Scott Tenorman]]. However, after seeing him cry, they insult him and leave, unaware of the fact that Scott is actually grieving over the deaths of his parents.

Matt Stone drove up to Santa Barbara to record Radiohead after a concert of theirs. This is confirmed in commentary minis with [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]].

They all wear clothing of varying appearance, however their basic outfit is the same: pants, a shirt or coat, and an undershirt, however, two members of the band (Thom Yorke and Phil Selway) do not wear a shirt or coat. 
They seem to be caring, leaving their work just to visit [[Scott Tenorman]], due to a letter [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] sent that claimed he had ""ass cancer"". However, this is later revoked when they see Scott crying. This led to them insulting him and leaving calling him a ""little cry baby"", unaware that he is extremely upset over his parents' deaths.

Raila Odinga,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Raila_Odinga,,"was the Prime Minister of Kenya, serving from April 17, 2008 to April 9, 2013. He appears in ""[[Pinewood Derby]]"" as one of the world leaders.

He has receding black hair, thin black eyebrows, and a black mustache. He wears a dark green suit, red tie, and white undershirt.

Due to the events of ""[[Pinewood Derby]]"", we can assume he is somewhat self-centered, agreeing to keep the ""space cash"" as well as agreeing to nuke [[Finland]] when they threatened to tell the ""space cops"" about the ""space cash"".

She is first seen in ""[[Jewpacabra]]"" as part of the city's Bigfoot Researchers. She later appeared in the episodes ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"" and ""[[Christmas Snow]]"", but without a significant role.

Ranae Holland is seen wearing a light blue hat with dark blue accents and black glasses and wears a red shirt under a pale pink coat, black trousers, and shiny brown boots. She was shown with brown hair and brown eyebrows.

In ""[[Christmas Snow]]"", she is seen wearing a pink cap and a dark blue coat.

Rancid,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Rancid,,"is a punk rock group from Berkeley, California. They were one of the bands featured in the [[Season Two]] episode, ""[[Chef Aid]]"", as well as on the soundtrack ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]''.

The song featured on the show and on the album, called ""[[Brad Logan]]"", is about a friend named Brad Logan who has been in many bands and toured as a 'roadie' on many occasions for Rancid. This song is not available on any of Rancid's regular releases.

The band makes a guest appearance on ""[[Chef Aid]]"" performing the song. They also appear in the mockumentary, [[Chef Aid: Behind the Menu]].

The band appears as typical punk rock band with t-shits, denim jean pants, and spiky hair.
They are very altruistic, as shown when they play for free to raise money for [[Chef]] in ""[[Chef Aid]]"".

Randy Marsh,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Randy_Marsh,,"is the son of [[Marvin Marsh|Marvin]] and [[Grandma Marsh]], the husband of [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]], and the father of [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Shelley Marsh|Shelley]]. He makes his debut in the [[Season One]] episode ""[[Volcano]]"" and is voiced by [[Trey Parker]].

Despite being a geologist with a doctorate, he is generally portrayed as an absent-minded idiot, driving many episode plots in the later seasons, though this was later revealed to be due to him being unhappy over his marriage. However, in earlier seasons he was calmer and more level-headed, often providing advice to the boys. In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", he divorced his wife and moved away. However, in ""[[Ass Burgers]]"" he reconciled with Sharon and remarried, therefore getting their old house back. In [[Season Twenty-Two]], Randy founded the [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] hemp farming business, before returning to his geologist job in ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars Part 2]]''.

Randy is named after and based upon [[Trey Parker]]'s father, Randy Parker, who is also a geologist.

In ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"", he kills Glen because he was starting to act like a homeless person, and in ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"", he kills a fellow security guard for wanting to get out of duty during Black Friday. In ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"" he floods a theater killing and drowning [[Larry Feegan]], although he did this inadvertently. In ""[[Band in China]]"", he strangles [[Winnie the Pooh]] to death in order to appease the Chinese government so he can expand his cannabis business on an international scale.
*'''Drunk Driving:''' In ""[[Bloody Mary]]"", he drives drunk which causes him to be arrested, and as a result has his driver's license revoked. Randy has had his keys taken away from him on multiple occasions to keep him from driving drunk.
*'''Arson:''' In ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"", he burns down 2 stores: Wall-Mart and Jim's Drugs. In ""[[Mexican Joker]]"", he bombs numerous home-grown cannabis crops in the backyards of people's homes, causing death and destruction.
*'''Cheesing:''' In ""[[Major Boobage]]"", it is implied that he had been cheesing as he knew of the side effects.
*'''Indecent Exposure:''' In ""[[Cock Magic]]"", he performs tricks with his penis in front of kindergarteners. 
*'''Domestic Terrorism:''' In ""[[Mexican Joker]]"", Randy conspires with two representatives from a billion-dollar cannabis company to get rid of home-grown cannabis, and bombs numerous people's crops in their backyards, killing many in the process so he and his co-conspirers can corner the market on cannabis.
*'''Unlicensed Slaughter:''' In ""[[Let Them Eat Goo]]"", after selling his own ""plant-based"" burgers (cannabis edibles) to boost business, Randy and Towelie are manipulated into killing many cows by The Goo Man (under the assumption that a ranch farmer is simply filling Randy's farm with ""useless"" cows, as Randy promoted veganism and plant-based foods, making beef obsolete when The Goo Man actually paid him to help sabotage Randy's business). Since these are cows, this can be seen as common slaughter, but as Randy did not have a proper slaughterhouse set up this can be seen as unlicensed slaughter. While this is illegal, Randy only did this due to the fact that the cows were polluting his farm with their waste, eating his crops, and preventing him from harvesting his crops.
*'''Sale/Distribution of Recreational Marijuana; Violation of the Controlled Substances Act:''' Ever since ""[[Tegridy Farms]]"", Randy has started a business which involves selling and distributing recreational marijuana to others. While this is technically legal in the state of Colorado, it is still a federal crime, and it violates the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
*'''Sale, Production and Distribution of Contaminated/Illicit Substances:''' In ""[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]"", while promoting his new cannabis strain the ""Halloween Special"".. Randy sells cannabis that was contaminated by his daughter Shelley. The cannabis contained a hazardous chemical concoction of furniture polisher, paint thinner, bleach, ammonia, and antifreeze. He initially was going to discard it but after seeing that the concoction enhanced the cannabis, Randy decided to sell it as planned, but without examining it to see if what was safe for usage. The contaminated cannabis was shown to have caused Randy and Towelie to have nightmarish hallucinations and was heavily implied by Mayor McDaniels to have ""poisoned"" people causing serious harm to everybody. While Shelley is at fault for contaminating the product, Randy is also accountable as he witnessed Shelley contaminate his product and decided to sell it anyway. In ""[[Christmas Snow]]"", when Santa has the sale and purchase of alcohol banned during the holidays in an effort to decrease the town's amount of drunk driving, the townspeople go to Randy for cannabis to use to help give them some ""holiday spirit"". As it was winter and his crops were dead Randy was left with the decision of selling old strains or combining them to make a new strain. Since this was not good enough by Randy's standards, he decides to combine strains and then visibly lace them with cocaine. When initially asked what the white substance was, he said it is ""Just a little something extra, for a special kick"". Later when Mayor McDaniels confronted him on what the white substance was, Randy confirmed it was in fact cocaine, and that Randy did not even know cocaine was illegal to begin with and that he could not just sell it to people without them knowing. Immediately after, Randy started protests to legalize cocaine for medicinal and recreational usage, succeeding in making cocaine legal in seven U.S. states including Colorado. While cocaine distribution became legal after this, whatever cocaine Randy had sold and distributed beforehand was both illegal and immoral. Even after Randy had cocaine legalized, there was massive collateral damage done to the town due to cocaine intoxication.
*'''Bestiality:''' In ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"", it is revealed Randy had sex with a bat and a pangolin while he was in China, together with [[Mickey Mouse]]. However, this was because he was drunk with Mickey and thus intoxicated into having sex with the bat and pangolin.

Randy Marsh is shown to be an actual liberal. He often fights for huge changes and only turns to conservatism when he is in a major problem, goes into an obsession stance, or misunderstands something. His liberalism is first seen in ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", when he tells the people of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] that they have to fart all the time in order to avoid being burned alive. He was also shown to support the people of the future in ""[[Goobacks]]"", and thinks of them just as normal people. He even grounds Stan for calling these people Goobacks in a fast food restaurant, but his grounding was lifted after Randy loses his job to one of those people from the future. In ""[[About Last Night...]]"" Randy's political views are confirmed after he is seen supporting [[Barack Obama|Obama]]. In ""[[Member Berries]]"", he strongly supported [[Hillary Clinton]]'s run for presidency but made it clear this was an unusual occurrence and was only supporting her because of his dislike of [[Herbert Garrison]], although he is briefly enticed by Garrison's run in ""[[The Damned]]"".

As first seen in ""[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]"", Randy has a very unhealthy addiction to masturbation. He often masturbates without thinking straight and becomes obsessive on whatever he is masturbating on. In ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", he was watching [[Mrs. Tenorman]] take her bra off. Later, in ""[[Over Logging]]"", he sneaks in the room where the internet is hidden then goes on it and starts looking at unusual pornographic material. In ""[[Crème Fraiche]]"", he was beating it to cooking shows. This soon became an obsession and it forced Sharon to give Randy an ""old fashioned"" in order to end his obsession and save their marriage.

[[File:BloodyMary (44).png|thumb|Randy and his ""disease"" of alcoholism]]
In ""[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]"", ""[[Clubhouses]]"", and ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", it was hinted that Randy has a drinking problem. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] also mentioned it in ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", at one point stating, ""''Looks like Stan's dad's been hitting the bottle again.''"" His problem was more closely examined in ""[[Bloody Mary]]"" after he was pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving. He got a DUI and his driver's license was suspended. The judge made him go around schools including [[South Park Elementary]] to explain to kids why heavy drinking is bad and sentenced him to 2 weeks of [[Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)|Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. As a result of the A.A meetings, Randy misunderstands the concept of alcoholism and believes that only spirituality can cure him of this.

He has been depicted as everything from a casual drinker to a heavy alcoholic. He still is not as bad as [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s father, [[Stuart McCormick]], as, unlike the latter, he is sober most of the time. He also had a job until he got himself fired in ""[[About Last Night...]]"" for a drunken tirade directed toward his boss. (It was revealed, though, that he was re-hired as a geologist in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]""). It appears Randy Marsh is a binge drinker - one who stays most of the time sober but drinks heavily at suitable instances. He might have a family history of alcoholism because his son Stan was seen getting drunk in order to avoid his cynicism in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"".

He was shown to still have a drinking problem in ""[[Freemium Isn't Free]]"" and ""[[Stunning and Brave]]"" although he denied this in both cases.

[[File:TesticularCancer-Randy.transparent.png|thumb|left]]
Randy has an unhealthy attraction to marijuana, going as far as to intentionally giving himself cancer just so he could get his hands on legal marijuana. He tried many ways to get cancer, such as smoking, getting a tan, and attaching cell phones to his face. He eventually came up with the idea of sticking his testicles in a microwave, as seen in ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"", just to get weed. Ten other men, including [[Jimbo]] and [[Ned]], soon follow Randy's example.

Despite being drawn to marijuana in the aforementioned episode, he seems to display some level of contempt for it in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"", as not only do he and Sharon hire someone to scare Stan from drugs, he also is the one to defame marijuana at the end as he points out that the worst thing about pot is that one could be doing something better with their life instead of smoking it.

Ultimately, Randy purchases a hemp farm in [[Season Twenty-Two]] and gives up geology to begin his own marijuana business, [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]].

It appears Randy Marsh is very musically talented, and occasionally the show states that he once had dreams of being a famous musician. He is a good singer, and he can play guitar really well as seen in ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"" and ""[[Over Logging]]"". He also sang and played the guitar in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", but this was not a display of good talent.

In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", it's revealed that Randy was part of a boy band in the 1980s called ""[[The Ghetto Avenue Boys]]"". His group was successful for a few years, but he and the other members were quickly replaced due to getting ""too old.""

Randy began performing again in ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", presumably out of a midlife crisis but quit because it was causing trouble in his marriage. He performed ""tween wave"" in [[Mick's Bowling]] under the stage name Steamy Ray Vaughn.

As shown in ""[[The Cissy]]"", he eventually achieved success as [[Lorde]], although in this case, it was due to his voice being changed with computers although it was implied in ""[[Handicar]]"" that he also plays guitar in Lorde's music. He eventually ended his music career in ""[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]"", after an embarrassing live performance at The [[Pepsi Center]] and becoming disillusioned with the music industry and their use of holograms.

It is also implied in ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"", that Randy and his wife, Sharon used to be [[Hippies]], and they met at Woodstock in 1969. If this was the case, though, they would be in their mid-forties to mid-fifties. However, this may have been simply a cutaway joke. Also, Randy and Sharon were revealed to have met in a tree-fort playing Truth or Dare, in ""[[Clubhouses]]"".

Randy tells the other adults in town, at the end of ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", that he studied [[Mongolians|Mongolian]] in college, possibly minoring in the subject. He then speaks it to the children, who have joined a tribe of Mongolians. However, it appears that he does not apply his knowledge of the language to his life, as this is the only time he is heard speaking it. He may also have a Ph.D. in Geology as he has been called Dr. Marsh on two separate occasions (although one of those times was himself).

In ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", Randy makes a [[World of Warcraft]] account (which is named Falcorn and is a level 2 human hunter, which is not possible in the actual game at the time of the episode's creation) after seeing his son Stan play it.

In ""[[Pinewood Derby]]"" he makes Stan cheat in his derby race, accidentally discovers warp drive, and consequently becomes the first contact for aliens coming to Earth. He and the leaders of the world keep trying to cover their lies. He grounded Stan for telling the truth, however, he and the others lied to the aliens. As punishment for failing that test so badly, Earth and the Moon are permanently enclosed in a gigantic, cubical force field and isolated from the rest of the Universe — to which Randy says, ""Well, that sucks.""

Randy has driven red sedans, Lexus RX300s, and Lincoln Navigators. In ""[[Smug Alert!]]"", he is seen driving a Honda Civic Hybrid.

Randy is currently a hemp farmer. He has had numerous other occupations throughout the series, the most notable one being a geologist.

[[File:SomethingYouCanDoWithYourFinger065.png|thumb|Randy in his band.]]
In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", Randy reveals to Stan that he was in a boy band when he was eighteen, after having been in a choir during high school. He was so eager about this new career, that he dropped out of school, left his girlfriend and his family, and immediately joined a boy band. The name of his band was The Ghetto Avenue Boys, which is meant to be a parody of The Backstreet Boys. They had a hit single, ""''You Got It''"", and they made millions, living in a big mansion with dozens of women sharing his bed with him at once. But one year later, all of the group members were fired for being too old for a boy band, despite the fact that Randy was only nineteen at the time. Randy was in debt to the studio, and in order to make up for it, he had to give up all of his possessions. He then returned home at last and used up what money he had left resuming his education.

An interesting thing to note is that Randy is shown to be very proficient at the guitar in ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"". He also mentions in that episode that he knows how to play several famous rock songs on the guitar, such as ""[[Carry On Wayward Son]]"" by Kerry Livgren.

[[File:SpontaneousCombustion020.png|thumb|Randy as a scientist.]]
Ever since his first appearance, he has been shown to be a geologist. In later seasons, notably in the [[Season Eight]] episode ""[[Goobacks]]"", he is known to be a worker for the United States Geological Survey. He became famous for his theory on moderation in ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"" and won the Nobel Prize Award for it. He is often called upon to perform many scientific tasks, due to his education and positions. He usually is unable to perform the tasks despite the fact he is a geologist and thus has a high level of understanding of many areas of science, including chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics. However, his skills in geology might not be that good as well, as in ""[[Volcano]]"" he had to call someone to figure out why the ""needle thing"" was moving and what it meant when the mountain was smoking, and even after discovering it was a volcanic eruption, he casually finishes his coffee first.
He lost his job in ""[[About Last Night...]]"" for verbally and physically abusing his boss and then punching him because he thought he did not need his job now that Obama was president. Randy was eventually re-hired, as first seen in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"" when he tells Stan that he saw his new [[Facebook]] page while at the office.

He may hold a Ph.D. in geology as he has been referred to as Dr. Marsh on two occasions: once by a Republican Senator in ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"" and once by himself in ""[[T.M.I.]]"" while he was teaching children about penis measurement. The [[Rebecca Turnod|Surgeon General]] rebuked his complicated formula for measuring a penis; she does not consider him to be qualified enough, which is hardly surprising as his doctorate is in Geology, not human sexuality.

In the [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode ""[[Tegridy Farms]]"", he moves his family to [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] and starts a new weed business, presumably quitting his geologist job. He would later come to his terms on his behavior exhibited prior to ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars Part 2]]'' and temporarily returns to his profession to help resolve the drought in Colorado, constructing a [[Government Desalinization Plant|desalination plant]] that extracts water from human breast implants. In this episode, we learn that he's a graduate of the [[University of the Mountains]].

In ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"", Randy worked at the [[Wall-Mart]] in [[South Park]] until [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] saved him from being killed as the store was destroyed in the end.

[[File:CremeFraiche19.png|thumb|right|Randy as a celebrity school chef in the cafeteria.]]
Randy becomes obsessed with cooking after seeing the [[Food Network]] in ""[[Crème Fraiche]]"". He loves it so much, that he becomes the boys' new cafeteria chef, and also quotes [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]]'s greeting to the boys. He creates his own show, called ""[[Cafeteria Fraiche]] "". Other celebrities of the Food Network then challenge him to a cook-off. However, he used this position mostly just to show off his cooking skills rather than serving meals to the students.

[[File:YoureGettingOld047.png|thumb|Randy Marsh as ""Steamy Ray Vaughn"".]]
In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", Randy impulses his career as a solo singer of a popular musical genre called ""Tween Wave"" naming himself as ""Steamy Ray Vaughn"".

In ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"" Randy begins to write, compose, and direct a musical play originally titled ''Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen''. After making having a bro down and making amends with the [[Broadway Bros]], they agree to help Randy with the musical and re-title it as [[The Woman in White]]. It is unknown if the musical was ever completed.

[[File:Sarcastaball014.png|thumb|right|Randy as the school's sarcastaball coach.]]
Randy ironically invents the sport of [[Sarcastaball (Sport)|sarcastaball]] in the aptly named ""[[Sarcastaball]]"", but no one realizes he is being sarcastic, and the school makes him the coach of [[South Park Elementary]]'s sarcastaball team. Eventually, the NFL is officially replaced with a sarcastaball league and Randy becomes the coach of the [[Denver Broncos]] until he drinks [[Butters Stotch|Butters']] cum, causing him to make his first genuine comment in a long while and curing him of his sarcasm disorder.

In ""[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]"" Randy purchases [[Blockbuster]] for $10,000. The dialogue suggests he may have owned what was left of the entire business. Randy is driven to madness due to the lack of customers and everyone telling him that renting is outdated. After Shelley burns down the store, the Marsh family gets some of their money back from insurance and Randy goes back to his job as a geologist.

[[File:SongofAssandFire00014.png|thumb|right|Randy as the mall's head of security.]]
In [[Season Seventeen|Season Seventeen's]] ""[[Black Friday]]"" trilogy, Randy takes a second job as a security officer at the mall. He tells everyone it's to earn some extra holiday cash, but in truth he wants to be inside the mall on Black Friday before everyone else so he can shop on great deals before things get too hectic. After the former chief of security is killed by an out-of-control parent anticipating the new [[Stop Touching Me Elmo|Elmo]] doll, he is promoted to succeed him. Randy becomes upset when all the security guards he grew to like to keep dying.

In ""[[Gluten Free Ebola]]"", Randy performs at the end party as Lorde. This is carried on to the next episode, ""[[The Cissy]]"" where he is revealed to have a double life as Lorde and is secretly hiding cash he earns for writing the songs inside the walls of their house. He wrote the song ""Hunger Games (Ya-Ya-Ya)"" and ""[[Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday)]]"".

In ""[[REHASH|#REHASH]]"", Lorde performed at The Women of Rock concert at the [[Pepsi Center]] where he embarrassed his daughter with the lewd performance.

In ""[[HappyHolograms]]"" Randy helps defeat the Record Producer's hologram performers at the ''[[Washington Redskins: Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special]]''.

In ""[[Cock Magic]]"", Randy shows the boys his own interpretation of Cock Magic, which involves him doing magic tricks with his penis. Later, he performs at a kindergartner's birthday party, with horrible results. Even later in the episode, Randy performs yet again at [[Panda Express]].

After moving his family to the [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] in the [[Tegridy Farms|eponymous episode]] of the [[Season Twenty-Two]], Randy becomes a hemp farmer, starting a new weed business. In the season finale ""[[Bike Parade]]"", Sharon tells Randy that the hemp farm was a bad business idea because people barely buy from him, but Randy manages to get a lot of customers during the Amazon strike, expanding his business with the help of [[Towelie (Character)|Towelie]].

Randy has an extremely addictive personality and has more unhealthy obsessions than any other adult in South Park (although this is also partly because he is one of the most prominent adults in the show). Sharon tries to dissuade him but tends to fail.
[[File:Volcano024.png|thumb|left|Randy's first appearance in ""[[Volcano]]"".]]
Randy wears a white shirt under a blue-cyan jacket with two pockets on each side and the sleeves up, he also wears black pants and black shoes. His left-side pocket usually has a yellow, a red, and a blue pen with a pocket protector. As of ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"", Randy has been given a slightly more detailed redesign, such as the pencil and pens in his chest pocket changing colors and no longer being depicted as simple lines.

He has thick, black hair with parted bangs, and a thick black mustache, both of which seem to evoke a 1970s hairstyle. In early episodes, though, his hairstyle was somewhat different (see left). Up until ""[[Chickenlover]]"", he did not have a dimpled chin and the white shirt under the jacket. But in and after that episode he mysteriously developed one (of course, in the early stages of [[South Park]], many things changed).

At bedtime, Randy wears deep blue pajamas with a long-sleeved shirt and gray slippers. Though he appears slim and in shape when clothed, he is rather flabby, and has a protruding stomach, as seen when naked. Randy also has prosthetic testicles following the removal of his own due to his self-induced testicular cancer as seen in [[Season Fourteen]]'s ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"".

In his special occasion outfit, which consists of a white dress shirt, a light blue tuxedo, blue pants, and a gold tie, he has a gold handkerchief in his blue coat pocket. In later seasons it changed to a brown tuxedo, white dress shirt, grey pants, and a red tie.

As of ""[[Tegridy Farms]]"", Randy now wears a straw hat, a blue plaid shirt underneath a brown hooded jacket, a black belt with a gold buckle, filthy greenish-gray pants, and muddy brown shoes.

In ""[[Christmas Snow]]"" he had a gray beard and was wearing a red coat with white buttons and black suspenders.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Randy is now an elderly man with grey hair, which is balding at the top. He reverts back to his attire preceding ""[[Tegridy Farms]]"", with the only differecnes being that he wears a light brown coat over his blue shirt and instead of black shoes, he sports a pair of brown sandals with grey socks underneath.

[[File:Randydrunkdriving.jpg|thumb|left|Randy gets caught drinking and driving]]
Randy is often portrayed as an intelligent but simultaneously dim-witted, quick to think, naive man, while all the same a caring, doting father. However, he is also obsessive and when he gets engrossed in something, his personality turns to the exact opposite. He becomes immature, childish, and dumb during the obsession phases. He has a habit of being led astray by new fads or events, like many of the characters. All the same, he has also been known to go completely against such things, though his reasons are usually selfish and immature. He will also try to do a heroic thing but will then be distracted due to a selfish reason as seen in ""[[Insheeption]]"". However, this was caused by [[Mr. Mackey]] because Randy ignored the psychiatrist's wanting about Mackey's dream being so unstable. Another aspect and common trait of Randy is that he will often take up a cause, but they hypocritically abandon that cause or objective whenever he sees it as something that will damage his reputation or finds something else that will be beneficial for himself or his family. Such instances of this are in ""[[Margaritaville]]"", when he led the townspeople to abandon all material possessions and economic activities in order to ""please the economy"", but when Kyle decided to pay for everyone's debt, he was one of the people in line who chose to have his debt paid for, immediately abandoning his previous beliefs. Another instance is in ""[[Naughty Ninjas]]"", when he sought out Officer Barbrady to shoot kids who they thought were part of ISIS. But when he found out that they were just playing ninjas and Officer Barbrady accidentally shot [[David]], he immediately blamed Officer Barbrady, along with the Mayor and her staff. When Officer Barbrady reminded Randy that he'd told him ""to shoot some kids"", Randy insists that he was saying it as a question and tries to shift all the blame from him and target the very person he'd sought out for help.

Randy also seems to drink a lot of coffee, shown carrying a cup in most episodes he is in at one point or another.

Randy has a tendency to act very melodramatically. Whenever things get surreal in the show, and Randy is calling for his son, he usually puts on an act of being very ill and weak, and moaning Stan's name out: ""''Staaaaaan!''"". Randy is also shown to be a hypochondriac, as revealed by Stan in ""[[Bloody Mary]]"".

In ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"", ""[[Future Stan]]"" reveals that Randy does not like chicken. He also does not like cherry pop-tarts, as he expressed disgust when [[Linda Stotch]] pointed out that those were the only ones left in ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"".

In ""[[Guitar Queer-O]]"", Randy can be seen strumming a guitar with his right hand; he may, therefore, be right-handed.

He is obsessive with a few things, as evidenced with his video camera in ""[[Pandemic]]"" when he videotaped his father [[Marvin Marsh]] in the bathtub, Sharon, Stan and Shelley eating dinner (which is implied to have happened multiple times), a [[Peruvian Pan Flute Music|Peruvian flute band]] outside the house (asking Stan to go outside next to them), Sharon and Shelley watching CNN, Sharon talking to the Broflovskis and Tuckers about their missing boys, Sharon calling someone to help with the missing boys and the [[Furry Death|gargantuan guinea pigs rampaging through town]]. Sharon frequently reprimanded him for doing this, calling him an idiot at one point.

Randy is shown to be very violent at times. He often is in mobs and flips over [[Korn]]'s truck. He chops off a [[Future Stan|man's]] hand, and perhaps kills him, in order to stop Stan from knowing that he was a fake in ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"". He is shown in the end of ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"" fighting with [[Skeeter]]. He is shown to be very violent again in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", beating up rival baseball dads. He shoots off a man's head when he fears the man is becoming homeless when homeless people take over the town. He beats up a woman in ""[[T.M.I.]]"" after she questions his theory about penis sizes, implying that Randy is hostile to anyone who accuses him of having a small dick (which also explains [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] personality). He also gets sent to anger management and then takes over a FedEx building with Cartman, [[Tuong Lu Kim]], [[Goth Kids|Michael]], and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]. He also joins the civil war re-enactors with Cartman and loots, rapes, and tortures.

In ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"", he was armed with a shotgun, while hiding with other parents on top of the community center. While he did not use his weapon against the surrounding homeless, he did decapitate [[Glen]] as punishment for being homeless.

In ""[[Band in China]]"", he kills Winnie The Pooh, in order to sell his weed in China.

[[File:InformativeMurderPorn072.png|thumb|left|Randy with his wife, Sharon.]]
She is Randy's wife. They married as Randy was dressed as Christopher Columbus, instead of an ordinary groom, much to her dislike. She seems to be more sensible than him at the best of times, although they both are known to be very hotheaded on occasion. In ""[[Clubhouses]]"", they were constantly bickering, and ultimately, they divorce. Randy then became an incompetent father who spent the whole time partying the nights away, and never seemed to have time for his children. At the end of the episode, Sharon decided she still loved Randy, and they had sex in Stan's tree fort. They then presumably remarried. Up until this episode, they had been inseparable from each other; afterward, they are still loving, but their relationship is a bit more complicated. In more recent seasons, Sharon has become more annoyed with Randy's over-the-top and childish behavior, such as the events of ""[[Pandemic]]"", where she freaks out and attacks him when he spends all his time playing with a video camera while the family's lives are in danger. Even worse, this turned out to be pointless, as he had forgotten to put film in the camera. In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", they divorced due to his actions. Sharon and Randy both confess to faking their happiness in their relationship. However, after communicating, they've become more aware of each other's feelings, and they reconcile in ""[[Ass Burgers]]"" and remarry.

[[File:Stan-marsh-0.png|thumb|left|Randy's son, Stan]]
Stan is Randy's son, and youngest child. Randy loves his son very much and goes out of his way to either protect or save him, as shown in episodes ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"", ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"" and ""[[Pee]]"". Stan, however, gets very annoyed and frustrated by Randy's reckless and embarrassing behavior, and usually only takes his advice because he feels obliged to do so.

In ""[[About Last Night...]]"", Stan got so irritated by the street party outside which was being led in large part by his father, that he made a noise complaint. All he could say when they tipped [[Officer Barbrady]]'s car over was, ""''Jesus Christ!''"" and continued to watch in annoyed horror as his father's action became steadily worse. Things in-fact became even worse when Randy refused to help with [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s younger brother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], who had fallen out of the window and Randy ended up getting fired from his job for acting like a drunk-idiot towards his boss. Also, it may be noted that Stan did not want his parents to move back together in ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", this may be also taken as a sign that he does not like his father's behavior. In ""[[Sarcastaball]]"" Stan said Randy exaggerates every disease he gets. However, Stan sometimes thanks Randy when the latter helps him, such as saying to him ""You're the greatest"" in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"" when Randy got him disqualified from Baseball, despite looking down on his behavior beforehand.

Randy will also publicly vocally express his annoyance in certain incidences in which Stan was a part of most of the time being incredibly harsh in situations that do not call for it.

[[File:Shelly.png|thumb|Randy's daughter, [[Shelley Marsh|Shelley]].]]
Shelley is Randy's daughter, and elder child. She is very violent to her younger brother, Stan, although she is very nice or at least indifferent whenever her parents are around. Because of this, Randy and Sharon have remained completely oblivious to her abusive nature. and when Stan told them what she did, they did not believe him. Shelley, however, like Stan and Sharon often gets annoyed with her father's behavior, rolling her eyes but rarely saying anything other than, ""Mom, what's up Dad's ass?""

In ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"", Randy drove all the way to the musical to prevent Shelley from giving a blowjob to [[Larry Feegan]].

Shelley does not feel like he loves her, claiming that he does not even try to get to know her in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"". Randy responds saying that he really wants to, but he feels like she hates him. Their relationship deteriorates quite a bit once the family moves to Tegridy Farms, as Shelley has a ""marijuana problem"".

He is Randy's ancient father, who is 102 years old. He is suicidal, though everyone merely laughs at his requests to be killed, saying, ""''That's our silly Grampa!''"" In ""[[Grey Dawn]]"", he was frustrated by the way Randy spoke to him as if he were speaking to his son, rather than his father. Stan then explained that that was partly why Grampa waged the war between the young and the elderly because he did not want to be ""treated like he was 12"". In ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"" it is revealed that Marvin brought Randy to the [[Hare Club for Men]] when he was little. In ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"", Marvin claims to have never wanted children and that Randy was ""supposed to be nothing but the dried-up crust on Gram Gram's titties""; this possible resentment may partly explain the strain on their relationship.

[[File:Grandma Marsh.jpg|thumb|Randy's mother, [[Grandma Marsh]].]]
She is Randy's mother. She was once married to [[Marvin Marsh]]. However, due to the fact that they do not live together, and Marvin had a sexual encounter with a contortionist in ""[[Quintuplets 2000]]"", this would imply that she also left Marvin eventually. She is currently suffering from an unknown illness in the hospital. She frequents Facebook, and often calls Randy to bully [[Stan Marsh]] into keeping up with her Facebook status as seen in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"".

Jimbo is Randy's brother-in-law. They appear to have a decent friendly relationship, often drinking together and talking about normal guy stuff.

Although its canonicity is disputed, Randy Marsh plays a major role in the video game as an assistant to the player in the ""Mountain Pass"" level where [[Volcano|his geology station is among the locations under attack]], informing the boys to look out for the threat of [[ManBearPig]] while noting humorously he is ""''gonna have a beer!''"" He reappears at the level's end to let the player know [[Timmy Burch]] is correct that they must next visit Downtown. He is not a playable character.

Randy plays a role in the plot as the most prominent adult in the game, up to the point where [[The New Kid]] is abducted by [[Visitors|aliens]], in which they meet him on the ship. He tells them that this is the price they pay for living in a small mountain town and gives them assistance in escaping the ship. The player has to play a rhythm-based mini-game to help get the probing machine out of Randy's ass.

After being rescued from the probing machine, Randy can be found at the [[Community Center]], when they want to place the Goth Kid's notice on the table. He is a member of the community council where he teaches players the Sneaky Squeaker fart, which can be used to distract guards. To get a photo, the New Kid hands over a USB stick with information, but the council does not listen to the whole thing and so does not know the real reason the military is in South Park.

Later on in the game, they meet him at the [[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic]], disguised as a woman and trying to find out why the military is interested in the medical records of the women of South Park. The player must prove they are a doctor by giving him an abortion, the first step involves painfully numbing his balls, despite the fact that Randy's balls are [[Medicinal Fried Chicken|prosthetic]]. After completion of the area, he returns to the community center until players are in the final area of the game, stating that the government had planted a snuke in [[Mr. Slave|Mr. Slave's]] rectum and the only way to get it out is with somebody who can both shrink in size and perform abortions.

The abortion performed on the Snuke is identical to the abortion performed on Randy.

Randy plays a lesser role in the plot compared to the first game, but still helps set the scene for how South Park is seriously going downhill.

[[The New Kid]] first meets Randy on their first day buffing out scratches on his car. He tells the New Kid he'll follow them if they find out who's been keying his car and leaving nasty notes, as he is concerned it's a jilted lover. 

On their first night in the mission ""[[The Bowels of the Beast]]"", with [[Captain Diabetes]] by their side, the New Kid learns it's a beer-drunk Randy keying his own car and insulting Sharon, who is telling him to stop from the window. They refuse to allow him to drive drunk, and he fights them, shouting lines like ""I thought this was America!"" - a line which fans will recognise Randy has shouted multiple times on the show when becoming inebriated and violent.

Later, drunk on red wine, he smashes into the back room of the Italian Restaurant, saving the New Kid from the Italians, but still drunkenly demanding his keys, and getting into another fight when once again New Kid and Captain Diabetes refuse to hand the keys over. The line '""Red wine drunk is the worst kind of drunk"" is used by the Italians. 

The player can from the second day find Randy in the Community Center as they did in the previous game and get him as a Follower.

He shows up on the inauguration day of the new mayor and is starting a speech before he is interrupted.

Randy Newman is seen in-person deep under the ocean by [[James Cameron]], who tries to ""raise The Bar"". He wishes to keep [[The Bar]] low because ""People won't hire him"". After James Cameron finds Randy Newman in the ocean, he says he will, ""Send him to Hell!"".

Randy's Friends,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Randy%27s_Friends,,"are a group of four local men that appear in [[Season Three]] episode ""[[Spontaneous Combustion]]"", dressed up as [[the boys]].

Randy was tasked by [[Mayor McDaniels]] to investigate the cause of spontaneous combustion among the townspeople. As part of his experiment on the case of [[Kenny McCormick]], he requested four men to dress up as the boys and walk around the lab, but did not manage to retrieve any findings. The men started to complain about Randy breaking his promise to go drink beer with them and watch sports. As a result, the man dressed up as Cartman decided to leave, behaving similarly to his counterpart.

The men are dressed up as the boys. Some notable differences are the different hair colors for the men dressing up as [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], a mustache for the man dressing up as Kyle, as well as a full beard for the man dressing up as Cartman.

Ranger McFriendly,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_McFriendly,,"is a park ranger who appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode, ""[[Smug Alert!]]"". 

After [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s [[Hey People, You Gotta Drive Hybrids Already|song]] causes everyone to drive hybrids and be smug about it, the toxic gas ""smug"" covers [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], causing McFriendly to angrily hit Stan and show him the effects of driving hybrids. After informing the [[townsfolk]] of the smug, he forces Stan to destroy all the hybrids by himself, just in time for the smug storm to have the least impact on the town.

He wears the standard park ranger's uniform: tan hat, beige button-up shirt, and taupe pants. He also has a badge near his left shoulder, as well as a utility belt on his waist.
He is rather mean-spirited and aggressive, contrary to his name, although his attitude was justified considering the danger Stan unintentionally put South Park in. Although, it is debatable if punching Stan was also justified, or further confirming his spitefulness. He is also very forceful and threatening, making Stan destroy all the hybrid cars by himself despite his small stature, and age.

Ranger Pete,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_Pete,,"was a forest ranger who appears in [[Season Fourteen]] episode ""[[Insheeption]]"", speaking to the young [[Mr. Mackey]]'s class the day they went on a field trip to [[Frisco Woods]]. He introduced them to [[Woodsy Owl]], not suspecting that Woodsy was a child molester, and paired Mackey up with [[Billy Thompson]] and his friends, unknowingly setting in motion the events leading to the young Mackey's molestation by Woodsy Owl.

He wears the standard forest ranger uniform: a light brown hat, a light brown shirt with several metals and patches, and brown pants. He also wears a belt with keys attached to it.
He seems to love the forest, which fits in perfectly with his job. He may also be slightly unintelligent, failing to see the young [[Mr. Mackey]]'s fear when [[Billy Thompson]] wants to be in Mackey's group.

Rauf Xerxes,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Rauf_Xerxes,,"is the owner of [[Club Persh]] in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. She tried to shut down the [[Les Bos]] bar but was stopped by [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]]. She appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, ""[[D-Yikes!]]"".

Xerxes wears a nearly half-unbuttoned, spotted white shirt, and blue jeans. She also wears several items of jewelry. Her right ear, nose, and right eyebrow are pierced. She also has been seen wearing a Bluetooth headset on her left ear. Despite attempting to masquerade as a man, she seems to have very ""worked on"" eyebrows.

Xerxes has a compromise-type personality, originally willing to reason with the girls who were preventing them from taking over [[Les Bos]]. She also seems to have a lust for power, even going as far as masquerading as a man so she could become the leader of South Park's Persian club.

In ""[[D-Yikes!]]"", she is seen scissoring with Mrs. Garrison, with this, we can presume that they may have had a short relationship (Although, it could've just been a one-night stand). Mrs. Garrison has since ""changed back"" into a man, and since Xerxes is a lesbian, we can assume that their relationship is over.

Rebecca (Raisins Girl),https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca_(Raisins_Girl),,"is a [[Raisins Girls|Raisins girl]] who appeared in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.

In ""[[Medicinal Fried Fiasco]]"" mission, as [[The New Kid]] enters the [[Main Street]] alley, they are surrounded by several other Raisins Girls. When the New Kid defeats the girls, Rebecca was called upon to fight the New Kid, delivering a body slam. However, Rebecca immediately discovered that she received a thousand dislikes on an Instagram photo of her in ballet class (and therefore losing all her followers), leaving the alley in a hurry and in panic.

She can be fought again in the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins restaurant]] as part of ""[[A Perky Predicament]]"" mission.

Rebecca is the only overweight girl among all other Raisins Girl. She wears the Raisins uniform with an undersized shirt which exposes her belly. She has brown pigtail hair.

Rebecca,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca_(Towelie%27s_Girlfriend),,"is [[Towelie (Character)|Towelie]]'s girlfriend and [[Washcloth]]'s mother. She appears in the Season ""[[Crippled Summer]]"".

[[File:Washcloth.png|thumb|left|Rebecca's boyfriend, [[Towelie (Character)|Towelie]], and her son, [[Washcloth]].]]
She and Towelie have a son named ""Washcloth"". She and Towelie apparently never married, however in the episode ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", it says that she was his ex-wife, not his ex-girlfriend. Unfortunately, they did not remain together long due to Towelie's relapsing drug addiction and she kicked him out believing he would be a bad influence on their son. Because of this, she would not let him talk to their son when he was high. After Towelie goes to rehab and is clean, he moves back in with Rebecca and their son.

Even though she was mentioned many times, she only appeared in one picture, giving birth to Washcloth. Her face is censored due to it being on the intervention and wanted to keep her anonymous.

Rebecca Cotswolds,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca_Cotswolds,,"is a home-schooled girl who first appeared in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"", where she took part in alongside her [[Mark Cotswolds|brother]] and won the 15th Annual [[South Park Spelling Bee]].

Rebecca and her [[Mark Cotswolds|brother]] lived in a very sheltered, home-schooled life with their parents and with very little exposure to the outside world. They were both seen as intelligent but lacking in social skills, and until the spelling bee had not seen the outside town or interacted with other children their age. While Mark wanted to go to a [[South Park Elementary|public school]] after meeting the other children, Rebecca had no interest in the outside world and chosen to stay at home. She was noticeably twitchy and anxious.

[[Kyle Broflovski]] developed a crush on Rebecca at the spelling bee and began to pursue her, though she was oblivious to his advances. Kyle had sung about her and she responded to this by throwing some change at him. The two had eventually talked and played with each other, and Rebecca was finally becoming curious about the outside world. After learning about love, and being kissed by Kyle, she agreed to go with him to the [[Bay of Pigs Memorial Dance|school dance]].

However, after having been sheltered for so long, Rebecca instantly became over-enthusiastic and began dressing and acting in a promiscuous manner as a whore. At the dance, she was seen hitting on [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], and [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]], much to her brother's and Kyle's horror. 

Mark retaliated for Kyle turning his sister into a slut, and proceeded to beat him up. Impressed, the other boys began to fight on who gets to hang out with Mark. Their father attempted to intervene, but Mark convinced him that it would be better to face these social situations now, versus in the future. He then allows them both to go to public school.

Unlike her brother, who made occasional cameo appearances for the next several seasons, Rebecca has yet to reappear on the show sometime and has presumably returned to home-schooling.

Rebecca wears a lime green coat with a deep magenta collar and yellow trousers. Her hair is rather curly and is held back at each side by two round, red barrettes parting her bangs.

When she first appeared in the episode, her coat's collar briefly changed to a white one with two red ribbons dangling from it, due to an animation error. Her hair was depicted as being dark brown in those frames as well.

As a slut, she wore a green-and-black spotted bra top, an ankle-length, black-and-silver skirt, fishnet socks, and a pair of black stiletto pumps. Her hair was feathered and teased out to a large, wild style, and wears a large amount of makeup.

She has a slightly smaller model than a typical fourth grader, as seen when interacting with Kyle.

Though she is intelligent and studious as well, Rebecca is naive and sheltered from the ways of the world and rather introverted. Her awkward behavior and reclusive personality stem from her lack of social life.

She tends to stammer a lot, her voice almost constantly quiver and shake in a flat tone, and seems to shy away from eye contact. One of her major quirks is her tapping and clasping of her hands together, and when spelling, she opens them to whisper the letters of a word into them before she says them out loud. Typically when she is not speaking, she is biting her lower lip. She also tends to shake much like [[Tweek Tweak]] but not as severe.

She had no idea what love was, or even how to kiss, considering the idea and the outside world is ""silly"". The only concept of ""love"" she had was that of a ""mate"", and her provider would select one for her when it would come time to ""increase the herd"". After experiencing what a kiss was, she considered her newfound loose behavior as ""having fun"", unaware of what proper love was, having been denied knowledge of it for so long.

Rebecca was also oblivious to the double meaning of her ""surgeon"" game, her parents fearing that she was getting sexual with Kyle. In reality, she was pretending to be a doctor and was using him as a brain surgery patient.

Though Kyle had a crush on Rebecca not long after meeting her, she remained clueless about his interaction. He attempted to serenade her with a [[Rebecca's Song|song]], but she did not understand its purpose, and when he first tried to talk to her, she took him up to her bedroom enthusiastically and played a realistic game of 'doctor' with him. When he tried to ask her out to the dance directly, she insisted obliviously that her father would drive her there. After a heart-to-heart about love, she seemed confused but agreed to try doing a 'kiss' with him, with that she enjoyed enough to try kissing other boys later. It is unclear if she reciprocated any feelings for him, but she kissed him again when all the chaos was over at the dance.

On the night before the concert, she picks up a musical score that was edited by [[the boys]] (having added [[The Brown Note]] to take revenge on the [[New York Kids]]), thinking that the revision was done by [[Yoko Ono]]. She then instructs the concert crew to reprint and distribute the updated scores to all participants. This eventually led to a defecation incident worldwide when the participants play the brown note.

Red McArthur,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Red_McArthur,,"and '''Rebecca''', is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth-grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She is, arguably, the third-most prominent female character in the fourth grade, behind [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. She sits at the front of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s class, usually to the far left. Red is one of ""the popular girls"" in the fourth grade. She is almost always shown with the other popular girls like [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]], [[Annie Knitts|Annie]], [[Nelly]], [[Jenny Simons|Jenny]], [[Lola]], and others.

In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", an episode of [[Season Six|season six]], she was given a prominent speaking role, saying more than a word or two than her speaking debut in ""[[Damien]]"". In this episode, [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] brought up that she couldn't stand Bebe anymore. The girls begin talking nastily about [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. Red then says: ""You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute."" After this she didn't speak until [[Season Eight|season eight]] in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"" where she says two words. Later in season eight, in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"" she spoke even more sufficiently. After this season, primarily ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Playset"", Red was considered as a secondary character. In [[Season Nine|season nine]] she played an important role in ""[[Marjorine]]"" where she was one of the girls at [[Heidi Turner]]'s sleepover. In ""[[Erection Day]]"" she speaks again to [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]. Her role has been gradually increasing since this. Before, people used to recognize her simply as the red-haired girl who was seen in the background of many episodes.

She went twenty-three seasons of being known only as ""Red"" despite being in the show since [[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe|the start]]. Her full name was revealed in ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"".

In ""[[Erection Day]]"", she slaps [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] in response to the latter's request to have sex with her. Although, it was done out of self-defense, but since Jimmy is handicapped it could still be considered a crime against the disabled.
*'''Civil unrest/rioting:''' In ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"", Red is one of the many kids rioting at the Nebraska mall. She is a participant of the South Park Elementary gender war in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"".

*'''Graft:''' She, along with numerous other girls on the South Park Girls' List Committee, altered the list of cutest boys so that Clyde would be on the top, in order to get free shoes from him. This is graft, because Red abused her authority for personal gain.

Red's hair is a mirrored version of [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s, although it is red and slightly shorter. She is also very similar to [[Sally Turner]]; they both have similar color schemes and have similar voices. In the earlier seasons, she wore a purple jacket with dark blue pants. In the later seasons, she wears a navy blue jacket with buttons and mauve trimming at the top instead, mauve gloves, and navy blue pants (which are the colors of Wendy Testaburger's jacket reversed).

In ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", she was shown to be wearing a violet jacket (similar to Wendy Testaburger's) with tan trimming and matching mittens while on the bus with [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]].

In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", when she was dressed as a ""stupid spoiled whore"", Red wore a violet bolero jacket with brown fur trim, an orange string bikini top, a denim miniskirt, fishnet stockings, and teal boots with trimmed fur. She also had pink blush on her face, teal eyeshadow, pink lipstick, and her hair were very glossy. During the whore-off scene, she wore a pair of violet gloves mainly because the outside was cold.

When dressed for the sleepover in ""[[Marjorine]]"" she wore a golden-yellow, green button-down top with a blue and white striped lace collar and pajama pants.

Red has played a modest role as a part of Wendy's gang. She has been portrayed as the more confrontational of the girls at times, as demonstrated when she called [[Marjorine (Character)|Marjorine]] a geek and said: ""she'd live alone for the rest of her life"" at [[Heidi Turner]]'s [[Marjorine|sleepover]], and when she warned Wendy about [[The List|the corrupted list of the cutest boys at South Park Elementary]].

Red can also be benevolent at times; in some episodes she has been kind to many people and engaging in friendly conversations, for example, in ""[[Erection Day]]"" she kindly greets [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] when he comes to talk to her, but when she hears him say that he wants to have sex with her she becomes very disgusted with him and slaps him. Also, she hasn't been afraid to stand up for others: in ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"", Red and Lola rush to Butters' defense after the four boys criticize him for taking the credit for writing the title book.

A trait of courage was shown in ""[[Marjorine]]"" when the girls did ""Light as a feather, stiff as a board"", when Red volunteered to go first. This is a very spiritual activity and when Marjorine (Butters) saw them doing this he screamed and accused them of being witches.

She has also been shown to like to party, like in ""[[Marjorine]]"" where she was shown dancing to the new [[Justin Timberlake]] CD with her friends after they gave Marjorine ([[Butters Stotch|Butters]]) a make-over. She was also shown in ""[[Douche and Turd]]"" and ""[[The Hobbit]]"" that she was on the school cheerleading squad along with some other girls.

[[File:Spgirls.png|left|thumb|Wendy, Lola, and Red, being approached by [[Stan Marsh|Stan]].]]

Red has been shown to be one of the very popular girls in the grade; she may even be more popular than Wendy or Bebe. In many different episodes, she has been shown in the background with many different girls. In the older episodes, she was shown in almost every episode, being followed by boys, which could be suggesting that she is also very pretty and attractive. Also when [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] became aware that he was the cutest boy in the class in ""[[The List]]"", the first person he asked out was Red. In ""[[Erection Day]]"", when [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] found out he had to have sex with someone to stop having his erection problems, the first person he went to was Red. In ""[[Sarcastaball]]"", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] has a dream about Red and Wendy kissing him in an ice cream parlor; in said dream, as Wendy shows affection towards him, Red jealously says ""Leave him alone, Wendy. He's mine!"" and the two then proceed to kiss him, causing Butters to wake up and ejaculate, another sign of Red's popularity with boys. Also in ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] paid all of the girls to go crazy for their music video, he chose Red and Bebe to hug and rub him over all of the other girls, there-again, showing that Red is one of the cutest girls in the grade.

Red has also expressed jealousy, anger, and sadness. In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", she is shown gossiping about Bebe with Wendy and the other girls. In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", she is seen as disheartened and insecure, saying ""I'd give anything to be with [[Bridon Gueermo]], but he'd never go out with me. I'm nobody.""

In ""[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]"", Red is shown in the [[Cheesy Poofs]] commercial that [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] was supposed to be in. During the episode, Cartman was bragging to the third-grade class (which they were in at the time) about how he won the competition and how he was going to be in the Cheesy Poofs commercial. Everyone was jealous of Cartman but Red must have been selected to be in the commercial by the company. She was actually shown more in the commercial than Cartman was.

In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", at Bebe's party, she held [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] down and tried to kiss him. This was most likely because all the girls were acting like whores during the episode. Aside from the aforementioned instance, they have not interacted one-on-one. However, in ""[[Butterballs]]"", after Stan voiced his dissatisfaction over bullying, Red congratulated him, saying ""at least someone in this school has some balls.""

In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", she had a crush on [[Bridon Gueermo]], as did the rest of [[List of Female 4th Graders|the girls]], and says that she would give anything to be with Bridon, after [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] brings up that she saw him at the movies seeing ''High School Musical 3''. But then she points out that he would never go for her because she is, in her words, nobody. [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] tells her that it's not true and then breaks into song.

In ""[[The List]]"", it was revealed that Red was dating Clyde, but this was only because of the girls' plot to get free shoes from him. So we can not say that she actually ""liked"" him, especially because on the real list that one fan calculated, [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] was listed number thirteen, meaning that he was one of the bottom five cutest guys in the class.

It appeared in ""[[Erection Day]]"" that Red may have had a bit of a liking for Jimmy when he approached her, she seemed really friendly and a bit shy, however, this turned right around after [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] asked her immediately to have sex with her. She then slapped him, called him a jerk, and walked away disgusted with him.

Red's first interaction with Butters in ""[[Marjorine]]"" was a rather unpleasant one, as previously discussed; however, she was quick to defend him against the boys in ""[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]"", telling them not to pick on Butters because he was, as she put it, ""a very fragile artist."" Their relationship however, is currently unknown, as the two haven't recently interacted. However, due to the gender war that separated the boys and girls in school throughout [[Season Twenty]], she can be heard shouting ""All boys should die!"" in the crowd of Butters and [[Nelly]]'s fight in ""[[Douche and a Danish]]"", implying her disapproval of said gender war that Butters started by forming the ""Wieners Out"" movement.

Craig and Red are paired together in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"". Like the other children, they seem to greatly enjoy one another's company during the project. Craig and Red are also seen together throughout ""[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]"", are in the children's choir together in ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", and sit next to each other on the bus in ""[[Basic Cable]]"".

Red and [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] have appeared together in the background from early on, though it's become more common to see them together in the more recent seasons, implying that the two may have a close friendship like that of [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]'s but Red has also been shown being followed by many boys and girls, showing that she is very popular and has many good friends. And still, of all these appearances, she has been shown with [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] the most.

In the earlier seasons, Red was often shown in the background with [[Kevin]], usually hanging out or at lunch. The two were even shown to be trading sandwiches in ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"". They also appeared together at Cartman's party in ""[[Damien]]"" and held hands while singing ""[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]"". They were seen at the movies together watching ''[[Asses of Fire]]'' in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

In addition, Kevin is seen looking sad at the dance in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"" right near Red, who is dancing with [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], implying that he might have wanted to dance with her instead. They are also seen sitting next to each other on the bus in ""[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]"", chatting before class starts in ""[[Gnomes]]"", and playing instruments in a band together in ""[[Summer Sucks]]"". Red is also shown as one of the girls hitting on Kevin as he walks by in the hallway in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"".

Around the fourth season, the lunch room's design began changing as the main boys were more often seen with other children, and the two were no longer regularly shown together. In addition, newer episodes such as ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"" and ""[[Fatbeard]]"", portray Kevin as a geek with an obsession of ''Star Wars'', and Red is shown to be one of the popular girls in the school. As Red's role in the series has gradually increased, Kevin's has remained the same save for a major role in ""[[Fatbeard]]"".

[[File:SkankHunt00037.png|thumb|Red breaking up with Kevin in ""[[Skank Hunt]]""]]
The two had not been shown together with a few exceptions, such as ""[[Lice Capades]]"", in class in ""[[Fatbeard]]"" and arguably ""[[Super Fun Time]]"".

It was revealed in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"" that they were in a relationship prior to their breakup. Kevin is devastated by their abrupt breakup and he can be seen weeping in the hallway while looking at Red's note at the end of the episode.

Tolkien and Red attended the dance together in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"". Like most of her relationships however, this one is unknown, as she hasn't recently interacted with him.

Brimmy and Red can be seen talking to each other in the background of ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"" and ""[[Ginger Kids]]"". In both episodes, they seem to enjoy each other's company, which implies that they are at least friends, though she hasn't recently interacted with him.

Red plays no role in the storyline of ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and is one of the 'additional characters' unlocked at the game's completion. She is the same class as [[Eric Cartman]], [[Wendy Testaburger]], and [[Tolkien Black]], moving slowly but dealing heavy damage. Her unique special ability has her yell out ""Sunshine!"" and causes damage to all enemies within a small radius. She also has a fast charge rate.

Red plays a minor role in this game; the player helps her, Wendy, and Bebe find out who amongst them is a ""two-faced bitch"" in order to recruit the girls for the final battle. The player then goes on to the next mission to pose as Bebe's boyfriend, before posing as a girl to enter the abortion clinic. After successfully completing the quest and recruiting the girls, Red adds the player as a Facebook friend, dubs him an ""honorary girl"", and asks him if he wants to do some shopping.

Throughout days 1 and 2, including the mission [[Operation: Just 'Cause]], Red can be seen playing cards with Nichole and a selfie can be taken with her. After Day 2, she becomes unavailable as she is nowhere to be found in South Park.

Ricardo Montalban,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Ricardo_Montalban,,"was an American actor. He appeared as his ''Fantasy Island'' character, Mr. Roarke, in the [[Season Seven]] episode, ""[[Cancelled]]"", as one of [[Najix]]'s forms. Montalban's character Khan from the TV show ''Star Trek'' and the film ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' appeared in the [[Imaginationland]] trilogy. He also appeared among the dead celebrities in ""[[Dead Celebrities]]"".

He is also referenced via [[a 34-Year-Old Asian Man Who Looks Strikingly Similar to Ricardo Montalbán]] in ""[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]"".

Ricardo has several facial wrinkles as well as an abnormally large nose. 
In ""[[Cancelled]]"" he appeared in a white suit and black tie. 
In ""[[Imaginationland]]"", he appeared in a brown shirt with most of his chest exposed, carrying a bloody sword.
The Ricardo in ""[[Cancelled]]"" and the Ricardo in ""[[Imaginationland]]"" were likely two different people, the one in ""[[Cancelled]]"" being one of [[Najix]]'s forms, and the one in ""[[Imaginationland]]"" being one of Ricardo's characters, Khan from ''Star Trek''. They will be listed under separate headers to prevent any confusion.
The Ricardo shown here was one of [[Najix|the alien]] forms, portraying his ''Fantasy Island'' character Mr. Roarke, with his assistant Tattoo ([[Hervé Villechaize]]) also being with him.
He was one of the evil characters of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]], so, we can assume that he, along with the rest of the evil imaginary characters wanted to take over Imaginationland.

Richard Adler,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Adler,,"is the shop class teacher at the [[South Park Elementary]]. He first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"". 

He often admonishes students to stop ""screwing around"" for various reasons, and plays small supporting or background roles in scenes where school faculty are needed.

Mr. Adler is first introduced in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"" when the boys take shop class. He asks which of the kids in class is a troublemaker, which prompts the boys to argue whether it is [[Tweek Tweak]] or [[Craig Tucker]]. Throughout the episode, he is played by recurring memories of his deceased [[Mr. Adler's Girlfriend|fiancée]], which culminates in a vision of her death, followed by the consumption of nicotine gum. He is dating [[Pearl]], the home economics teacher, but has trouble moving on from his deceased fiancee. He plans to commit suicide after running out of his supply of gum, and after writing his suicide note, Adler planned to commit suicide by laying on a log cutter. However, he is interrupted by a fight between Tweek and Craig, who enter his classroom through the window, killing [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] in the process. After having a vision including his fiancée, his grandmother, and his uncle, he is finally able to move on.

He returns in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", where he speaks at a meeting to agree with [[Diane Choksondik]] that the teachers have a responsibility to keep the school children, including [[Kindergartners]] safe if they will ""screw around"" anyway.

In ""[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]"", he is present as the adults discuss the confusion over the September 11th terrorist attacks, to which he agrees with [[Skeeter]] that it was a conspiracy and asks if others are aware there were explosions seen at the base of the towers.

He voted for [[Barack Obama]] in ""[[About Last Night...]]"" and wore a grey sweater with Obama's face as well, expressing optimism that everything would be awesome.

In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"" he appeared alongside [[Mr. Mackey]] as one of the commentators at the basketball game. 

In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", it is revealed that Adler is a member of the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] when the boys recognize him attending one of the cult meetings at Jim McElroy's House. He can also be seen in a photograph being arrested as a member of the cult ten years prior to the series alongside [[Stuart McCormick]] and [[Carol McCormick|his wife]].

He played a prominent role with the [[Principal Victoria]] and Mackey in ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"" as they tried to avoid another student suicide and work with [[Eric Cartman]] to prevent him from teasing the victims of Eavesdropper, leading to them throwing him under a bus.

In ""[[Butterballs]]"", he is confused when he finds [[Butters Stotch]] and [[Grandma Stotch|his grandmother]] in a school bathroom that isn't supposed to be locked, before offering to help her find the correct girls' bathroom, laughing off her excuse that Butters had allegedly showed her to the wrong room.

He is shown sitting at a bar with [[Herbert Garrison]] and [[Jimbo Kern]] when Garrison expresses concern about political correctness and immigration in ""[[Where My Country Gone?]]"", leading to Garrison's presidential campaign, though he is not seen attending any campaign events.

In ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", he is one of the adults trying to get the [[COVID-19 Vaccine]] at [[Walgreens]], seen at the beginning with [[Mr. Mackey]].

Adler is overweight with balding brown hair and has sagging, overly large cheeks. He wears a white long-sleeved shirt, under a green vest, and beige pants. His vest has a diamond-shaped, green and black pattern on it. He also has a band-aid on his head from an unknown injury which he has in all of his appearances.

When he ten years younger, he looked similarly, with slightly more hair behind his ears, darker, no bandaid on his head, and a similar sweater but a deeper shade of blue and a slightly different pattern. This design is occasionally used incorrectly in the background of present-day appearances.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he wears a white short-sleeved shirt, while retaining the green vest. The diamond patterns on his vest has lined up to form a continuous horizontal band. His nose has slightly reddened.

Mr. Adler seems to generally be a relaxed person who is not particularly outspoken. When something makes him feel anxious or guilty, he appears easily overwhelmed, taking a while to move past his fiancee's death and becoming suicidal when he runs out of nicotine gum to deal with it.

He claims to have a low tolerance for troublemakers, asking students to identify themselves or classmates as such, and often expresses concern that students are ""screwing around"", referring to causing trouble, fighting, not paying attention, or on one occasion, sex itself.

Mr. Adler attends a PTA meeting at the [[Community Center]] alongside the other teachers, all of whom are willing to befriend [[The New Kid]] when he proves that an attack on the town is imminent. After this mission is complete, he is available for Facebook. He can only be found in the community center during the game.

Adler appears in [[South Park Elementary]], where the New Kid can take a selfie with him if they do not ""screw around"". If they take too long taking the photograph or shake the camera, he may reject the selfie for ""screwing around"".

Richard Dawkins,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Dawkins,,"is a well respected English scientist in the study of ethology and evolution. He appears in the [[Season Ten]] episodes, ""[[Go God Go]]"" and ""[[Go God Go XII]]"".

When [[Mrs. Garrison]] refuses to teach the subject of evolution in [[The 4th Grade|class]] due to her religious beliefs, she cites in a dismissive manner that evolution implies humans are the 'retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish squirrel'. [[Principal Victoria]] asks Mr. Dawkins to come and teach the class. Furious at being replaced Garrison makes constant attempts at interrupting Dawkins' lecture, claiming that to believe in evolution will result in them going to hell. When Dawkins responds that he doesn't believe in hell, because he is an atheist, Garrison then starts in on that, while stating that she is not a monkey. Her triad builds up until at last, she defecates into her own hand and throws it at Dawkins.

Principal Victoria threatens to suspend Garrison for her actions, but Dawkins who has found Garrison attractive from their initial meeting halts the action, claiming that Garrison is simply passionate in her beliefs. Victoria agrees to look the other way this time, and as Garrison and Dawkins leave, Dawkins asks Garrison out on a date, to Garrison's immense joy.

Over steaks, Dawkins compliments Garrison on her in-your-face attitude and laments that Garrison is not an atheist. Afraid of losing the only man who's found her attractive since her sex-change, Garrison abruptly dismisses her religious beliefs, claiming that she is now an atheist. Dawkins and Garrison go back to her place to have sex.

As a result of their night of sex, Garrison throws herself into atheism, claiming that there is no God, and abusing [[Stan Marsh]] when he suggests that evolution is not the ""why"" by the ""how"". Dawkins is unsettled by Garrison's abuse of Stan, but Garrison dismisses it, saying that Dawkins was too easy on religion and that if they became more hardcore, they could change the world.

This proves true, as together Dawkins and Garrison create a war-torn Atheist future based on logic and reason, over faith and religion. In the future, there are three groups of Atheists who are set upon an endless war over ""the great question"" which is what is the most logical name to call themselves.

This future, however, is averted by [[Eric Cartman]], who after freezing himself and ending up in the future, uses a [[Crank Prank Time Phone]], to call Mrs. Garrison. Dawkins answers the phone while he sodomizes Garrison, and Cartman asks to speak to Mr. Garrison. Confused, Dawkins informs Cartman that ""Mr."" Garrison is dead, but that his wife is there. In his impatience, Cartman screams that he doesn't care what Garrison is calling himself since his sex change, so long as he puts him on the phone.

Dawkins freezes in mid-thrust, realizing that Mrs. Garrison used to be a man. Horrified, he rushes out of the house naked, with a furious and hurt Garrison calling him a ""fag"" who is going to hell. The fact that Garrison and Dawkins do not get married and stay together alters the future into a slightly more peaceful world, where the chief conflict is the French-Chinese wanting to claim Hawaii.

Richard has shiny, gray hair, various facial wrinkles, and black eyebrows. He wears a light gray shirt, gray sweater, and dark gray pants. 
He is extremely intelligent, well-informed and educated (despite not knowing that Garrison was originally a man the whole time they where together), and also demonstrates expertise in Evolution by Natural Selection. He is also kind, even going as far as to keep [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] out of trouble, even though she threw her own feces at him. Much like the actual Richard Dawkins, he is portrayed as being harsh and polemic, rejecting people of faith, and successfully trying to talk to Ms. Garrison out of faith. His teachings even created a world where religion was non-existent and laughed at.

Upon discovering that their son [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] and [[the Boys]] need to write a current event report in front of the Town Council (in order to prove to them that [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] is a competent teacher), Mr. Tweak decides to use the boys to push his agenda regarding Hardbucks. He proceeds to write a long-winded paper about how big business is destroying small family-owned businesses. The speech works, causing the town to turn against Harbucks and try to push through a legal proposition to outlaw Harbucks.

While Richard is thrilled at having used the kids to push his beliefs, Mrs. Tweak is disgusted by her husband's behavior, wanting nothing more to do with it. When the boys later discover from the [[Underpants Gnomes]] that big corporations are good, she joins the boys and explains to the town that Harbucks got to where it was by being the best. Richard, realizing she is right, makes amends with the owner of Harbucks, who asks him to run the South Park branch.

When he next appears in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", Richard tells Tweek that when he was in high school, all the young men were after Mrs. Tweak, but she only had eyes for Richard. One day, a football player who went by the name ""Quib"" wanted her, and he challenged Richard to a fight. Richard doesn't say what happened after that, other than that Quib moved away.

His next major appearance was in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", in which the men and boys of South Park begin obsessing over the new Metrosexuality fad caused by [[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]. At first, the wives love the new versions of their husbands and sons, but soon realize that it's not as good as they initially thought. When the men and boys become too wimpy and shallow, the wives realize that they preferred their husbands been strong men. The wives then proceed to go to New York, where they then kill the Queer Eye guys, who are revealed to be [[Crab People]].

They appear to have reopened their coffee house by ""[[201]]"", the family is seen outside of it and Richard expresses worry that [[Mecha-Streisand]] will destroy their coffee shop.

Richard wears a burgundy-red sweater and grayish-blue jeans. In earlier seasons, his sweater has a name tag bearing ""Mr. Tweek"". His hair is short, curly, and dark brown, with a rather long, pointed nose.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he wears a teal headband, maroon gym sweater and sweatpants, and white shoes.
Richard talks calmly which is completely opposite of jittery Tweek. He often gets lost in his own little world where he repeats cliché metaphors about how good something is. When he does this, he speaks in a somber tone of voice, accompanied by calm music.

Judging from the events of ""[[Gnomes]]"", he appears to be manipulative, exploiting [[Tweek Tweak|his son]] and [[The Boys|the boys]] in order to help run [[Harbucks]] out of town. Generally, his relaxed nature serves as a contrast to his son Tweek.

Richard and Mrs. Tweak has a son, whom they have named after the family name. Unlike either of his parents, Tweek has blond hair. This could mean that he is a throwback to an older ancestor. Richard has been shown to attempt a strong male-bonding with his son. Whenever Tweek is spazzing out over something, Richard will try his best to calm him down, usually by giving him coffee. Both parents seem unaware of the fact that caffeine is what causes Tweek's paranoia and hyperactivity in the first place. Richard apparently pays for therapy for his son, though it doesn't seem to have worked. Tweek alleges, however, that his parents ""never help"" in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"" and bangs his head into the table, with his parents not noticing. In ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", it is shown that despite sometimes using abusive methods towards their son for his own safety, they care deeply for him like any normal parents and are only trying to protect him.

Richard is married to Mrs. Tweak. They are shown to have a good relationship, however, in ""[[Gnomes]]"", Richard seemed oblivious to his wife's objection to what he was doing.

As [[the New Kid]] searches for [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] in the [[Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse|coffee house]], Richard was seen rushing Tweek in sampling coffee brews. The New Kid later assisted in collecting a pack of coffee from the [[McCormick Residence]], and following that Richard allows Tweek to go out and play with the other boys.

The Dark Roast can be purchased from Richard which is used for [[Nonconformist]].

During [[Ghost Reconciler]], Richard sees that the New Kid is trying to help mend relations between Tweek and Craig, and passes the New Kid a notice for a counselling session.

Rob Reiner,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Rob_Reiner,,"is an American celebrity best known for his portrayal of Micheal ""Meathead"" Stivic from the TV show ""All in the Family"" and his political activism. He first appeared in ""[[Butt Out]]"" as a primary antagonist.

When [[The Boys|the boys]] accidentally burn down [[South Park Elementary]] after smoking so they wouldn't end up becoming like the people in the Butt Out anti-smoking assembly, they are quick to deny personal blame, instead saying that it was the tobacco industry who convinced them to smoke. The parents, more than willing to believe their story, then summon the greatest Anti-smoking lobbyist alive: Rob Reiner to help stop the tobacco company in South Park.

Reiner (poorly disguised as a woman called 'Rita Poon') takes the boys to the tobacco factory in order to photoshop a picture of the boys smoking. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] gains a strong admiration to Rob Reiner because of his reputation to impose his will on other people and eventually, he hires Cartman to be in a commercial making him say that second-hand smoking gave him cancer and he is going to die. Cartman soon becomes suspicious because his creepy henchmen offered him a presumably poisonous cupcake in order to kill him and make the commercial seem more ""real"".

[[File:ButtOut096.png|thumb|Rob after being struck by Cartman.]]
The Boys rush to the tobacco company for protection, as Reiner leads the townsfolk to riot against the company. However, when the boys admit that they chose to smoke on their own and that Reiner is a fascist liar, the town decides that smoking shouldn't be banned. Cartman then states that he doesn't admire Rob Reiner anymore. so he stabs him with a fork, causing him to deflate with green goo pouring out of him, killing him, showing him to be inhuman.

Reiner later appears in ''South Park's'' [[200]]th Episode. After [[Tom Cruise]] is insulted (yet again) by [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], Cruise joins forces with Reiner (who apparently survived his fork stabbing or was resurrected somehow) to rally together all of the [[Celebrities]] that South Park has ever met and insulted to plot against the town. Initially, it appears that they simply intend to file a class-action lawsuit against the town, however Cruise reveals that his true intent is to kidnap the Muslim Prophet [[Muhammad]], and steal from him his power to never be mocked and ridiculed.

To accomplish this, Rob Reiner devises a machine that will steal the ""goo"" that is supposedly inside all beings (such as the goo that melted out of him), and which will transfer Muhammad's anti-ridicule power. When South Park however is unable to hand over Muhammad, due to threats made by the [[Ginger Separatist Movement]], Cruise demands that they launch their own attack against South Park. Reiner suggests they use ""her"". It turns out that Reiner has managed to salvage and re-build [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]], who the celebrities then unleash against South Park. Later in [[201]], the Celebrities and Gingers work together, they use Reiner's machine to transfer the goo from Muhammad into Tom Cruise. However, the plan proves unsuccessful, as Cruise is still able to be mocked.

Rob Reiner is a massively obese man with flushed cheeks, a thick white/greyish beard and completely bald on top. He wears black pants and horrific multi-colored ""Cosby"" sweaters, that often rise-up over his massive belly. He is usually shown eating a burger or a drumstick and wiping down his sweat-covered forehead.

He is manipulative, using children to get smoking banned as well as thinking his opinion matters above everyone else's, despite how ridiculous this may be. Ironically, he constantly eats junk food at an extremely unhealthy rate, which can be just as hazardous as smoking, showing that he prioritizes stopping others from smoking while hypocritically overlooking his own faults and health. Cartman labels his authoritarian, domineering attitude ""fascist"".

Saddam Hussein,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Saddam_Hussein,,"was the former president and dictator of [[Iraq]] between July 1979 and April 2003. He first appeared in ''[[South Park]]'' in the [[Season Two]] episode, ""[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]"". Shortly before the [[American-Canadian War]], he was killed by a pack of wild boars and became [[Satan]]'s jealous, emotionally abusive, and manipulative ex-boyfriend. He was a recurring character in ''South Park'', and the main antagonist of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

[[File:Saddam Hussein Toms Rhinoplasty.png|left|thumb|Saddam with [[Ms. Ellen]].]]
Hussein first made a very brief cameo in ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", in an image shown by some Iraqis to the third grade class as evidence of [[Ms. Ellen]] being Hussein's mistress. He does not have the Canadian look in the photograph nor does he have a real life photo of his face. Her connection to him is a significant plot point that results in Ms. Ellen's ultimate death.

Hussein first appeared in ""[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]"", in which he kidnapped [[Celine Dion]] and tried to take over [[Canada]]. He launched an assault on Canada, sneaking his troops through the air lines, with the Canadians not noticing the large numbers of Saddam's troops moving in. By the end of the episode, he managed to take over most of Canada, although he was killed when all the Canadians farted, and later becomes a very visible resident of [[Hell]].

In ""[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]"", Hussein is briefly seen with Satan welcoming [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' television producer to Hell. This is where it is first hinted he has a relationship with Satan, as he is seen holding hands with him.

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', he is the secondary, later true main antagonist. Hussein continues his romantic relationship with Satan as he plans to conquer the world by taking advantage of Satan's power as ruler. Also, in the film, it was stated at the start that he got killed by a pack of wild boars six weeks earlier. That was an error because boars never killed him in the show, as he died in ""Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus"" due to a ""mass fart"". He uses his position of power over Satan to launch an invasion of earth after the American-Canadian war made it possible for him to enter, and his demons briefly manage to take over the world. US soldiers tried to shoot him, but he was shown to be immune to their weaponry. He is defeated after Cartman hits him with several powerful electrical shocks from his rewired V-chip (Cartman generates the electricity by swearing), and when Satan, tired of his abuse, throws the weakened Saddam off a cliff and back into Hell, where he lands on a large stalagmite and is impaled. He is later seen briefly singing [[Mountain Town (Reprise)]] while still impaled on the stalagmite.

In ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"", Saddam returns to Hell, having nowhere else to go after his death, and tries to move in with Satan. He constantly murders Satan's new boyfriend, [[Chris]], however he keeps coming back since they are already in hell.

In ""[[Probably]]"", Satan deals with his decision to choose his current boyfriend over Saddam. He ends up choosing neither, and as punishment for Saddam's abusive, manipulative actions, banishes him to heaven to live with Mormons. He finds their kindness unbearable.

[[File:ALaddertoHeaven152.png|thumb|Saddam's ""Chocolate Chip factory""]]
Hussein also appears briefly in ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"" when he is suspected by the US government of building a chemical weapons plant in [[Heaven]]. Being the manipulative character that he embodies in ''South Park'', he even convinces [[God]] that he could not possibly be building chemical weapons in Heaven, despite the fact that he himself admits his cover up for the plant, a chocolate chip factory, is easily see-through.

In ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", pictures of Saddam are seen on some buildings when [[Santa Claus]] is flying around Iraq.

He is also one of the forms the alien [[Najix]] takes in ""[[Cancelled]]"".

He also appeared in ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"", in which [[Christopher Reeve]] called the attention of all the bad guys in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], including Hussein, [[David Blaine]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Kim Jong-il]], [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], his sidekick [[General Disarray]] and others. He recommends ""killing all the infidels"" as opposed to getting rid of [[Gene Hackman]]. Although it is unknown how he returned to Earth from Heaven, God may have discovered his cookie factory was a cover for weapons of mass destruction exiled him to Earth.

In ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", Hussein appears as the man in a shallow alcove behind a curtain controlling the Prime Minister of Canada, in a dual reference to the Great Oz of ''The Wizard of Oz'' and his real life hiding from the US infantry in a pit under a tent. He makes many new, unnecessarily hateful and eccentric laws, including one that forced Ike to leave the US and move to Canada. The boys travel to Canada to get Ike back, coming across several other people who were affected by Saddam's laws. When they finally reach Saddam, he kills Kenny with lasers, and refuses to give Ike back to his brother. When Kyle asks ""What the hell is wrong with you? What kind of Prime Minister bases all his decisions on hatred?"" he is unveiled as the Prime Minister of Canada, and is promptly arrested by Canadian soldiers. He is last seen being paraded through a city on a float, with the Canadians celebrating his capture similar to how Iraqi's spontaneously took to the streets after his real life capture.

If you look very carefully in ""[[A Million Little Fibers]]"" when it shows the reporter from the Middle East, you can see a portrait of Hussein in the background.

Saddam Hussein appears as any other Canadian character except his head is a cut out of the real person. He has a floppy head, a high-pitched voice and wears dark gray pants, a dark brown military jacket, and black shoes.

In the episode ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", his face is picture of him, with damaged skin and messy hair and beard, after he was dragged from a hidey-hole some days before the episode aired.
Saddam Hussein on ''South Park'' has mannerisms that differ from the real Saddam. Firstly, he speaks English only, secondly, he talks in a whiny, high pitched voice, and thirdly, he is homosexual. He also is shown to be very manipulative, often accomplishing his tasks fairly easily due to the stupidity of nearly everyone around him, even God and Satan at times.

He often creates diabolical schemes to take over the world. Most prominently in the film, where he manipulated his boyfriend Satan into invading earth, just so Saddam could push him aside and assume control of the world himself. He also organizes a gambit to invade Canada, sneaking his soldiers through the airlines in ""[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]"" and apparently built a chemical weapons plant to take over the world in ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"".

His most recent plot was to become the Prime Minister of Canada by tricking the Canadians. He becomes the Prime Minister for a short time, but is defeated when the boys find out who he really is, and Canadian soldiers arrest him.

Saddam appears to be very sadistic, as evidenced by his torture of Kenny in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', he is heavily implied to have a sexual fetish for it. Similarly, Saddam appears to be very sex-crazed. He satisfies both his lust for power and his sex cravings by being in a homosexual relationship with Satan, whom he is very abusive towards.

As shown in ""[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]"" and ""[[Probably]]"" his first instinct when his relationship with Satan is threatened when Satan finds a new, much kinder [[Chris|boyfriend]] is to murder said boyfriend, and his first reaction after Satan breaks up with him is to constantly stalk him.

He is a self-proclaimed psychopath, as evidenced in his song ""[[I Can Change]]"", which contained the following lyrics:
''""I like to kill I like to maim but its OK because I can change!""'', during which he kills a dancer by breaking her back. He also apparently had abusive parents, as evidenced by other lyrics from the same song:

''""Its not my fault, that I'm, so evil its society. society. You see my parents were sometimes abusive, and it made a prick of me.""'' During these lyrics caricatures of Saddam's parents are seen physically abusing their infant son.

Saddam also is depicted as very power hungry, greedy, and dishonest. On one occasion, he is shown to be a religious extremist, as evidenced by his line in ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"", where he recommends ""Death to the infidels"" as opposed to getting rid of [[Gene Hackman]].

Saint Patrick,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Saint_Patrick,,"was a Romano-British Christian missionary, who serves as the primary patron saint of Ireland but was never actually canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Patrick was only proclaimed a saint by popular acclaim. He appears in the [[Season Twenty-Five]] episode ""[[Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special]]"".

[[Butters Stotch]], who had been arrested for sexual harassment on [[Annie|a female student]] at [[South Park Elementary]], escapes from [[Park County Police Station|the police station]] with the help of [[Randy Marsh]], which was captured on CCTVs and reported on the news. While at the [[Farty O'Cool's Irish Pub]] (where a St. Patrick's Day party is being held), some of the patrons recognize the ""sexual predator"" from the news. The [[Park County Police Force|police force]] soon arrived and have Butters surrounded, but was interrupted by Saint Patrick's appearance. Saint Patrick objects to the arrest of Butters for simply touching people on St. Patrick's Day, and blames the people for ""besmirching a perfectly good white holiday."" He then proceeds to pinch and grope several female patrons, and invites the males to flop their dicks out, calling them ""Scottish poofters"" when they refuse to do so. He further claims that St. Patrick's Day is celebrated for ""four"" reasons, albeit spelling them out: ""I. Love. To fuck."" His behavior caused much disgust to the patrons, causing them to leave the party and discard any weed that they possess.

Saint Patrick is portrayed in a classical art style. He wears a green bishop mitre with gold trims, green robe top and white bottoms.

Saint Peter,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Saint_Peter,,"(born as: '''Shimon Bar-Yona''' in Bethsaida, Judea) was a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of [[Jesus Christ]].


During the Last Supper, Jesus selected the white rabbit to be the first Pope as he knew no man can speak for God without becoming corrupt while rabbits are pure. But as the years went by, the Catholic Church deemed the idea of a rabbit running for Pope to be a form of sacrilege so they portrayed Saint Peter as a man and buried the truth.

Saint Peter whose true form is that of a rabbit is the secret leader of [[Hare Club for Men]] and a rival of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] as seen in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"".

Despite being portrayed as a rabbit in ""[[Fantastic Easter Special]]"", he physically appears in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", and is seen as a human guarding the gates of [[Heaven]], guiding [[Kenny McCormick]] who was previously ran over by a car, introducing him to the angels. 

Saint Peter is also mentioned in the song ""[[Sixteen Tons]]"".

Her hair is similar to that of Red's, except that Sally lacks bangs, and she has a pink clip tying her hair back on the right.

It is possible she wears a bra, despite her age, and stuffs it. However, chances are she does not, as [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the others on the ''Sexy Action News'' squad in ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"" claimed they should ""make up stories of kids and present it on the news"".

Santa's very first appearance was in ''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]'': Jesus vs. Frosty when the boys beg Santa for help when their friend [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], then known as [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], dies. He quickly turns in to Frosty, killing then known as [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]].
[[File:Santa 1992 version.jpg|thumb|The boys begging Santa for help in [[The Spirit of Christmas]]: Jesus vs. Frosty.]]
[[File:Jesusvsanta.gif|thumb|left|Santa and Jesus Christ in ''[[The Spirit of Christmas#Jesus vs. Santa|The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Santa]]''.]]
Santa made his first official appearance on ''South Park'' during ''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]'', in which Jesus appears before [[The Boys|the boys]], stating that has a bone to pick with ""Kringle"". According to Jesus, Santa has diminished the memory of Jesus' birthday with his presents. Santa is aware of the feud, and claims that ""this time"", they will ""finish it"". The pair then begin fighting Mortal Kombat-style, during which they inadvertently kill Kenny. The boys, uncertain who to root for, ask ""What Would [[Brian Boitano]] Do?"" The figure skater miraculously appears and holds a speech about how Christmas should be about being good to each other. The boys transmit the message to the fighters, who ashamedly agree and decide to bury the hatchet over an orange smoothie.

Santa would later appear in a cameo during ""[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]"", in which he is seen at the mall, listening to the children's present request. Later he swings by South Park to pick up [[Mr. Hankey]] who intends to help Santa deliver presents.

Santa and Jesus would then team-up again during ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"", in which the duo are performing at a night club lounge, and singing jazzy versions of their Christmas Carols. As Jesus however begins becoming more selfish and arrogant during the performance, singing a larger variety of songs dedicated to him, Santa becoming obviously annoyed, hinting at their old rivalry from before. As Santa intends to storm off the stage, however, Jesus calls him back the pair does a melody of songs as friends.

Santa is next seen in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", during which [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] in the hopes of overshadowing all his naughty behavior with one big good deed, convinces Santa to deliver Christmas to the Middle East. Santa's sleigh however is shot down over Baghdad, his legs are broken and he is taken as a prisoner. The Iraq Soldiers, assuming he's an American spy, begin to torture him, and shocking Santa's testicles in order to get information out of him. [[The Boys|The boys]], along with [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], [[Mr. Hankey]] and the [[Underpants Gnomes]], launch a rescue operation. They manage to rescue Santa (Jesus heals his broken legs) and Santa murders the lead Iraq Soldier saying ""I couldn't... I couldn't let him live! He shocked Santa's balls!"" During their escape, however, Jesus is killed and grieving Santa killed the remaining soldiers, before accomplishing his mission of bringing Christmas to Iraq. He later informs South Park that Christmas would, from that day forward, be a day to honor his fallen friend, Jesus Christ.

Santa then appeared in ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"", during which [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] helps the Satanic [[Woodland Critters]] rise the [[Anti-Christ]], resulting in a pentagram in the sky. Santa notices this and learns of the [[Anti-Christ]] and kills it.

In ""[[Imaginationland]]"", it is revealed that he is the greatest fighter of all the imaginary creatures. When the wall that separates the evil imaginary characters from the good ones is destroyed during a terrorist attack, Santa was killed in the chaos. However, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] after much effort was able to recreate Santa with his imagination, allowing for the good characters to get the upper hand. At least until the US Government blew up Imaginationland, and Butters had to re-imagine everything.

In ""[[201]]"", he was wearing a bear mascot costume pretending to be [[Muhammad]], at the suggestion of [[Mr. Hankey]].

In ""[[Let Go, Let Gov]]"", he is being held prisoner by the NSA and made part of a super computer used to track all Americans. Cartman revealed the info on this to the American people however nobody cared, though at some point Santa was freed.

Santa returns in the [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode ""[[Bike Parade]]"" to help the [[South Park (Location)|town]] with Christmas presents, but becomes greatly frustrated with them after finding out they got rid of Mr. Hankey simply for posting crude Tweets; as such, he leaves the town to deal with the situation themselves.

Santa Claus in South Park is depicted very similar to the version of Santa Claus in American culture; a jolly old man with a thick white beard and usually smiling. He wears a red coat and pants, lined with white fur, as well as a sleighing hat of red and white fur. He wears an oversized black belt around his heavy bellied waist, and black boots and gloves.

Santa is essentially a kindly father/grandfather figure, whose highest belief is that that there should be joy and goodwill, particularly during Christmas time. Often laughing with his trademarked ""Ho-Ho-Ho"" and his unwavering desire to give gifts to all the good boys and girls of the world.

However, one should not assume that because Santa is considered a 'jolly old elf' that he does not have a dark side. Santa has become slightly bitter of the years, having to constantly compete with [[Jesus Christ]] for the spotlight during Christmas time. In fact, on two separate occasions, the pair have argued and even fought physically over who is the more important Christmas figure. Santa can also hold a grudge against those who mistreat himself and others, as seen when he killed an Iraq soldier, who had spent Christmas Eve torturing him, and shocking ""Santa's Balls"".

Despite his age and kindly nature, Santa is skilled in martial arts and weapons, as demonstrated in his epic battle against [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] and more so during the events of ""[[Imaginationland]]"", during which he was one of the greatest fighters of all the imaginary characters.

During the [[Woodland Critters]] battle in the ''Farts of the Future Past'' mission, Santa joins the New Kid to help take the critters down. In this battle, Santa becomes a playable character after the New Kid prays for Jesus's help and accidentally crashes his sleigh. After the Woodland Critters have been defeated, Santa offers his help to deal with the chaos happening in South Park.

Her husband [[Matthew Broderick]], is interviewed while at the Oscars, about his wife being referenced in the book, while Sarah Jessica stands behind him. Although Matthew attempts to defend his wife's appearance, he is thrown off when the reporter then asks ""How come a transvestite-donkey-witch is standing next to you and why is it wearing a dress?""

In order to get back at Butters for taking claim of their book, the boys attempt to get the book banned talking to the school board, along with Sarah Jessica Parker. The board however rejects their opinion that the book is vulgar for the sake of vulgarity, and instead claims that they do not understand the book's meaning (which in-truth, there is none according to the boys). Still wanting revenge, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] then suggests that they kill Sarah Jessica Parker and claim that Butter's book provoked her murder, just as ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' was supposedly responsible for the murder of John Lennon. Although [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], reject the idea, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] agrees to it and together he and Cartman set up Sarah Jessica Parker in the woods, dressing her up as a moose and making moose calls to get her shot by hunters. After she is found dead in the woods, the boys later place the blame on Butters. Butters however is unconcerned saying, ""Oh, that's okay. At least she was ugly"".

However, she eventually came back to life because she appears in ""[[200]]"". Though she can be seen arguing at the beginning, her voice is never heard.

Sarah Jessica Parker is portrayed as extremely unattractive, in an unflattering and exaggerated version of her real life appearance. With an overly-large head, close-set eyes and heavy brows, her dull brown hair is pulled into a tight bun at the back of her head. She has a massive, prominent nose, and heavy mascara, giving her eyes a sunken appearance and making them look unusually small. She also has a large mole on the right side of her chin. She always wears the same vacant expression, even when being insulted.

Throughout the episode, she is seen wearing a canary yellow ball gown that she wore in the 2010 Academy Awards show.

She speaks with a nearly identical Minnesotan accent that is used by [[Principal Victoria]]. However, when talking to the thief club, she talks with a British accent.

Sarah Peterson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Sarah_Peterson,,"In ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", she seeks help from [[The Boys|the boys]], who were playing detective, to find her lost doll. They find the doll in Fosse's house, where [[Bill]] and [[Fosse]] are playing with it. The boys go in and retrieve the doll, and return it to Sarah later. Her mom is so appreciative that she advises the [[Park County Police]] department of their heroism.

Sarah has long orange hair with yellow ribbons tied in bows to give her pigtails. She wears a yellow dress with green and white trimming. She also wears black shoes and a white skirt.

Sarah Valmer,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Sarah_Valmer,,"is [[Jimmy Valmer]]'s mother and [[Ryan Valmer]]'s wife. She first appears in ""[[Krazy Kripples]]"", suspecting Jimmy has joined a gang.

In ""[[Fishsticks]]"", she offers Jimmy and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] fruits and vegetables for a snack to replace Cartman's chips, before saving Jimmy from a black widow spider. Cartman would later misremember both events, with himself killing the spider, and Sarah bringing them chips and telling him he's ""handsome and not even remotely fat"".

Sarah wears a white shirt with a noticeable amount of cleavage, underneath is an orange sleeveless dress, with a white belt around her waist. Her hair is almost wavy, long and black, and like most of the moms in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], she wears red lipstick. Her breasts seem to be quite large and full-shaped, this being different from most of the South Park women, who are often portrayed as flat until they take off their shirt.

Little is known about her personality, but she apparently can get very emotional, as in [[Krazy Kripples]], when she and Ryan try to get Jimmy out of the gang he's joined, but when he refuses, she bursts into tears.

Satan,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Satan,,"was the ruler of [[Hell]], and he often found his way up to the town of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] to carry out his nefarious, and occasionally harmless, schemes. He is openly homosexual. Despite being evil incarnate, he has a compassionate and vulnerable personality.

He serves as a major antagonist in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. He also appeared in sympathetic roles in episodes such as ""[[Probably]]"", ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"", and ""[[Freemium Isn't Free]]"".

He battles [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]] in ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"", only to be subdued and killed by the beast, after which he ascends to [[Heaven]] (which is considered ironic, as Satan was formerly an angel who became the ruler of Hell following his banishment from Heaven).

When he fights [[Jesus Christ]], he had the advantage over his component in terms of both height and muscular strength, giving him an edge during the boxing match. His strength is also shown when he kills [[Saddam Hussein]] for the first time in ""[[Probably]]"", as he is able to easily carry him and throw him into a spike in Hell. In ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"", when he realizes that his Halloween party was ruined, he hits [[Zazul]], sending the latter flying across the screen.
*'''Fire Manipulation:''' After he becomes upset with [[Chris]], Satan burns one of his own minions using this ability. He did the same to Saddam Hussein in Hell, but it was unable to kill him since he was already dead and in Hell. Satan has never been seen using this power on Earth, except for when he [[Possessed Stan Marsh|possessed Stan Marsh]] as his human host, during which time he used it against the Canadian devil Beelzaboot.
*'''Dimensional Travel:''' Satan is able to travel between dimensions such as [[Heaven]] and Hell at will as shown in ""[[Probably]]"". He also travels to Earth on several occasions, such as to fight Jesus in ""[[Damien]]"", or when preparing for his Halloween party in ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"".
*'''Flight:''' When Stan is possessed by Satan, he is seen with the ability to fly.
*'''Weather Manipulation: '''In the episode ""[[Damien]]"", he manipulates the weather in order to impress the South Park townsfolk.
*'''Injury Immunity:''' During ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', in which he attempts to take over the world, he and his minions are unaffected by the weaponry of the U.S. military. This implies that he is impervious to physical harm to some extent. He is, however, defeated by ManBearPig in ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"", though this could be due to the fact that ManBearPig is an immortal being himself.
*'''Reality Warping:''' To thank [[Kenny McCormick]] for helping him find the strength to defeat Saddam, Satan promised grant him a wish. Per the boy's request, the demon leader warped reality to make it so that all the damages caused by the war and himself are reversed.
*'''Absorbing Vortex Creation:''' In ""[[Freemium Isn't Free]]"", he defeats Beelzaboot by creating a hole that absorbs the Canadian devil.

Satan was openly bisexual, as he was in a relationship with [[Saddam Hussein]], later with a new lover, [[Chris]], and yet another lover in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"". Despite this, he does have a biological son named [[Damien Thorn|Damien]]. Satan is not content with his lot in eternity, and has in the past tried to take over the surface world.

He is not without compassion, however, and has shown that he has a good heart several times in the past, as when he granted Kenny a wish for helping him with his love life in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. He is actually shown to be very submissive and sensitive, likely the result of all the abuse he suffered at the hands of his previous boyfriend Saddam Hussein. Although he may seem dark and evil at time, his darker moments are just acts, and he is genuinely a nice person.

Satan is an accomplished singer, has had a boxing match with [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] once, and has showcased other talents several times in the past. His voice sounds similar to that of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], though it is much deeper and lower. This is more obvious at the end of the movie when he speaks with Mr. Hat's voice by saying, ""Sure, Mr. Satan"".

[[File:ManBearPig_vs_Satan.png|thumb|[[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]] proves triumphant in his battle against Satan in ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]""; Satan later dies from his injuries.]]
In ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"", Satan accepts to help the boys and save the town from [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]]. He starts a fight with the demon by approaching him while he is killing a townsman. ManBearPig sees Satan and suddenly leaps onto a car, slashing at him and sending him to the ground. After grappling for a few seconds, ManBearPig grabs Satan's left horn, rips it off, drives it into Satan's chest and throws him to the ground. After a few punches, he runs away and leaves Satan on the ground, fatally injured.

After the fight, [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick]] quickly approach Satan as he dies. He tells the boys to keep trying and take down ManBearPig. As his spirit rises to [[Heaven]], a small bell tolls and he gets angel wings.

Satan is a large red, humanoid creature with heavy musculature. He wears black shorts, black hooves, and a black belt with blue trimming and a skull belt buckle. He has yellow horns on his head and yellow eyes. He knees point outward when we walks or stands. The design of Satan is modeled after the mythological Greek Satyr, half goat/half man.

Since ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", Satan's appearance has been redesigned, he now has less beard, his biceps appear to be sturdier, and grooves are added to his horns.

As explained by Alec Vaughn in ""[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]"", Satan was ""one of the most powerful entities, supposedly, in the universe"", despite the fact that he was easily killed by [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]], while he only used his super strength like muscles against him. However, the Canadian devil [[Beelzaboot]] was easy defeated by him, since he possessed [[Stan Marsh]] as human host to use his own supernatural powers such as fire rays or the hole that absorbing anything in [[Hell]]. It is unknown how truly powerful Satan was, but he was among South Park's strongest creatures which include [[God]], ManBearPig, and [[Cthulhu]]. His powers include, but are not limited to:
[[File:Probably014.png|thumb|Satan and Saddam together in ""[[Probably]]"".]]
Saddam Hussein is Satan's abusive gay lover in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. They are also seen together in ""[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]"". Saddam Hussein is incredibly abusive towards Satan, often manipulating him into going along with his plans. After [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] helps Satan realize that Satan does not need Saddam, the pair stop seeing each other regularly. However, despite being involved with a new partner, [[Chris]], Satan still harbored some feelings for Saddam, which manifested in ""[[Probably]]"".

[[File:Probably031.png|thumb|Satan with Chris in ""[[Probably]]"".]]
Chris was Satan's new boyfriend in ""[[Probably]]"". Their relationship is much more mutually friendly, as Chris was kind and helpful to Satan. However, Satan's submissive personality led him to seek out a dominant partner, similar to his old boyfriend, Saddam, which led to Chris and Saddam repeatedly killing each other for Satan's love. By the end of the episode, with some advice from [[God]], Satan decides that he does not need either Chris or Saddam.

Kevin is Satan's conniving ex-boyfriend, and former personal assistant and advisor. Like Satan's previous love interests, Kevin proved himself to be no good for him. In the episode, ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", Kevin attempts to have his boyfriend removed from his position of power in [[Hell]] through means of [[Kenny McCormick]]. However, his plans are foiled, and he is dumped. He was subsequently murdered by Satan.

Scott Malkinson,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Scott_Malkinson,,"is a character introduced in the episode ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"". He has a lisp and diabetes, which [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] rips on him for. [[The Boys|The boys]] use him to replace [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], who has begun to try to learn how to do musicals to prevent himself from losing [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] to [[Bridon Gueermo]].

He has had several background appearances since his debut. He appears in the episode ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", as a customer of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]'s ""kissing company"", and passes at the background during [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s bookselling in the episode ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"".

He later appears in the Black Friday trilogy where he is seen sharpening a wooden sword in Cartman's backyard in the episode ""[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]"", ""sword fighting"" with Butters Stotch. He then joins Butters on a trip to [[George R. R. Martin]]'s house to find out what will happen when the dragons come.

In ""[[Going Native]]"", Scott is mentioned to have been beaten up by Butters Stotch. In ""[[Gluten Free Ebola]]"", everyone is using Scott as a scapegoat for avoiding gluten.

In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", Scott continually pesters the school counselor [[Mr. Mackey]] about quitting [[Twitter]] because everyone is ignoring him.

In the timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he becomes the priest at the [[South Park Church]].

Scott wears a light green jacket with a fairly dark green collar and has teal trousers or light blue jeans. He has freckles and short, ruffled brown hair parted in the middle, and has prominent ears. Most of the time, Scott is seen with his tongue hanging out. He has an obvious lisp.

When he goes to sleep, he wears white formal pajamas with light blue stripes (shown in ""[[Skank Hunt]]"") or formal light blue pajamas with red cars.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Scott appears as an adult man. The fringes of his hair grew and are graying on the sides, and has wrinkles and ears. He wears a black priest uniform with a black belt. In addition, he still has his lisp.

Scott Malkinson doesn't appear to be the brightest kid around. He doesn't know that he's uncool, at one point asking, ""What's so bad about hanging out with me?"" He does make some half-hearted attempts to stop Cartman's teasing, especially when it comes to his diabetes, but these are ultimately futile, simply fueling Cartman's ridicule. 
Clark is Scott's father. Their relationship appears to be poor, as when Scott asks if they can subscribe to the streaming service Disney+, Clark becomes very angry at Scott. When Clark leaves to go to work, Scott angrily calls him an ""asshole."" 
Ellen is Scott's mother. They seem to have a good relationship, as when she approves of Scott inviting a girl with diabetes to watch TV at their house.

Cartman takes pleasure in ridiculing Scott for his diabetes, often mockingly imitating his distinctive lisp. Scott tries to protest, saying ""Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!"" and ""That's enough, you guys, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes!"", but Cartman disregards this and continues.

In ""[[Basic Cable]]"", Scott goes to Cartman for relationship advice.

Most of the boys appear originally to have a negative impression of Scott Malkinson due to his awkward personality and lack of popularity, but their attitude becomes progressively become more neutral in later years. He is repeatedly silenced and ridiculed by Eric Cartman when trying to speak or interact with his peers and is mocked for his lisp and diabetes. [[Kenny McCormick]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]] both appear to be ambivalent towards Scott, often completely ignoring both him and Cartman's ridicule. However, they are well aware that their association with Scott Malkinson makes them incredibly uncool. Although he is still rather unpopular among his peers and does not appear to be particularly close to any of them, Scott has shown to be included more frequently among some of the boys in recent episodes.

He is most noticeably seen eating lunch with the main boys and their extended friend group more often in the cafeteria and seems to have befriended Eric Cartman and Butters Stotch, having been shown in their company several times in certain episodes and going to Cartman personally for relationship advice in ""[[Basic Cable]]"". He also seems to have bonded somewhat with some of the boys, including Stan Marsh and Clyde Donovan, after being seen shown as a member of their board gamers club in the episode ""Board Girls"". It is possible that although they do not necessarily like him or consider him ""cool"" to associate with, the boys have warmed up to and become more tolerant of Scott over time and are now more willing to let him hang out with or be around them.

In the future in [[South Park: Post Covid]], Scott's old classmates do not remember him when they enter the [[South Park Church]] for Kenny's funeral. The fact that he has a lisp and diabetes rings a bell for Stan. Later when an argument breaks out during the funeral, Stan ridicules Scott for his diabetes and walks out, to which Scott expresses joy that Stan now remembers him. 

Scott instantly becomes infatuated with Sophie Gray in ""Basic Cable"", after hearing that she has diabetes. He believes he has fallen in love with her almost immediately upon meeting her and feels entitled to be with Sophie on the mere basis of their shared diabetes, focusing on no other aspect of her beyond her condition. He goes to great lengths to try to impress her and lashes out angrily at any boy who tries to pursue her, feeling threatened upon witnessing several of the other boys also developing attractions to her at the school. He and Sophie arrange a meet-up at Scott's [[Malkinson Residence|house]] to watch ''The Mandalorian'', but Disney+ suddenly goes down. They go to [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]'s [[Valmer Residence|house]] to continue watching the show, but the same thing happens. Seeing the boys comforting Sophie, Scott angrily yells at them for trying to steal his girlfriend. Sophie says that she isn't his girlfriend and that she's more than just her diabetes. Scott sadly tells her that he's not.

Later that night, Scott is sitting alone in the [[South Park Elementary Playground|playground]] and Sophie comes to comfort him. She tells him that she's glad there's someone she can talk about diabetes with and that she doesn't think he's any weirder or grosser than any of the other boys in this town. She reassures Scott that she is not disappointed at having missed her show and the episode ends on a heartwarming note with Sophie saying that she is “kind of starting to like the Scott Malkinson show” as they spend quality time together. Although Sophie ultimately did not get into a romantic relationship with Scott or return his affection, she nonetheless expressed gratitude over having met someone new who could relate to the struggles diabetics face, and they remain friends.

Despite having been beat up by him in ""[[Going Native]]"", Scott and Butters seem to have a friendship, as shown by Butters' concern for Scott when he began experiencing low blood sugar due to having not eaten in ""[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]"" and ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"".

Establishing shots of the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|cafeteria]] in multiple episodes show Scott and Jason eating lunch with unnamed kids. This could indicate a possible friendship between the two. However, the two have never actually been seen interacting.

Scott is seen on the front cover of ''GameInformer'' magazine's coverage of ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''. Despite how Cartman treats Scott on the show, Scott joins sides with Cartman's human faction of the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]]. Scott quickly befriends [[Douchebag]]. After Clyde is banished by Cartman, he assumes the role of Kupa Keep's shopkeeper. Scott is later used for practice when Douchebag is trained to use the Cup-A-Spell fart.

Scott Tenorman,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Scott_Tenorman,,"is a ninth-grader and the purported 'Head Ginger'. He is also the nemesis and half-brother of [[Eric Cartman]]. He makes his first appearance in the [[Season Five]] episode ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"".

In his first appearance during ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", Scott is established quickly as a manipulative high school freshman, who unwisely chooses Cartman as his target, and ends up paying a heavy price.

When he first encountered Cartman, Scott tricked him by selling him his pubic hair for ten dollars, claiming that this meant Cartman had reached maturity. There was no financial motive for this, as Scott himself explains that his parents give him a hefty allowance. Instead, Scott was just being cruel to a fourth-grader for the sake of it.

Cartman soon learned he had been tricked and resolved to get his money back at all costs. However, Scott cheated him out of an additional $6.12, culminating in Scott making Cartman beg for his money back, then burning it in front of him. After more basic revenge plans failed and after being further humiliated by Scott with the public display of a video of Cartman begging for his money back by oinking like a pig, Cartman finally had enough. He devised an elaborate plan to have Scott's parents killed, then he ground the bodies into chili, and fed them to an unaware Scott, who became traumatized. At that time, Scott gets mocked by his favorite band, [[Radiohead]], for being a ""crybaby"", unaware that he is crying over his parents' demise.

[[File:Scotttenormanparedead.png|thumb|left|200px|Scott at his parents' grave.  [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] brought him a gift basket.]]
In the episode ""[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]"", he is seen crying over his parents' graves as Cartman and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] placed a gift basket next to him as an apology. He is also mentioned when Butters and Cartman were writing a list of the bad things Cartman has done before his supposed ""death"".

In ""[[201]]"", Scott Tenorman makes a return as the leader of the revived [[Ginger Separatist Movement]]. Mentally deranged and now with more visible braces, he apparently spent time in a mental asylum. During his stay in a said mental institution, he became obsessed with making Cartman pay for murdering his parents and did research on him and planned to torment Cartman with the identity of his real father. However, the shock was too great for Scott, so he developed a plan to force the town to present Cartman's real father to him. Apparently a [[Denver Broncos|Denver Bronco]] (right tackle) had an affair with [[Liane Cartman]] and produced an illegitimate child. The whole town covered it up because ""the Broncos were having a good year and couldn't afford any distractions."" Scott Tenorman revealed his father, [[Jack Tenorman]] was a Denver Bronco and was the only one who lived in South Park, thus Jack Tenorman was Cartman's biological father, which made Scott Tenorman Cartman's half brother. In the words of Scott, ""You killed your own father, and you fed him to your half brother!""

Cartman is horrified, and then to top it off, Scott then shoved Cartman into the same bowl of tainted chili that Scott ate back then, but a moment before Cartman eats it, the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]] bust in battling a group of [[celebrities]] and the gingers. Not yet done with his insane schemes, Scott Tenorman escapes using a jet pack, with [[Jesus]] saying ""Who's the creepy ginger kid?""

Unfortunately, Scott's plan succeeded in hurting Cartman for murdering his parents, but not only in the manner that he had hoped. Cartman did seem to regret killing their father but also loathed the idea that he is in fact, half-ginger. However, Cartman managed to find a lot of solace in the fact that [[Mitch Conner]] reminded him he was part Denver Bronco as well. Ever since then, Eric Cartman vows to get revenge on Scott Tenorman once again for the unfortunate events of this episode.

Scott has bushy red hair, freckles, large ears, and a piggish nose. He wears a gray sweater, with a black v-neck shirt overtop, baggy orange pants, yellow socks over the pants, and dark blue shoes. He also uses braces on his teeth. In ""[[201]]"", he had a wider mouth and his braces were more visible. His eyes have darkened around them, appearing to have become baggy. His hair was very messy and his pants and shoes were redesigned to look more ""realistic"". In some scenes, he also sported a top hat with a purple brim and a cane.

Scott's manipulative and somewhat sadistic nature is very similar to Cartman's at times. However, in his initial appearance, his cruelty was far more childish and more analogous to simple bullying, as opposed to Cartman's more elaborate and super-villainous methods. This changed in his appearance in ""[[201]]"" where it appears Cartman's past actions pushed him down to Cartman's level of evil. Though Scott is still less evil as he became awful due to the death of his parents while Eric became mentally ill and evil was because he was given everything by his mother.

Scott makes Cartman eat chili at the end of ""[[201]]"". It is unknown as to whether or not it was tainted with something, such as human meat, pubes, or something else, or if it was just ordinary chili used to guilt-trip Eric.

Although its canonicity is disputed, Scott Tenorman plays a major role in the video game ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' on the ""Sixth Graders' Hangout"" level as the end boss. Cartman notes he recognizes his presence. Scott's role in the overarching storyline isn't really explained. The players must block him from entering the town at all costs or the level is lost. He is not a playable character.

Scott the Dick,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Scott_the_Dick,,"first appears in [[Season Two]] episode, ""[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]"". He makes a cameo in the movie appearing on the [[Asses of Fire]] poster. He later appears in ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"" and in ""[[Royal Pudding]]"", where he was seen as a ""giant dick"".

Scott is a resident of Ontario, [[Canada]], and is the nemesis of Terrance and Phillip and notorious among his fellow Canadians. He is most well known for being ""a dick"" and driving a Chrysler PT Cruiser. (Often, when he made his entrances to the scenes in ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", the other Canadians in the same scene would shout out to the boys: ""Oh no! It's Scott! He's a ''dick''!"", or some variation thereof.) He is uptight and short-tempered, especially when it comes to Terrance and Phillip's toilet humor. Despite all of this, he claims he is the most patriotic Canadian.

In the Season Two episode, ""[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]"", he was the duo's prosecutor in court and was made [[Saddam Hussein]]'s adviser later in episode. He was Saddam's adviser again in ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", while Saddam was in disguise as Canada's new Prime Minister. However, it was stated by Scott that his official job is a journalist, i.e. a television critic for magazines.

He has brown, spiky hair. He wears dark blue jeans and a brown, long-sleeved shirt with a black capital ""S"" embroidered in the middle. In several of Scott's appearances, he wears a red tie with his shirt. Like most Canadian characters, he has small beady eyes and a flapping Pac-Man like head.

In ""[[Royal Pudding]]"", as a result of experiencing radiation poisoning in Ottawa, he appears as a giant, which causes fellow Canadians to refer to him as a ""giant dick"" (despite the fact he is only actually slightly taller than he used to be), he also wears a red tie during the episode.

He appears to be very xenophobic and racist, stating that Americans are ""power-hungry"" and was going to send the boys away, in ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"". He also largely dislike [[Inuit]] people, but seems desperate to deny that he is an ""Eskimo racist"" despite denigrating them with frequent racial slurs. In general, Scott just seems to dislike everybody.

Scrambles is the core subject for most parts of the game, where it is reported missing and a $100 reward is offered for its return. Both the [[Coon and Friends]] and [[Freedom Pals]] attempt to recover the cat so that they could receive the reward to help support their movie franchise.

Scrambles is eventually found in [[Harrison Yates]]' office during [[The Thin White Line]] mission, where Yates was using it to cheese himself. When Scrambles is recovered, an argument is heated up over which faction should get the reward, starting off another fight between both factions.

Scuzzlebutt,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Scuzzlebutt,,"is a basket-weaving monster who lives on top of a mountain in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He has a piece of celery as an arm and [[Patrick Duffy]] as a leg. He appears prominently in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Volcano]]"". He has had several cameo appearances since.

[[File:Volcano055.png|thumb|left|Cartman as Scuzzlebutt.]]
In ""[[Volcano]]"", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] tells the story of Scuzzlebutt to scare his friends, depicting him as a vicious monster, though they do not believe him. In order to scare them even more, Cartman dresses up as Scuzzlebutt. This plan failed and Cartman was almost shot.

Eventually, a volcano erupted and Cartman and the others were trapped, as the town built a trench to divert the lava away from the town. This is when Scuzzlebutt appears for real, much to Cartman's surprise, and weaves a wicker basket that saves the children. Shortly after, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] kills Scuzzlebutt to prove to his [[Jimbo Kern|Uncle Jimbo]] that he is a good nephew, but that pretty much failed.

In ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"", in-keeping with the re-imagined versions of the flashback sequences in that episode, Scuzzlebutt instead weaves some ice cream and has Brent Musburger for a leg instead of Patrick Duffy.

At the end of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Scuzzlebutt is seen in the crowd on the right while everyone is singing the ""[[Mountain Town (Reprise)|Mountain Town reprise]]"" despite the fact that he was killed way before the [[American-Canadian War]].

Skuzzlebutt is a large brown creature with Patrick Duffy as a leg and a celery stick for an arm. He has dark brown hair and a dark brown beard.

He is a kind, sweet-natured creature with a basic grasp of the English language, as he is shown able to say the words ""friend"" and ""Volcano"". He is reclusive but unafraid of humans. He is benevolent and thoughtful, as he is shown saving the boys in a wicker basket and giving some freshly-picked mountain flowers to [[Mayor McDaniels]].


Scuzzlebutt appears in the mini game called Scuzzlebutt. The monster appears at the top of a tree on fire, screaming for help. You have to extinguish the fire with water balloons and rescue Scuzzlebutt (and [[Patrick Duffy]]), before the fire reaches Scuzzlebutt/the time runs out.

Scuzzlebutt appears in South Park Rally as unlockable character (Except for Nintendo 64). In Easter Egg Hunt Race, you have to get the golden cow (Pot Pie in PlayStation Version), located near the waterfall.

Scuzzlebutt is the first playable character in the mobile game. You have to rescue some people from the volcano.

Scuzzlebutt's face sometimes appears on the game's loading screen. A stuffed and mounted Scuzzlebutt can be seen in Jimbo's Guns showroom.

Scuzzlebutt appears in the background of the [[Hermes Kenny]] and [[Hunter Jimbo]]'s card art. He also has his very own card on the game.

Scuzzlebutt serves as a boss in the unreleased game South Park (GBC), Scuzzlebutt's attacks are throwing snowballs, the player must attack him by using snowballs.","['Eric Cartman', 'Stan Marsh', 'Jimbo Kern']"
Sea People,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_People,,"are brine shrimps that made their only appearance to date in ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"". 

After having convinced [[The boys|his friends]] to help purchase the Sea People, [[Eric Cartman]] was extremely disappointed as he envisioned them to be more anthropomorphic. At the same time [[Ms. Choksondik]] recently died and was found to have semen in her stomach. The boys played a prank on her by putting the Sea People in her coffee and thought that the semen was actually the Sea People.

The boys sneak into the morgue and retrieve the semen. Thinking it was actually the Sea People, they put the semen in the aquarium. When Cartman awoke the next day, he found the Sea People had advanced into an ancient society.
[[File:TheSimpsonsAlreadyDidIt15.jpg|thumb|left|The Sea People worshipping the Cartman statue.]]
Having learned that semen advances the Sea People's growth in both society and technology, Cartman acquired ten gallons of semen by going to a [[Sperm Bank of South Park|sperm bank]] and a guy named Ralph. Using the semen he acquired, the existing Seaciety, and the new Sea People [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] purchases, Cartman combined them all in a larger aquarium. Overnight the Sea People advanced into modern civilization, worshiping both Cartman and Tweek as deities. 

The internal conflict of having the two boys as deities started a war amongst the Sea People. Soon, people from Cartman's side of the tank started to suicide-bomb the Tweek statue on Tweek's side and vice versa. After several rounds of suicide bombing, both sides destroyed each other and the fish tank with nuclear weapons.

As they appear normally, Sea People look like brine shrimps. As their society progresses with the help of semen, they acquire clothes, most notably the white toga with blue and red stripes.

As they appear in Cartman's vision, Sea People are anthropomorphic Brine Shrimps all of which wear various swim wear.

Seaman,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Seaman,,"is a member of the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]]. The name ""Seaman"" is often mispronounced as ""semen"" by other members, including the episode narrator, much to the chagrin of the superhero himself.

Modeled after Aquaman from DC Comics' Superfriends cartoon, he can breathe underwater and communicate with sea creatures. He also has an avian sidekick, Swallow, who joins him on adventures. The other Super Best Friends pronounce his name ""semen"", which Seaman will angrily reply back ""It's SEA-MAN!"" and they all laugh. His sidekick is a bird named ""Swallow""; this increases the ridicule he receives from the rest of the Super Best Friends due to his catchphrase to Swallow being ""Swallow, come!"".

Seaman wears a costume consisting of light green pants, a blue shirt, green gloves, black underwear over his pants, and a gold belt. He has wavy blond hair and blond eyebrows.

Seaman has the power of flight and the ability to telepathically communicate with marine life, breathe underwater, and survive at any depth. His companion Swallow, despite being a bird, can similarly breathe underwater and survive at any depth.

The Cynics' headquarters is located at the [[Asperger's Research Center]]. They claim that the deception pervading the world was caused by, as they say, ""aliens, robots from the future, or whatever, fuck you"". The leader, and other patients, look and act similar to Morpheus and some of the various other characters from ''The Matrix'' films.

They recruit [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] into their group therapy for persons with [[Asperger Syndrome|Asperger syndrome]], only to tell him the secret of coping with the ""world of illusion"" is to drink alcohol. Most of their members were killed at Kyle's residence while fighting the fast-food corporations while being drunk.

The Cynic Leader, the one who is dressed like [[Morpheus]], from ''The Matrix'' series, is seen at first as a counselor or doctor, as he talks to [[Sharon Marsh]] about Asperger syndrome.

Security Guard,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Security_Guard,,"is an unnamed character who works as a security guard at multiple locations in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. He first appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"".

In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", he teaches the ropes to a [[Rookie Security Guard]] at the [[South Park Mall]], despite obliviously letting a terrorist proceed with his plan to unleash anthrax upon all of North America. At the end, he seems to be the only person who enjoys [[Fingerbang]]'s [[Fingerbang (Song)|music]] while they performed on a stage in the mall.

He is later hired by [[Eric Cartman]] in ""[[Cartmanland]]"" to prevent unwanted guests into his theme park, especially [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. He tells Cartman that he needs to let more people into the park in order to cover his salary and hire other employees to keep the theme park running.

The security guard has an aggressive demeanor with a tendency to threaten people and ask accusatory questions and then tell them to ""move along, sir/ma'am"" even when they may be dangerous. He also seems to pepper spray people for no reason. He seems to fear humiliation and have a deep sense of shame when he feels he has been humiliated.

The security guard has light brown hair with a receding hairline and a mustache. He wears a uniform made up of alight blue shirt and dark blue pants. A black belt and black shoes.

The security guard is seen working as security for the gated community the [[Black Residence]] is in and fought by the [[The New Kid|Douchebag]] in a mandatory quest. The player must first acquire a gas mask from [[Jimbo's Guns]] to become immune to the security guard's pepper spray, thus forcing a battle. After he is defeated, he tells the New Kid that he cannot look at him without feelings of deep personal shame and plays no further role in the story.

In the sequel to the ''Stick of Truth'', the security guard is still working as a security guard for the Black Residence, this time along with two other unnamed security guards and four different guard dogs. [[The New Kid|Butthole]] must fight him in order to gain entry into the Black Residence and arrest [[Steve Black]] who [[Sergeant Yates]] claims is a drug kingpin. When approached, the security guard will reveal himself from behind a bush and yell that he will ""not be humiliated again!"" and he will ""fuck up"" Butthole ""non-lethally.""

In an attempt to prevent this, he returns to [[Mr. Mackey's Childhood Residence|his childhood residence]] and hacks the NORAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, spamming the message ""The Russians are nuking us"" onto the operations board and raising the US threat level to DEFCON-3.

Sharon Marsh,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Sharon_Marsh,,"(née '''Kimble''') is [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Shelley Marsh]]'s mother, as well as [[Randy Marsh]]'s wife. She first appeared in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"".

In ""[[Spookyfish]]"" she hides all the people (including [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and her [[Flo Kimble|aunt Flo]]) killed by Stan's fish in her garden so as not to have [[Stan Marsh|her son]]<nowiki/> taken to jail (believing it was him).
*'''False Imprisonment:''' In ""[[Spookyfish]]"" she holds [[Officer Barbrady]] captive in her basement after he learns about the dead bodies.
*'''Arson:''' In ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"", she burns down a Wall-Mart and Jim's Drugs.

</gallery>

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', it is revealed that Sharon is the receptionist at [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]].

Sharon was portrayed in earlier seasons as a loving but stern suburban mother. She wanted to protect Stan from the 'dirty' language and vulgar humor of his favorite cartoon, ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]'', in ""[[Death]]"" and ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. In ""[[Spookyfish]]"", she was so protective that she buried the bodies of people she thought Stan had killed, in order to prevent Stan from being charged with murder. In actuality, it was his new pet [[Spookyfish (Character)|goldfish]] that murdered the people, to which Sharon felt regretful for not realizing in the first place. She was also unofficially in charge of the movement against [[Chinpokomon Dolls|Chinpokomon dolls]] in ""[[Chinpokomon]]"". However, she has often been caught up in fads around town, such as holistic medicine in ""[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]"" and atheism in ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"".

During the episodes in which she was voiced by [[April Stewart]], Sharon had become the sane half of her marriage. She serves as a foil to the craziness that surrounds her; craziness is often caused by her husband, Randy. In ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", she was embarrassed by Randy getting drunk and starting fights at Stan's little league games. This was lost on Randy, who imagined her cheering him on in his big fight against the Bat Dad. In ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", she is noticeably upset and disappointed in the car ride home after Randy says the N-word on ''Wheel Of Fortune''. In the [[Pandemic]] [[Pandemic 2: The Startling|story arc]], she gets repeatedly angry at Randy for videotaping the guinea pig attacks.

Sharon is named after [[Trey Parker]]'s mother, Sharon Parker. Sharon was referred to her as ""Carol"" in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Death]]"", however, many characters had different names when they were first introduced. Sharon Parker, unlike Mrs. Marsh, is an insurance broker while Mrs. Parker is an insurance saleswoman.

In the episode ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", she reveals she has been unhappy with her marriage and could not fake it anymore, claiming her life feels like the same ridiculous shit every week, and as a result divorces her husband and moves with her son and daughter to a new home while Randy moves away from himself.

[[File:Sharon-nightgown.jpg|right|thumb|Sharon in her nightgown.]]
Sharon's outfit slightly resembles that of Stan's, except with a few slight variations. She wears a brown sweater with red frilly ruffles on the cuffs and the collar, and dark blue jeans. Her hair is brown and seems to be slightly wavy. In early seasons, she is seen with brown eyebrows rarely. At night, she wears a creamy-white, knee-length nightgown with pink lining at the hem and neck, and two orange-yellow flowers embroidered on the chest. As seen in ""[[Stanley's Cup]]"", Sharon had a much longer hair during Stan's early childhood.

Some characters find her attractive, especially for her cleavage. This is first made evident in ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"". Butters, asked by the boys to provide a semen sample for a case, is unable to produce one throughout the episode. At the end of the episode, he was finally able to produce one after he imagined Sharon's breasts. Later, in ""[[Pre-School]]"", [[The 6th Graders]] agree to protect the boys from [[Trent Boyett]] in exchange for a photo of Sharon's breasts, telling Stan, ""Your mom has the hottest boobs!"" Because of the way women in ''South Park'' were traditionally animated at the series' start, Sharon's breasts or cleavage cannot be seen by the audience unless she is in nothing but a brassiere or a swimsuit.

[[File:Screenshot-by-nimbus.png|thumb|left|Sharon in her formal brown dress]]
For special occasions, she wears a brown dress with red trimming on top or a black dress, a pearl necklace, and gold earrings.

It is heavily implied in many scenes in the Marsh family's living room that Sharon is farsighted, as whenever she is reading or doing finances, she is seen wearing reading glasses.

In ""[[Whale Whores]]"", Sharon can be seen wearing a blue bathing suit at the Denver Aquarium. It is unknown if the suit is a one or two-piece suit, as it is hidden by a life vest.

In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", when Randy leaves to be in a boy band, he says bye to a girl, presumably his girlfriend, who looks incredibly like a younger Sharon with longer hair.

[[Future Stan]], in the episode ""[[My Future Self n' Me]]"", mentions that Sharon has a scar on her left knee, which is leftover from a time when she slipped in a swimming pool.

According to [[Joe and Teresa Giudice|Teresa]] in ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", she has a large chin, however, Teresa is heavily implied to be exaggerating her claim.

[[File:Sharon_S15_E08.png|thumb|Sharon in her pink gown]]
In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", Sharon wears a pink gown in the morning when making Stan his breakfast.

In the future timeline set at the end of ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', Sharon has gained some weight, and her hair has grayed out. She wears a pink, woolly jacket over her brown sweater, dark-grey pants, white socks, and black shoes. 

Sharon appears in [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]], where she sells the player various wigs, makeup, and nose jobs. She makes no further appearances.

She can be seen again in Tom's Rhinoplasty, selling makeup, artifacts, and components.

Sharon began with a fairly minor role but became a more significant character as she started to be developed into a foil for Randy's antics. She has had a speaking role in multiple episodes in every season, as well as in [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|the movie]] and the video game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

Shauna,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Shauna,,"is a [[South Park Elementary]] student who makes her first appearance in the [[Season Nine]] episode ""[[Erection Day]]"". She also appears briefly as a background character in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode ""[[Board Girls]]"".

[[Jimmy Valmer]] arranges a date with her in hopes of getting her to have sex with him. After a brief discussion, Jimmy ruins the date by stating, ''""I am so glad you think so Shauna, because I really want to stick my penis in your vagina.""'' Shauna responds by throwing her cup of water at him, calling him a creep, and leaving the restaurant in disgust.

Shauna has long, orange hair. She wears a purple blouse with white trimming, two light cyan bows in her hair, a black skirt, and black shoes.
Shauna is shown to enjoy gossiping, although unlike [[Porsche|some girls]], she seems to know when to stop, only continuing on after being urged by [[Jimmy Valmer]]. Shauna's reaction when Jimmy said he wanted to have sex with her is typical of any girl in her age group.

Sheila Broflovski,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Sheila_Broflovski,,"is [[Kyle Broflovski]]'s mother and the adoptive mother of [[Ike Broflovski]]. She is frequently despised and insulted by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], who calls her a 'bitch' as she usually spoils his misguided fun. In fact, he has even created a song to make fun of her entitled ""[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]"". She is the central antagonist of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

In ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"", she burns down 2 stores: Wall-Mart and Jim's Drugs.
*'''Murder:''' In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', she murders Terrance and Phillip, although these deaths are reversed due to Kenny's sacrifice and Cartman's V-Chip malfunctioning.
*'''Medical terrorism:''' After Shelley comes down with chicken pox, she and the other parents expose their kids to a chicken pox-infected Kenny, since getting the disease at an older age can be deadly. Kyle later confronts his mother about this.

</gallery>

Upon hearing of anything she finds offensive, Sheila exclaims ""What, what, what!"", and often starts something up about it. Cartman once noted this happens usually once a month, demanding to know why at the exact same time of the month, she always gets irritated by something, and he always ends up getting screwed by it. Her best-known protests are probably the ones connected to the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show.

She lobbied with the other parents to have ""[[Terrance and Phillip]]"" taken off the network (much like the controversy and the protests against the TV show ''Beavis and Butthead'' who Terrance and Phillip are based on). Though it succeeded, she caused many lives to be lost when she had protesters take part in suicide attacks on the studio and a worse TV show was put on the air as a replacement. She was referred to as ""Carol"" in this episode along with [[Sharon Marsh]].

She is offended by the influence [[Terrance and Phillip]]'s antics from their film ''[[Asses of Fire]]'' had on the children, so she created ""MAC"" or ""[[Mothers Against Canada]]"" since Terrance and Phillip are Canadian. She does this forgetting that her adopted son Ike is also Canadian.

When Cartman [[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch|sings a song]] insulting her in protest, she has a V-Chip prototype installed in him to give off electric shocks whenever he swore.

Although Sheila meant well in protesting the obscenity for the children's sake, it then lead to a war between [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

She was angered at the school nativity - particularly how Kyle was playing [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]. She forced the play to adopt a non-offensive theme which everybody hated, ultimately provoking a riot in which she beat up [[Priest Maxi]] as he was restrained by [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]].

She was annoyed by the boys making fun of [[Nurse Gollum]] because she had the fictional disease ""conjoined twin myslexia"" (parasitic twin), so she taught them about the disease, but the boys started trying to split their heads open with ice picks to get supposed fetuses out (except Kyle and Kenny, who probably knew better). This resulted in an angry phone call from Sharon.

A rare instance where her protest would actually help Kyle. She attempted to protest against Cartman for leading the whole school into believing her son was responsible for 9/11. However, this topic was brushed aside in favor of who defecated in the urinal at school, which happened to be Stan.

Sheila has been in protests against the Iraq War in ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"" and various others.

[[File:46a.jpg|thumb|Sheila on [[South Park Studios]].]]
Sheila wears a midnight blue dress suit with a white shirt and a violet-red skirt underneath. She also wears beige nylons, red lipstick, and gold earrings. Her hair is long and red, much like her son Kyle's, and put up in a beehive. She is overweight and shorter than average height. She speaks with a rather broad Jersey accent. In ""[[It's a Jersey Thing]]"", Sheila reveals that her family lived in Newark, New Jersey, that Gerald impregnated her with Kyle there, and that they moved to South Park two months later. In ""[[Margaritaville]]"", she wore a brown bedsheet in the form of a toga. For special occasions, her outfit is in black and dark grey colors.

When she lived in Jersey, Sheila wore a low-cut yellow tank top with “S Woww” written in the center, grey trousers with lighter grey camo print, two white studded belts, and two necklaces, one looking very similar to the belts and one that is solid black with a white accent. She is also shown with black high heel boots with silver buckles, heavy makeup, and voluminous, teased hair pulled up in a high ponytail.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', her hair has faded with some gray highlights. She wears red framed tinted glasses.

Sheila is very protective about her family and has often led huge campaigns against beliefs and other such examples which she believes are unsafe, often going too far in her efforts and steamrolling her son in the process. She was the cause of the America-Canada War and was the leader behind ""Mothers Against Canada"" (M.A.C.). She also seems to be somewhat nosy, poking into things that are other people's business. For instance, when she found out that [[Gerald Broflovski]] and [[Stuart McCormick]] used to be friends in high school she arranged a fishing date between the two (which had bad results.) In retrospect, either the relationship between Gerald and Stuart OR the fact that the Broflovskis are from New Jersey may be non-canon, unless Stuart McCormick lived in New Jersey with Gerald prior, or Gerald and Stuart went to high school together in South Park or some other location, before Gerald moved to New Jersey and impregnated Sheila with Kyle.

She is also quite quick to anger when she is challenged, or more correctly when someone tries to tell her she is wrong. An example being that she shot Terrance and Phillip when Kyle told her she was wrong in starting a war with Canada when all he did was go see an R rated movie, in normal episodes when Kyle tries to talk back Sheila raises her voice and gives him into trouble no matter how right he might be to do so.

In the 8th draft of the script for the movie, it is clear that the power of leading M.A.C. went to her head and made her insane to the point where after discovering Ike, Cartman, and Kyle were at the USO show, General Plymkin thinks they are ""Canadian Sympathizers"" and wanted them executed alongside Terrance and Phillip and apparently she and Cartman's mom were okay with it while Stan and Kenny's mothers were shocked at this act.

After the war began she went on an insane rant about how perfect her plan is to eliminate ""not pretty things"" and among other things admitted that Kyle was not born in a hospital. That and she mistook Satan for Alan Dershowitz. This aspect of Sheila's was dropped from the main film as it seemed to be very uncharacteristic of her and to make her more sympathetic as she saw what the war lead to.

However, her over-protective and annoying personality and protests seem to have diminished a lot in recent seasons. The protests could reveal a vulnerability in Sheila in that she may have a fear of people's perception of her as a mother. She also wants to shift blame as seen in ""[[Death]]"", where she wants to protect the children or in the movie, where in one of her songs, ""[[Blame Canada]]"", she states at the end of the song: ""''We must blame them and cause a fuss/Before somebody thinks of blaming us!""''

Kyle even says that whenever he gets in trouble, instead of holding him responsible, Sheila looks for someone else to blame.

Sheila is named after Matt Stone's own mother, and Kyle's family surname is derived from Stone's mother's original maiden name, Broslovski (which was changed to ""Belasco"" when her ancestors immigrated to the United States). This may explain why the family's name was spelled in various ways early on in the series (e.g., Brosloski, Brovlofski, etc.).

Even though the entire Broflovski family practices Judaism on the show, in real life, Matt Stone's mother is the only Jew in the family (and he has mentioned that he and his sister, Rachel, were brought up agnostic). His sister is the only member of his family who is not represented on the show. This could possibly be because Stan (and in real life, Trey Parker) 
has a sister and with Matt and Trey considering themselves very similar anyway, for both Kyle and Stan to have a sister would make them far too similar.

Stone claims to have learned phrases and pet names like ""bubbe"" from his maternal grandparents, who like their daughter, were Jewish.

Sheila mentioned in ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"" that she had a sister to [[Barbra Streisand]] by asking for an autograph claiming ""her sister would die"". This mysterious sister of Sheila's, however, is unnamed and has not made any known appearances.

Sheila makes a brief appearance in the minigame called ''Avalanche''.

Sheila appears in South Park Rally as unlockable character. But, Like [[Scuzzlebutt]] and [[Liane Cartman|Liane]], Sheila is not available for Nintendo 64. In Easter Egg Hunt Race, You have to catch the Pot Pie (Golden Cow in PlayStation Version), Located near the [[Hells Pass Hospital]].

Sheila Broflovski appears in the game as a minor character, remaining inside the [[Community Center]] during the entire game.

Sheila can be found at her home in the game. She plays a role as a boss in the mission ""[[Alternate Universes Collide Again]]"" when [[Kyle Schwartz]] calls her after being beaten up by The New Kid. She comes out furiously and decides to attack The New Kid and his selected allies. She can be taken a selfie with after The New Kid successful wins the match. She can also be seen at [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]] eating with her family in the expansion pack ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'' and can be selfied with without requirement.
Sheila had a fairly major role in the series early on, but her prominence quickly decreased after [[Mary Kay Bergman|Mary Kay]]'s death and the increasing use of Stan's father [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] as the main parent in place of [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s mother. She has had a speaking role in every season to date, as well as a major role in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' and a minor appearance in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

Shub-Niggurath,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Shub-Niggurath,,"is an Elder God. She made her first appearance in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]],'' and a cameo in the ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"".

Shub-Niggurath is an Outer God in the Mythos and an incredible fertility deity, with the ability to give life, and take it with little effort.

In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' she is an Elder God who resides in the basement of [[Park County Police Station]], being worshiped by the cops. Due to the fact she apparently craves ""dark meat,"" the police falsely arrest black citizens across town and feed them to her.

Shub-Niggurath appears as the final boss in the police station, and is destroyed by the temporary alliance formed by Coon and Friends and Freedom Pals.

Like many Elder Gods, Shub-Niggurath is a morbid combination of tentacles and giant mouths.

Despite the complete greatness of her tentacles, she is in possession of a gigantic one, used to deliver powerful hits to the enemies, the ones who are hit will have no chance of survival. Similarly, among her mouths, there is a giant one located in the upper body, with knife-like teeth to chomp. She also has a smaller exit below for ovulating and regurgitating devoured allies. Blinking yellow dots can be seen scattered across her body, likely serving as light receptors, therefore her eyes.

Shub-Niggurath is a goddess with powers and motivation beyond imagination, any possible way of attack will result in complete devastation and any attack against will be proven futile, the only way to defeat her is through feeding ""White meat"" to her.

Due to being a fertility goddess, she is able to continuously ovulate and plant eggs onto the battlefield, which will explode on those surrounding it upon taking damage.

As revealed in the process of combat, Shub-Niggurath has two phases: Enraged and Dormant.

Shub-Niggurath is fought at the end of the Police Station during [[The Thin White Line]]. As an Elder God (or goddess), she is tremendously powerful, being completely immune to any of New Kid's attacks and armed with ''two'' instant-kill moves. However, her dietary habits can be used against her; when she uses her Devour move to catch a victim, she can be healed or harmed depending on the quality of the flesh.
After consuming white meat (including at the start of the battle, thanks to CLASSi), Shub-Niggurath will burst out of her pit in a blind fury. At this point, she will begin readying a real-time attack; a lethal tentacle slam that hits the four columns nearest to her.

The objective of this phase is to get as many heroes as you can to the two leftmost columns of the battlefield before Shub-Niggurath's attack meter fills up; when it does, the All-Mother will interrupt the current turn to inflict a knockout blow on anyone in range. The cultists will attempt to block New Kid's path, using the occasional knockback move to force them closer to their goddess.

The battle shifts to Phase 2 once Shub-Niggurath's meter is full.

After smashing the battlefield with her mighty tentacle, Shub-Niggurath will spit out two pulsating eggs from one of her mouths (as well as any heroes that she devoured in her previous Dormant phase). The eggs will land on random squares near the middle of the battlefield; they have 1 HP and no attacks on their own, but they also explode when damaged, knocking back anyone directly adjacent to them. After ""ovulating"", the Black Goat of the Woods will retreat into her pit, with only several tentacles being visible.

In this phase, Shub-Niggurath's only move is Devour, a telegraphed attack that covers the two rightmost columns of the battlefield. Any humans in the danger zone will be consumed on the boss's turn, healing or harming her depending on their size and race.

After catching someone with Devour, Shub-Niggurath will re-emerge as more cultists arrive to force the team towards her (including Sergeant Yates, the first time this happens). From here, the battle returns to Phase 1, looping until either New Kid or the boss are defeated.

Shelley Marsh,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Shelley_Marsh,,"is [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] and [[Sharon Marsh]]'s daughter and [[Stan Marsh]]'s older sister. She is ill-tempered and aggressive, referring to those around her as ""turds"" and often beating or even torturing Stan when adults are not around, though nonetheless compassionate; later seasons have instead emphasized her as assertive and focused more on her relationship with her father.

She has been voiced at different times by [[Mary Kay Bergman]], [[Eliza Schneider]], and currently [[April Stewart]]. She first appeared in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"".

In some episodes, Shelley can be seen beating up Stan and other characters.
*'''Breaking and Entering/Vandalism:''' She enters Skyler's house and destroys his guitar in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"".
*'''Arson:''' In ""[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]"", Shelley is seen burning down a [[Blockbuster]] store that Randy buys.
*'''Drugging Others:''' In ""[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]"", Shelley, being fed up with Randy's new cannabis business, attempts to sabotage his freshly grown ""Halloween Special"" strain by throwing a homemade chemical concoction in an attempt to sabotage it. This actually enhanced it, but in the process tainted it and caused Randy and Towelie to have nightmarish hallucinations and possibly inadvertently led to Randy being sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein.
*'''Implied Sexual Assault by Proxy:''' In ""[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]"", Shelley, being fed up with Randy's new cannabis business, attempts to sabotage his freshly grown ""Halloween Special"" strain by throwing a homemade chemical concoction in an attempt to sabotage it. This actually enhanced it but in the process tainted it and caused Randy and Towеlie to have nightmarish hallucinations and possibly inadvertently led to Randy being sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. As Shelley caused the hallucinations and made Randy incapable of properly being able to defend himself while in a hallucination-fueled daze, she is inadvertently responsible for her father's implied sexual assault.

At the time of her introduction in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", it is established that Shelley has been physically harming Stan for sometime and that the other boys are already aware of it, questioning if she caused his black eye. Stan insists that she has been beating him up because she recently received orthodontal headgear at the dentist and is taking her anger out on him, and throughout the episode she questions if he is staring at her headgear or her neck brace, accusing him of lying when he denies this and using it as a pretext to attack him. These attacks including elaborate setups such as throwing him through a window and trying to use a lawnmower on him. Stan insists that their parents have not listened when he has previously tried to tell them she is beating him up, and that they don't believe him. They take Shelley at her word that Stan has been with her despite being told by [[Jimbo Kern|Uncle Jimbo]] and the news that Stan has been attacking the town, an act which establishes some mutual understanding between them, though she continues to attack him.

Though she retained a mean streak, she was humanized much more in future appearances. Her softer side was first seen in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"", when she babysat [[Eric Cartman]] and found some friendship with him when he helped to humiliate [[Skyler Morse]], who claimed to be her boyfriend despite being an adult. She was willing to compromise with the kids in exchange for a favor in ""[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]"", requesting tampons in exchange for the television. She offered to help the boys in ""[[Pre-School]]"" if they made amends for having hurt their own teacher, though she reinforced her intimidation towards the boys.

Though the Marsh family saw increasing use in later season, this did not initially include Shelley, many episodes that feature her brother and parents prominently continued to exclude her. In ""[[Over Logging]]"", she whacked Stan a few times in front of her parents but received no punishment. In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", she is not seen at her brother's birthday party and only briefly appears at the end, looking sad as her mother packs after she divorces Randy, and her own reaction is not explored further. 

After season 15's ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"", however, her role began to gradually expand, with her receiving significant roles alongside her family, often acting as a further foil to Randy like her mother and brother, with next to no antagonism between her and her brother. She helped burn down her father's [[Blockbuster]] in ""[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]"", became a fan of [[Lorde]]'s music in [[Season Eighteen]], and accused her mother of favoring Stan in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"". 

She was found trying to vape in ""[[Tegridy Farms]]"", inspiring her father to move to start a marijuana farm, and she has consistently and vocally opposed the business, which Randy has taken to describing as her having a ""marijuana problem"". The ""[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]"" focuses on this relationship in particular, revealing Shelley likes to attend the school book fair and enjoys reading.

Shelley has been shown with a number of interests over the course of the show. Her favorite television series include ''Friends'' which she watches with Skyler in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"", ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' which she was watching in ""[[Pre-School]]"" and most famously, she's a big fan of [[Russell Crowe Fightin' Around The World]] as mentioned in ""[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]"", proclaiming the only thing she loves more than Crowe's show is seeing Stan suffer. Her favorite music includes [[Britney Spears]] music, mentioned in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' as well as [[Lorde]], who is shown to be one of her heroes in ""[[#REHASH]]"". She enjoys reading, as she mentions throughout ""[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]"". She also seems to enjoy playing the ''Settlers of Catan'' on Xbox, which she used as a bonding activity with [[Larry Feegan]]. Besides these electronic pastimes, she is also mentioned to be a Girl Scout Den Leader in ""[[Royal Pudding]]"".

There are a number of posters seen in her room which may indicate other interests, although they are not mentioned in dialogue. These include a poster with horses, suggesting she has some interest in them, and a ''Sadie Dakota'' poster, in parody of Hannah Montana. She can be seen with a ''Frozen'' poster in ""[[The Cissy]]"" and a ''Uniters of the Universe'' (a parody of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'') can also be seen.

Shelley has also been shown to be exceptionally strong, even relative to her age, throughout many episodes. In ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", she was able to subdue Stan's mutant clone, which was wreaking havoc upon the town and lifting full-grown adults. In ""[[Chickenpox]]"", Shelley, despite being in the hospital with chickenpox, manages to beat up Stan and flip him into objects, which [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] pays no attention to. She was even able to pick up an entire piano in ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"" and drop it on Stan and Kyle.   In ""[[Pre-School]]"", when the boys turned to her as a last resort when [[The 6th Graders|the sixth graders]] could not stop [[Trent Boyett]], which could likely imply that Shelley alone is stronger than all of the sixth graders combined.

She can play the piano relatively well, a seen by her performance of ""[[I Saw Three Ships]]"" in ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"". She can also sing, though not as well, as illustrated by ""[[Turds!]]"" in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"".

Shelley wears a gray shirt and pink pants. She has shoulder-length, messy brown hair with bangs. She has bad dental problems and has to wear orthodontic headgear, giving her a very unappealing appearance. Because of that, she is usually scowling or frowning and rarely smiles. She has a distinct adenoidal, somewhat masculine, slurred voice, where she breathes heavily through her mouth and nose and has a lisp. On some occasions, she has been seen with her pajamas on; her pajama shirt is dark pink and her pants are light pink. On special occasions, she wears a pink dress. At funerals, she wears a variation of the pink dress, but it is black and dark red. She is one of the few characters older than the fifth grade who lacks a nose and is considerably shorter than other teenage characters.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', she no longer wears braces or has headgear. She has long hair and thin brown eyebrows. She wears a light olive green jacket over her gray shirt, a pink skirt, gray stockings, black shoes, a rowed necklace with rubies, and gold emerald earrings. She still has a similar voice as an adult.

Shelley is often defined by her anger and aggression towards others, which she often expresses towards her brother Stan, who she has had a contentious and difficult relationship with. Even when heartbroken over not being able to see her boyfriend in ""[[Over Logging]]"" when Stan tries to comfort her, she nonetheless attacks him to express her feelings. Though his friends do not tend to take Stan very seriously when he discusses Shelley's behavior, they nonetheless appear intimidated by her as well. Her aggression seems to be rooted in an insecurity based on her looks, as mentioned by her brother in her debut, when he suggests she has been beating her up because she had been given new orthodontal headgear, and she admits in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"" that nobody had ever liked her before and that nobody would go out with her because she was ""ugly"". She accuses Stan more than once of staring at her braces and accuses him of lying when he denies it, further suggesting serious insecurity. She has also exhibited jealousy of [[Sharon Marsh|her mother's]] relationship with her brother, accusing her of ""always taking Stan's side"", though Stan has conversely claimed they believe she is ""innocent and sweet"", suggesting they both feel competitive towards their parents' feelings.

Shelley has often expressed open belief that most other individuals are dumb or stupid, often referring to them as ""turds"" and in ""[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]"" expressing concern that marijuana is making others dumber than they already are. However, Shelley is also shown to be compassionate, and is willing to protect her little brother from threats besides herself, most prominently in the episode ""[[Pre-School]]"" where Shelley vows to protect her little brother and his friends from being harmed by Trent Boyett because killing him is her job, but conditions her protection that they come out confess the truth about what happened, and emphasizing their responsibility for their actions. This suggests she shares her mother and brother's sense of morality.

Shelley notably is less complacent to inconvenience and obstacles than those around her and not afraid to take matters into her own hands when necessary. She burns down the [[Blockbuster]] when her father begins to exhibit more unhinged behavior such as taking away their phones, she is willing to interfere with her father's marijuana when he continues to neglect the family, and when Skyler breaks up with her she takes joy in executing a revenge plan against him. She does not turn to her parents or authority figures in challenging situations and is more than willing to handle them herself. She was also unafraid to call out [[Mr. Feegan]] and [[Mrs. Feegan]] for how they treated their son.

Stan is Shelley's younger brother, and they have a difficult relationship throughout the series, with a history of Shelley using intimidation and violence towards him. These actions have extended not only to Stan but also his friends when they were present or participating in the same antics. For instance, in ""[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]"", she smashed both [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and Stan over the head with a piano. Even when Stan was sympathetic towards her when she became upset, she and her online boyfriend were no longer in contact, she nonetheless continued trying to punch him repeatedly in ""[[Over Logging]]"". This is the only instance in which her violence towards Stan is noticed by their parents, as Randy then runs over and tells Shelley to calm down. When he asked her about a television show she liked, [[Russell Crowe]], she also compared it as not as interesting as torturing Stan.

Both children seem to view each other as rivals for their parents' affections. Stan has often claimed his parents favor Shelley over him and that they do not listen when he tries to discuss the violence she inflicts upon him, saying they see Shelley as ""innocent""; however, in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", Shelley threatens to shoot Stan, claiming that Sharon takes his side all the time and blaming him for feeling disregarded by their family. After that, they all agreed that they needed to learn to be better to each other. In recent seasons they have both expressed a similar distaste towards their father, even bonding with their mother over it in ""[[Season Finale]]"".

Despite this, when Stan is threatened by outside forces, such as possibly being sent away to military school or bullies like Trent Boyett, Shelley has shown compassion for him and stood up for him, remarking that making him suffer is her job. Most notably after the rampage of the evil mutant clone Stan in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", when Stan began to cry about not wanting to go away and leave home, Shelley promised her parents that she had been watching him the entire time and not done anything wrong, and they believed her. She also was willing to help protect the boys from Trent Boyett if they apologized to [[Miss Claridge]] and took responsibility, with her demands not benefiting herself.

Randy is Shelley's father, and they have a strained relationship characterized by a mutual lack of understanding.

Sharon, Stan and Shelley are often unified in expressing their frustration and disgust with Randy's various fixations. For example, she was frustrated by Randy [[Pandemic|recording ridiculously everyday family antics]], saying ""Turn it off, Dad!"".

Randy has been shown to love her very much, as seen most prominently in ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"" where he becomes obsessed with Broadway and musical theatre, which can influence women to give their partners oral sex after attendance, and is horrified when he finds out Shelley is heading to the theatre with her new boyfriend, [[Larry Feegan]]. Randy goes to lengths to try to save her from this influence, accidentally leading to Larry's death, telling Shelley later he loves her.

Shelley expresses anger that her father doesn't even try to get to know her in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"". Randy responds by saying that he really wants to but he feels like she hates him.

Their relationship becomes even more strained after Randy moves his family to [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] as Shelley does not want to move and hates marijuana, which creates further distance between them and angers Randy to the point he has her locked up in jail when he tells the police about her having a ""marijuana problem"" and he feels no remorse over it.

In ""[[Season Finale]]"" Shelley was very happy when she found out Randy went to jail and hoped he could never get out. When Randy thanks his family for their ""support,"" he only mentions Sharon and Stan and completely ignores Shelley, who is clearly upset.

Sharon is Shelley's mother. Their relationship has not been explored much, but they seem closer than she is with her father. In ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", they both seem to take delight in queefing in Stan and Randy's presence and later seem disappointed when they cannot continue the joke. 

In contrast, ""[[Over Logging]]"", Shelley was upset over Sharon telling her to get off the Internet and go to bed, yelling ""WHY DO YOU HATE ME?!"" at her, and in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", she accuses Sharon at gunpoint of favoring Stan, claiming she always takes his side and that she acts like Stan can't do anything wrong.

In the first timeline depicted in ""[[South Park: Post Covid]]"" and ""[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]"", Shelley is killed accidentally and Sharon is seen inconsolably depressed at her funeral, and is later said to have committed suicide as a result of her death. Though these events are erased from the timeline, it suggests that Sharon's love for Shelley is especially deep.

Marvin is Shelley's paternal grandfather. She seems to care for him as she became angry when Stan was trying to help Grandpa kill himself. Marvin also seems to love her as well since he wanted to spend a great amount of money to buy her expensive jewelry. However, in ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", she aimed her gun at Marvin when Randy says to take care of him, assuming he was suggesting she kill him.

She was Shelley's maternal great-aunt. Aunt Flo gave Shelley a television/CD player/surround sound home theater, which Shelley thanked her for before she was killed by the evil goldfish she gave Stan.

He is Shelley's maternal uncle. They have never interacted onscreen.

Shelley is rarely seen with any friends, and in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"" she claimed that nobody at school liked her, suggesting she was too ugly. She can be heard in the same episode talking to an unseen friend named Carrie on the phone, however, and in ""[[REHASH|#REHASH]]"", she asks to go to the ""Women of Rock"" concert with her friends [[Kelly and Stacy]], and they are briefly seen in the crowd attending together.

[[File:Skylar.jpg|thumb|Skyler was Shelley's boyfriend in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"".]]
No boys liked Shelley at school, which led her into a relationship with a twenty-two-year-old wannabe musician, [[Skyler Morse]], who pretended to like her so that he could have sex with her, justifying his pedophilic behavior as being an ""immature twenty-two-year-old"". 
Though Shelley initially seemed comfortable with him, writing music with his friends and making out with him at the [[Cartman Residence]] when she was babysitting, his predatory behavior became more obvious in his continuous requests for her to have sex, he broke up with her when she refused in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"". She admitted that she only dated him because he was one of the only people who liked her and seemed to be nice to her, and was depressed, but she found some friendship in [[Eric Cartman]] as they teamed up to get revenge on Skyler.

[[File:Wildwildwestrap1.jpg|thumb|Cartman and Shelley in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"".]]
Shelley and Cartman first interacted briefly in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"" when Cartman repeatedly bragged that he would stand up to a woman who threatened him, only to immediately quiet down when Shelley overheard him insult her.

In ""[[Cat Orgy]]"", Shelley was assigned to babysit [[Eric Cartman]] by his mother while she attended a party, and was initially dismissive towards him. When Skyler broke up with her and she began crying on the couch, Cartman helped her realize that she did not need him and that he was a jerk. The two had been enemies, but soon became friends after getting revenge on Skyler, though when [[Liane Cartman]] arrived home they tried to blame each other for the cat's misbehavior.

However, in subsequent appearances, their mutual understanding appears to have deteriorated, and Shelley treats him just as she treats any of Stan's other friends, referring to him as a ""fat turd"". Cartman tries to manipulate her by claiming he thinks she is attractive in ""[[Pre-School]]"" which fails to impress her.

[[File:OverLogging24.jpg|thumb|Amir and Shelley finally meet.]]
In the [[Season Twelve]] episode, ""[[Over Logging]]"", Shelley has an boyfriend over the internet for some time, Amir, who lives in Montana. She believes that the emotions between herself and [[Amir]] are real and is upset when her parents interrupt their chatting, and heartbroken at the prospect of not seeing each other again when the internet is down. They run into each other in person at the [[Internet Refugee Camp]], having both traveled to California so they could resume chatting online, showing they both care for each other, and promising to e-mail each other that night. She is overjoyed they can chat again.

Given her subsequent involvement with [[Larry Feegan]], it can be assumed this relationship ended.

[[File:Settlers of Catan.jpg|thumb|Larry and Shelley playing together in ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"".]]
In ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"", a child Shelley's age named [[Larry Feegan]] appears, who is shown to be spineless and cowardly. When he tries to use the diving board at swimming, Shelley intervenes to try to get him off the board. [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] and Sharon arrange a vacation to New York, Larry's vegan family agrees to take in Stan and Shelley for a while, but Shelley stands up to them on Larry's behalf pointing out they haven't asked his opinion. Larry is appreciative and brings her a flower. They begin to spend a lot of time together, playing ''Settlers of Catan'' and eventually going to see the play ''Wicked'' together. However, Randy, knowing that Shelley will end up giving Larry a blowjob if they go to see the play, breaks in and floods the performance. Larry Feegan is killed in the resulting chaos, leaving Shelley heartbroken.

Shelley is a playable character in multiplayer mode. However, she is only available on PC, in addition to [[Satan]], [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], and [[Santa Claus|Santa]].

Shelley appears in ''South Park Rally'' as an unlockable character. To unlock her, players must win Valentine's Day Race without being attacked by an arrow. In the Nintendo 64 version, players must find the three golden cows in the said level.

Shelley is seen as an enemy in her room. When [[The New Kid]] first goes into her room without Stan as a buddy, she threatens New Kid and sends him out of her room without initiating a battle. When New Kid goes with Stan, who warns of a mighty ""She-Ogre"", she can be battled. After she is defeated, she befriends New Kid, stating that at least he does not fight like a girl. Kenny's Charm ability works on her despite her gender and summons can be used in her battle.

Shelley can be seen at the [[Marsh Residence]]. She is found in the living room, laid on the sofa, using her phone. The player can take a selfie with her, however, she will only agree to do so at Level 7 Influencer.

When the boys asked about whether or not the handicapped would go to hell if they were incapable of confessing their sins, [[Priest Maxi]] told them that yes they would. Sister Anne was shocked and horrified by this, adamantly disagreeing with him--Sister Anne felt that as long as you're a good person in the long run, you should be able to get into heaven no matter who you are or what you're beliefs are.

She and the parents attempt to use bribery to convince the kids to go back to their normal lives, but Cartman saw through the ruse from the start. Finally, Sister Anne attempted to talk to Cartman seriously about his insane church ideals, and asked that he allow the other kids to go back to school and let them be kids again.

Skeeter,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Skeeter,,"is the current owner and bartender of [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails|Skeeter's Wine Bar]] and a prominent townsperson. He made his first cameo appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", but his first prominent appearance was in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"". He is often seen at his bar or leading protests.

He is often portrayed as a stereotypical redneck with a strong southern accent, and often spouses conservative activist political viewpoints, such as supporting the War in Iraq and speaking out against homosexuality, though his viewpoints may vary based on the episode.

Skeeter was first introduced in ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"" as a patron at the then-unnamed town Bar. He and [[Skeeter's Friends|his two friends]] were depicted harassing customers with Skeeter's catchphrase, ""we don't take kindly to (group of people) around here"", which continues to occasionally be used. He would reappear at the bar in ""[[Cripple Fight]]"".

The episode ""[[Free Hat]]"" would establish his secondary usage as a regular leader of mobs and protests, when he would help the boys by leading the 'free [[Hat McCullough]]' movement, and Skeeter would continue to play this role, most notably in ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"", where he supports the Iraq War and sings against [[Randy Marsh|Randy]], who is against the war, and later in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"" as one of many anti-gay activists in Denver, as well as parts of larger protests in episodes such as ""[[Goobacks]]"" and ""[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]"".

Skeeter was revealed to serve on the [[City Council]] in ""[[Die Hippie, Die]]"" and reappeared with them in ""[[Night of the Living Homeless]]"". He is first seen as one of [[Randy Marsh]]'s friends and regular drinking buddies in [[Season Eleven]]'s ""[[More Crap]]"".

Skeeter was seen in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, ""[[Margaritaville]]"" as a member of economic council in the [[Community Center]], and in the same season, the previously unnamed bar was renamed to [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails]], though it would be several years until it would be [[South Park: The Stick of Truth|confirmed]] that Skeeter had indeed become the bar's new owner, and it was also revealed he was taking anger management classes. He speaks with a strong Southern accent.

He was reduced to cameo appearances for six seasons, until [[Season Nineteen]], when his business became one of many sweeped up in the changes in the town. He appears to have a friendship with [[Tuong Lu Kim]], who praises Skeeter's Bar in a promotional video and is eager to tell him about the defeat of restaurant reviewers. Skeeter made multiple short appearances tending to a re-designed bar afterwards.

Skeeter wears a magenta coat with two cyan pockets and buttons, a brown belt with a gray buckle, black pants and black shoes. He has curly red hair, large ears, small eyebrows and a double chin.

Skeeter has an abrasive, short-tempered personality and is often depicted as crude and socially ignorant. He often reacts to changes in the town with concern and an expectation of negative effects on him or other townsfolk. He often projects a very masculine and aggressive image but many of his reactions seem to stem from fears of negative repercussions. In his spare time he seems to enjoy stereotypical redneck hobbies like watching Cock Magic, or drinking, and in recent episodes, has exhibited a genuine knowledge of alcohol and tending his bar.

Skeeter, along with [[Darryl Weathers]], seem to be among the leaders of the town's rednecks and conservatives, and often lead their protests against local issues, such as fighting to free Hat McCullough. In many earlier episodes, such as ""[[Cripple Fight]]"" and ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", Skeeter was depicted as one of the town's more homophobic residents, exhibiting concern about [[Big Gay Al]] and gay marriage, but his views on the issue appear to have relaxes as of ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"". Despite his conservative views often aligning against the federal government, he is a member of the City Council and therefore an important member of the town's own local government.

He has frequently been seen at the town Bar since his first speaking appearance, often accompanied by two other redneck friends in older episodes, where he often proclaims ""we don't take kindly to (group of people) around here"", to which the blonde bartender often relaxed his concerns by assuring him nobody was being hurt. Since [[Season Nineteen]], Skeeter has worked the tap at his own bar and has been depicted fulfilling orders and been less abrasive and conservative, though he still uses his catchphrase on occasion.

Skeeter appears in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' as a quest giver. In the game, it is fully confirmed that he owns the bar now, and he gives the player a quest to kill the rats in the cellar because of health code violations. Despite being labeled a merchant, he does not sell anything. He also states that he doesn't take kindly to children except for the player.

They are on the hillbilly side of town and were often seen with Skeeter until ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"". A prototype version of them is seen in [[Chef]]'s band in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"".

They made their first appearance in ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"" where they, along with [[Skeeter]], kick [[Peetie the Sexual Harassment Panda]] and [[The Boys]] out of the [[Skeeter's Wine Bar|bar]] after claiming they don't take people like them kindly there.

In ""[[Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus]]"", one of them is seen on the TV news giving stating that Jesus should do something on New Year's Eve.

They then began making background appearances until [[Season Five]], where they began to make more significant appearances, such as in ""[[Free Hat]]"", where they, along with Skeeter, attempt to free [[Hat McCullough]], and ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"". "", in which they side with the people in favor of war.

Their last appearance as a pair was in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", where they watch [[Mr. Garrison]]'s Speech. The two remained absent from the show until ""[[W.T.F.]]"", where one of them is seen watching the Wrestling Federation of Boys with the other rednecks.

Skyler Morse,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Skyler_Morse,,"is a 22-year-old musician who, due to low grades, is still in high school. He first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[Cat Orgy]]"".

In ""[[Cat Orgy]]"" Skyler starts a relationship with Shelly Marsh and starts pressuring her into underage sex (albeit subtly), which Shelly declines. This relationship is considered inappropriate as Shelly is under the minimum age of consent in Colorado (17 years old).

Skyler makes his first appearance in which his girlfriend, [[Shelly Marsh]], is babysitting [[Eric Cartman]], and she invites Skyler over. Due to the abuse that Shelly puts him through, Cartman tries to expose Shelly as being a bad babysitter. However, each attempt fails and results in Cartman being beaten by the couple. Later, Shelly allows Cartman to watch the meteor shower with her and Skyler, who tries to push Shelly into having sex with him. Shelly refuses, causing Skyler to become furious and to dump her immediately while claiming he has other girlfriends who would put out for him. Showing concern for a heartbroken Shelly, Cartman helps her get revenge on Skyler, by distracting him, allowing Shelly to destroy his guitar, put it in a litter box with a message calling him the ""King of Turds"", written in cat poop. Infuriated, Skyler goes back to [[Cartman Residence|Cartman's house]] with the intent of attacking Cartman and Shelly. However, Cartman's cat, [[Mr. Kitty]], was having an orgy, and Cartman throws catnip at Skyler making all the aroused cats jump upon him and attack him, even taking off his underwear in the process and biting off his penis.

Skyler makes another appearance, a [[Season Four|season]] later, in ""[[Timmy 2000]]"", where he is seen playing a prominent role. [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] randomly meets up with Skyler and his band, [[The Lords of the Underworld]], in his garage. Hearing him scream his catchphrase ""Tim-ah!"", Skyler asks Timmy to join his band and so that they can win the battle of the bands. Skyler's band wins, allowing them to open for [[Phil Collins]] at [[Lalapalalapaza]]. Phil Collins, however, is disgusted by the idea of Timmy being exploited and being mocked. He makes Skyler become jealous of Timmy by telling him that Timmy is stealing the limelight from him. Skyler quits his band, causing it to disband, and Collins allows him to perform in his own solo band, called [[Reach for the Skyler]], at [[Lalapalalapaza]]. During Lalapalalapaza, Phil Collins is booed off stage, because no one really likes his music or his attitude towards Timmy. Feeling guilty because of his earlier decision to quit his band, Skyler returns to the band and apologizes to Timmy. They agree to take him back and perform on stage at the audience's request.

He makes a brief cameo appearance in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"" in the crowd of striking musicians.


Skyler has long dark brown curly hair and large brown eyebrows, he has two warts on his cheeks. Skyler wears a blue cap with a black border, a gray shirt under a black jacket with the sleeves up, a darker gray belt with a lighter gray buckle, light blue pants, and red shoes. He initially has a brown acoustic guitar in ""[[Cat Orgy]]"", but in ""[[Timmy 2000]]"", he uses a white electric guitar.

Skyler is extremely self-centered and only cares about his guitar in the episode ""[[Cat Orgy]]"". This is again demonstrated in ""[[Timmy 2000]]"" in which he bullies his friends [[Jonesy]] and [[Mark (The Lords of the Underworld)|Mark]] into continuing with a band that has repeatedly failed. However, he later comes off as somewhat nicer when he demonstrates concern about his band and feels guilty for being a jerk after quitting the band when he doesn't receive primary attention. Skyler's romantic or rather sexual feelings towards Shelly demonstrates that he is technically a hebephile due to the sexual maturity difference between them, as Shelly is an early pubescent child and Skyler is a post-pubescent young adult.

On the night that [[Jesus Christ]] was slated to die by crucifixion, he selected one of his followers to be the new leader of his church. Knowing that one man could never be the voice of faith due to how easily they could be corrupted, he instead selected his most trusted and pure disciple. That disciple was a rabbit named Peter, who became the first Pope. However, as the years passed, the rabbit Peter was replaced by a human Pope, and the Catholic Church destroyed all evidence of a non-human pope, viewing it as a blasphemy. Also, Leonardo da Vinci originally meant to draw Peter's true form in his painting The Last Supper but was forced to draw him as a human by the Church. Fortunately, he drew Peter's true form behind the drawing he was forced to do and left other clues, that way with advanced technology, the original painting can be seen.

Peter went on to have children, all of whom were protected by the mysterious [[Hare Club for Men]], with Snowball being the most recent of descendants. However, when [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and [[Bill Donohue]] teamed up to destroy the Hare Club and end Peter Rabbit's bloodline once and for all, it came to [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]] to protect Snowball. Stan chose to save his father over Snowball and gave the rabbit over to Donohue, under the requirement that no one would be hurt. They were, however, double-crossed. Jesus, however, managed to arrive and save Snowball from being cooked into a cannibalistic human/rabbit stew.

After Jesus killed Donohue, Snowball officially succeeded Benedict XVI as Supreme Pontiff and Bishop of Rome. Snowball became the first pope in several centuries to use his birth name as his papal name. When asked by the College of Cardinals what to tell the people on how to live their lives, Snowball remained silent, as Jesus intended.

Pope Snowball is a white rabbit. Upon assuming the papacy, he began wearing the ''mitra preciosa ''(miter), the white and gold, ruby-studded papal hat.

Somali Pirates,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Somali_Pirates,,"were a group of pirates based in [[Somalia]]. They appeared in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode ""[[Fatbeard]]"".

[[Eric Cartman]] envisions a dream life of a pirate, and leads a small crew (consisting of [[Kevin Stoley]], [[Ike Broflovski]], [[Clyde Donovan]] and [[Butters Stotch]]) to Somalia, only to discover the living conditions of their destination upon arrival. The crew wanders into a pirate's lair, unaware of the pirates' intention to use them as hostage for a ransom.

Three pirates led the children onto a boat, and approached a French cruise ship, demanding a ransom in exchange for the safe return of the pirate crew. The ransom was eventually secured, and the pirates released the children. Cartman however, decides to take over the cruise ship, doing so successfully when Kevin arms a toy lightsaber. Cartman returns to the lair with the cruise ship, much to the shock of the pirates themselves.

Following the crew's return, Cartman berates the Somali pirates for their current state, and proposes leading the pirates and making changes to help them become ""the most feared people on Earth,"" before rallying them into singing ""[[Somalian Pirates We]]"".

When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] discovers that his brother had left with the pirate crew, he makes his way to Somalia, only to be captured by the Somali pirates, with Cartman demanding a ransom of ten million Euros for his safe return.

One of the pirates later approached Butters and Ike, asking them why they left America. Butters begins to explain how bad their lives were, citing all the homework and rules. The pirate, on the other hand, explained that he wishes he could go to school and learn about the world and that he wishes he was not a pirate.

The pirates were eventually killed by a platoon of U.S. military snipers.

Most of the Somali pirates wore ragged clothes with headbands or bandanas, carrying a rifle with them.

Some Puerto Rican Guy,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Some_Puerto_Rican_Guy,,"is an entirely fabricated criminal who is mentioned in the [[Season Five]] episode, ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"".

Some Puerto Rican guy was blamed for kidnapping and killing [[Butters Stotch]], [[JonBenét Ramsey]], [[O.J. Simpson]]'s wife, and [[Gary Condit]]'s intern. He was made the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]]'s number 1 most wanted criminal. [[Linda Stotch]] claimed him to be of average Puerto Rican height. 

Throughout the episode, it is implied that he is entirely fictional and was invented to cover up the fact that the individuals who claimed he was real were really the ones who murdered their relatives/lovers. The character is also satirical of racial stereotyping against minorities, especially in crime.

Sophie Gray,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Sophie_Gray,,"is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|female fourth-grade]] student at [[South Park Elementary]]. She first appears in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode, ""[[Basic Cable]]"". She is the new girl at school, who recently moved from Scottsdale, Arizona to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. She has diabetes just like [[Scott Malkinson]].

During her self introduction in class, she mentions that she has diabetes, which makes Scott Malkinson develop a crush on her. She is fawned over by many of the boys in the school soon after she introduces herself. However, Scott does his best to chase them away but when he gets to hang out with her during recess he finds that Sophie was not interested in talking about diabetes unlike him and was unaware of his feelings towards her so he fails to connect with her until she brings up ''[[The Mandalorian]]''. Scott lies and says he watches it, and the two arrange to watch it at [[Malkinson Residence|his house]].

Since [[Clark Malkinson|his father]] was against streaming services, Scott goes to meet [[Nathan]], who is selling streaming accounts and passwords. He asks for Disney+ and trades it for some of his insulin. Scott gets his house decorated just as Sophie arrives. The two sit down to watch ''The Mandalorian'' but Disney+ goes down just as he starts it, thanks to Clark and the other cable workers taking the cables out. The two head to [[Valmer Residence|Jimmy's house]] but find Disney+ down there as well. The boys all try to comfort Sophie, angering Scott.

Sophie arrives home to find her Disney+ not working. The boys introduce themselves to Sophie's [[Mrs. Gray|mom]] while Scott eats a pie for a sugar rush. He then yells at the boys for trying to steal ""his girlfriend"", only for Sophie to tell him she is not his girlfriend. She then berates everyone for hitting on her when she only just moved here. Scott tries to explain they were meant together since they both have diabetes. Sophie explains she is more than her diabetes, but Scott realizes he is not.

Scott sits alone in the [[South Park Elementary Playground|playground]] and Sophie comes to comfort him. She tells him she is glad there is someone she can talk about diabetes with, and that she likes the ''Scott Malkinson Show''. 

Sophie is shown to be calm, empathetic, and friendly with people around her. She is a nice girl who likes to live life to the fullest and tries not to let her medical condition bother her.

Sophie has long orange hair tied into a side-swept braid with a thin strand on the side that she usually pushes out the way of her face and long bangs held back with a blue hairclip. She wears a pale pink shirt under a dark blue sweater, a violet-red skirt, and white stockings with black shoes.

Many of the 4th-grade boys at school became attracted to Sophie and try to flirt and hang out with her in ""[[Basic Cable]]"".

Scott instantly becomes infatuated with Sophie after hearing that she has diabetes. He believes he has fallen in love with her almost immediately upon meeting her and feels entitled to be with Sophie on the mere basis of their shared diabetes, focusing on no other aspect of her beyond her condition. He goes to great lengths to try to impress her and lashes out angrily at any boy who tries to pursue her, feeling threatened upon witnessing several boys also developing an attraction to her at the school. However, Sophie asserts that she is not his girlfriend or anybody's and that she is more than just her diabetes.

Although Sophie ultimately did not get into a romantic relationship with Scott or return his affection, she nonetheless expressed gratitude over having met someone new who could relate to the struggles diabetics face, and they remain friends.

South Park Crime Unit,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/South_Park_Crime_Unit,,"Stan acted as the leader of the group, likely the lieutenant. Stan's SPCU uniform was his trademark hat, a white T-shirt, and a Black Coat with his badge of the left breast. Stan's gun was his hand and he made ""bang bang"" sounds when firing. Stan wore the same jacket in ""[[Raisins]]"" when trying to win [[Wendy Testaburger]] back.

Kyle acted as the second in command, usually playing the role of the main detective. Kyle's SPCU uniform was his trademark green hat, a white T-shirt, and a brown overcoat (similar to what detectives wore in movies). Like Stan, he wore his badge of his left breast. Like Stan, his gun was his hand, which he made ""bang bang"" sounds when firing.

[[File:LilCrimeStoppers019.png|thumb|200px|SPCU's first headquarters, Cartman's basement.]]
Cartman acted as the group's ""Bad Cop"", and primary interrogator. Cartman acted with an out of character sense of respect and duty, unlike how he was when he was Barbrady's deputy in ""[[Chickenlover]]"". Cartman seemed to have Butters in mind as a primary suspect for Sara Peterson's Missing Doll and was intent on [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] giving a semen sample to prove his innocence. Cartman's SPCU uniform consisted of his trademark hat, a white shirt with a loose purple tie, and a blue unbuttoned coat. His yellow toy pistol had the butt of the gun visible behind his badge, which he wore on his left breast.

Kenny was the ""Good Cop"" during Cartman's interrogations, as well as the team's sketch artist (although all he ever drew was stick figures with large breasts, which he hung on his board ""Kenny's Most Wanted""). Kenny's SPCU uniform consisted of his Orange Parka, a cowboy themed holster with a toy pistol, which judging from Kenny's muffled gun noises may imply his was silenced. Kenny was the only team member to wear his badge on his right breast.

The team's secretary while they operated out of Cartman's basement. Liane's role to escort people to the boy's and to provide them with snacks, namely cookies and coffee.

Detective Kenny found that Duke, the old couple's dog ate the pie. However, Stan, Kyle and Eric all over analyzed the simplicity of the crime and accused the husband of premeditating to kill his elderly woman wife, in order to eat the pie.

[[File:LilCrimeStoppers023.png|thumb|200px|Sarah Peterson comes to the boys for help finding her doll.]]
The case that made the Crime Unit famous. The case was again overanalyzed by the four detectives:

[[File:LilCrimeStoppers066.png|thumb|200px|The shootout at the methlab.]]
After becoming official Junior Detectives, the boys, ignorant to what a meth lab was, stormed the front door. Stan knocked on the door and simply said ""Police, open up."" The men inside fired at the door above their heads, and through a series of freak accidents, killed themselves, while inflicting major damage on townsfolk and buildings around them.

After the Meth Lab incident, detectives [[Murphy and Jenkins]] taunted the ""super cops"" and divulged them on how they keep evidence from the crimes. Detective [[Hopkins]] was the only officer in Park County who was on the boys' side. None of the SPCU detectives report this, though this may have been out of intimidation, or because they didn't take them serious.

While the boys were showering in the station, Kyle wanted to leave the crime unit. Stan was agitated by this, telling reminding Kyle he wanted to help serve and protect South Park too. Again, out of character, Cartman stood up for Kyle stating ""Broflovski's a good cop!""

The next morning Lieutenant Dawson assigned the SPCU to investigate a Strip Club filled with Cop Killers, by the suspected masterminds of the drug syndicate. For this assignment they would go in undercover (all they did was remove their badges from visibility). After the briefing, Detectives Murphy and Jenkins approached the SPCU and asked if they told Dawson of their ""bonus money"". Kyle stated ""no."" and they walked off, and the two stated ""They're lying."" ""They're dead.""

[[File:LilCrimeStoppers091.png|thumb|right|200px|Gino's men, in another shootout.]]
At the Strip Club, it was revealed (while the SPCU was off screen) that the McCormick's house would begin making Meth again, implying Kenny's family made meth before for this drug boss, named [[Gino]]. Gino offered the boys to join their drug family, until one of the henchmen realized they were cops.

A shoot out ensued, with the boys taking cover and firing back with their fake guns, not realizing the danger of the situation. Outside, Lieutenant Dawson sent in Detectives, Jenkins, Murphy and Hopkins to assist the boys.

Here it was announced Murphy and Jenkins were working with Gino. After a short ceasefire, the drug dealers and the detectives began firing at each other. Hopkins easily dropped Gino' men, until Detective Jenkins shot Hopkins in his arm, injuring him. Following this, Murphy betrays Jenkins and Gino, killing both with a single head shot.

[[File:LilCrimeStoppers109.png|thumb|right|200px|The boys playing laundromat owners.]]
With no one else left standing with a gun, and at his mercy, Murphy announced he was in business alone, and the only person he couldn't trust was himself. With that shocking revelation, he shot himself.

Outside Lieutenant Dawson yelled at the SPCU for their methods, but then promoted them stating ""I'll probably regret this."" Kyle, Eric and Kenny looked at Stan nervously, who stated ""I think I have a better idea..."" and with that the South Park Crime Unit was dissolved, as the boys went back to play laundromat owners.

After the South Park Crime Unit was dissolved, it was apparent that all ties to the police force were severed. In ""[[The Coon]]"" it was shown that Kenny and Cartman still had a sense of justice and still wanted to help South Park, this time each taking up the role of vigilantes as [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]] and [[Mysterion]]. In ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", Kyle and Stan joined them in their super hero crusade as [[Human Kite]] and [[Toolshed]], respectively.

South Park Vampire Society,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/South_Park_Vampire_Society,,"is a group of students from [[South Park Elementary]] who dress up and portray themselves as vampires. They appeared prominently in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, ""[[The Ungroundable]]"" and the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]].""

The Vampire Kids are a group of kids who are fans of vampire fashion and subculture, especially the book series ''Twilight'' by Stephanie Meyer. They pretend to be vampires by wearing plastic fangs, drinking Clamato juice as a substitute for blood, and dressing in clothes from the store [[Hot Topic]]. Their Hangouts include the far side of the playground & the gymnasium.

They class themselves into the three known varieties of vampires, based on the actual vampire folklore: psy (psychic), sanguinarian (blood drinking), and hybrid (both psy and sanguinarian). However, only three known members of the clique have described themselves as such.

They go around accepting kids who they see as ""cool enough"" to join them, although they have allowed some the less popular kids join them on a trial basis. The [[Goth Kids]] took notice of them and became increasingly outraged by the growing size of the clique and felt that the vampire kids were ripping off their gothic style of dress and causing those of neither goth or vampire affiliation to confuse them with the other.

In an attempt to solve the problem, the Goth Kids first kidnapped the leader of the clique, [[Mike Makowski]] and FEDEX'ed him to the city of Scottsdale, thinking that getting rid of the head vampire would cause the other vampires to go back to being normal. However, the plan had no effect and the vampire clique continued to grow even larger. On the verge of accepting defeat, the goth kids were met by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who had also been among those who have been assimilated into the vampire clique. Unlike the rest of the kids however, Butters did not join because he thought of it as a fad, but instead actually believed he really was a vampire.

Wanting to free himself of his 'curse', Butters suggested the idea of destroying the vampires' lair, which would supposedly cause the vampires to become human again. He leads the Goth kids to the clothes store Hot Topic, as soon as the goth kids entered the store, they took out their cigarette lighters and cans of hairspray product, using them as makeshift flamethrowers and torched the whole store. 

[[File:GothKids3DawnOfThePosers00027.png|thumb|[[Unnamed Black Vampire|The Black Adult Male]] member of the Vampire Society.]]
In ""[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]"", the Vampire Kids are holding a meeting which is interrupted by [[Goth Kids]] [[Pete]] and [[Firkle Smith|Firkle]] who up until then were their sworn enemies. The Goths enlist the help of the Vampire Kids who they feel are the only other clique who understands the Emos. The Vampire leader, [[Mike Makowski]], and an [[Unnamed Black Vampire|adult Black Vampire Kid]] agree to help and during a seance they summon the spirit of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to help stop the Emos.

The Vampire kids make an appearance at the end of the game, teaming up with Clyde's forces. During the game's beta stages, the Vamp Kids were to be fought as regular enemies at the cemetery, but were scrapped from the game, possibly due to the previous company's bankruptcy while they were planning to complete the game.

The Vampire Kids have gone to [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]] to celebrate their leader, [[Mike Makowski]]'s birthday. As [[the New Kid]] and [[Mysterion]] arrived to take their newest member, [[Karen McCormick]], back home with them, they engage in combat against them.

They hold the vampire relics needed to open the door to the VIP section, and the New Kid, alongside Mysterion, [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]], and [[Henrietta Biggle]] must fight them several times.

Vampire Kids run the gambit with abilities, but the first thing to know about them is that their primary attack spells have life-drain effects similar to [[Mosquito]]'s attacks. These attacks can be initiated at short or long range. However, no life-drain attack may give a Vampire Kid more HP than their maximum HP.

Healer-class Vampire kids have a telegraphed move for revival, and can both heal and revive any Vampire Swarmers on their space. Unlike other combatants, a Vampire Swarmer's body will not get up and leave the battle grid just because a player's character walks onto the space. If a Vampire Swarmer is on an occupied space when they are revived, they will move to the closest adjacent space.

Members of the Vampire Society usually wear black clothing, from the Hot Topic store, and have various colored dyes in their hair. Several wear excessive amount of makeup on their faces.

Sparky,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Sparky,,"is [[Stan Marsh]]'s pet dog, who is (according to Stan) part Doberman and part wolf, and is claimed by Stan to be ""the toughest dog on the mountain"". This assertion is challenged, however, by other [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] residents when Sparky's homosexual nature manifests; first with [[Sylvester]] and then with [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s dog, [[Rex]]. He has made sporadic cameo appearances since.

Sparky seems to not wait for consent from other male dogs and instead proceeds to jump upon them and have sexual intercourse with them, much to the humiliation and confusion of the other dogs. Sparky also had a brief physical encounter with the mail-ordered female poodle, [[Fifi]], but his only interest in Fifi was her diamond-studded collar.

Overhearing Stan repeating an anti-gay tirade, first heard from [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], a heartbroken Sparky runs away to the shelter of [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary]]. Sparky enjoyed the idea of being accepted for who he was, but still missed Stan immensely. Stan too missed Sparky, and forgoing his responsibilities with the school football team, went in search of Sparky. Stan managed to locate the Big Gay Animal Shelter and Sparky was soon found and returned to Stan. Initially, Stan intends to help Sparky overcome his homosexuality, but [[Big Gay Al]] realizing that Stan still doesn't get it, has the two of them ride his Big Gay Boat Ride, where Stan learned that being gay is okay.

Sparky was briefly seen in ""[[Spookyfish]]"" where he was seen digging up one of Sharon's dug up bodies.

Sparky then appeared in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"" in which Stan proceeds to masturbate him, thinking that he's playing a game he learned from [[The 6th Graders]], called ""Red Rocket"", in which one 'milks the dog'. Sparky, however, did not get to climax and was left to run off, still aroused.

Sparky suffered for the irresponsibility of Stan and [[The Boys|the boys]] when they threw a throwing star into the eye of [[Butters Stotch]] in the episode, ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"". Rather than take Butters to the hospital, they shaved Sparky of his fur and glued it to Butters, with the intention of taking him to the vet under the disguise of a dog, and to avoid getting in trouble for playing with weapons. Sparky was obviously not pleased with the abuse.

He has a small cameo in ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"" when Stan returns home at the end of the episode.

Sparky is mentioned once in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", when [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] said she found Stan's and her egg in his dog's mouth.

Sparky makes his next appearance in the series twelve years later, in the [[Season Twenty]] episode ""[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]"". He is briefly seen at the end of the episode with the Marsh family as they are watching the news.

In ""[[Help, My Teenager Hates Me!]]"", Stan mentions his experience with Sparky, saying he ""had a gay dog"" and that he was one of the first people to say it was okay to be gay. Stan's claim he ""had a gay dog"" in the past tense, his current fate and whereabouts are unknown. Sparky was originally voiced by actor [[George Clooney]]. In interviews, [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] have stated that they have invited major celebrities to voice minor characters in the pursuit of creating layers of irony on the show.

Sparky appears as one of Stan's attacks, in which he uses a laser pointer to direct Sparky to the enemy to lower the enemy's defense. When you choose Cartman's side when attacking the school, Sparky appears as an enemy in Stan's boss battle. When Stan's health is low, Sparky starts licking him and Stan regains part of his health. During the final boss battle, he is seen dragging the Nazi zombie unicorn's head after Stan chops it off.

Geeky Computer Guys,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Geeky_Computer_Guys,,"(also called the '''Star Trek Nerds''') are two male college students who sometimes help out [[the boys]] in times of trouble. They have shown to be useful and talented in both science as well as special effects, but also to get into squabbles with each other over trivial things, such as the number of episodes in ''Star Trek: The Original Series''.

They made their first appearance in ""[[Fourth Grade]]"", where they build two time machines for the boys, in order to return to the third grade. 

They reappeared briefly in ""[[Freak Strike]]"", where they helped the boys attach a set of prosthetic testes to Butters' chin so he can go on the [[Maury Povich]] show, in exchange for an edited copy of ''Star Wars Episode I: the Phantom Menace''.

They were also seen worshipping with the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] in ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"".

In ""[[Cock Magic]]"", they appeared in the background watching the [[Magic: The Gathering (CCG)]] game at the Hobby store.

Both of the nerds wear sandals and round-framed glasses. The first nerd wears light blue shorts, a navy blue shirt with the words ""Resistance is futile!"" written in green, and a green coat. He has long blond hair in the style of a ponytail.

The other nerd wears green pants, a black shirt with the words ""Yeah, resistance is futile!"" written in red, and a black wrist brace. He has short brown hair, which is receding, and has a brown mustache and beard.

Starvin' Marvin,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Starvin%27_Marvin_(Character),,"is a thin little boy from [[Ethiopia]], who first appeared in the episode, ""[[Starvin' Marvin]]"".

In his first appearance in ""[[Starvin' Marvin]]"", Marvin was accidentally shipped over to the boys, who then took him into their custody, and tried to teach him the ways of the [[United States|Americans]]. However, they are eventually found out, and forced to return him to Ethiopia, but not without a large number of mutant turkeys to feed his family.

In his second and most recent major appearance in ""[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]"", Marvin got control of a spaceship, which he and the boys used to travel to outer space. Later in the episode, Marvin brought all of the other Ethiopians to the paradise planet [[Marklar (Planet)|Marklar]].

Marvin makes a brief cameo in the 100th episode, ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"" in the large crowd at the very end. It is not explained how he returned from Marklar. Though a group of [[Marklar|Marklars]] were spotted next to him and presumably took him with them.

He does not know how to speak English, but he learns how to say a few of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s catchphrases, such as ""Sweet!"" or ""Yeah, I want the [[Cheesy Poofs]]!"". He also learned how to say his name (that is, the name the boys give him). His real name in his clicking-based language sounds something like ""(click)-(oh-in-uh)-ma'bin"" - the boys find this difficult to pronounce and shorten it to just ""Marvin"" based on the ending. According to the government agents who greet his parents, his surname is ""(click)-(click)-derk"".

Starvin' Marvin is incredibly malnourished due to the famine in his home country, thus appearing incredibly emaciated. He has nothing to wear except a dirty loincloth.

Stephen Abootman,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Stephen_Abootman,,"was the head of the [[World Canadian Bureau]] (WGA) in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, ""[[Canada on Strike]]"".

In ""[[Canada on Strike]]"", he decided to lead the country on a nationwide strike due to the lack of respect shown to [[Canada]] on Canada Appreciation Day. The strike had massive consequences, causing many Canadians to die from starvation and exposure. Furthermore, the strike failed as nobody seemingly even cared about Canada, and the [[Denmark|Danish]] moved in to begin replacing them.

In order to save his Canadian stepbrother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[The Boys|the boys]] managed to persuade the world leaders to give them a small consolation prize - bubblegum and a coupon entitling every Canadian to a free meal at [[Bennigan's]] (with the purchase of a meal of equal or greater value, of course). However, [[Terrance and Phillip]] gatecrash the celebration party and tell the Canadian people that, in fact, [[Canada]] lost far more revenue striking. The Canadians then banished Abootman and his aides, setting them adrift on an ice floe.

Stephen Abootman had two assistants which were almost always by his side, similar to [[Mayor McDaniels]]' assistants. One of the assistants had dark brown hair and mustache and wore a khaki suit. The other had black hair and a dark blue suit.

He, or a similar character, later appeared in the episode ""[[Royal Pudding]]"", committing suicide by jumping in front of a moving train.

Like the other Canadians, he has beady eyes and a Pac-Man-like head that flaps up and down. He has brown hair and wears a black suit with a tie.

In ""[[Royal Pudding]]"", his appearance is slightly different as he has a dark blue suit, a piece of his white shirt sticking out, and a stubble. Despite a striking visual similarity, it cannot be said for sure whether this was the same character.

Abootman is incredibly unintelligent, egotistical and self-centered. He calls the strike in order to gain respect from the world, but his actions only serve to massively damage the nation. Concerned only with his reputation, however, he decides to continue the strike despite the massive loss of life. In the end, he only agrees to end the strike if it was made out to be successful so he won't look like an idiot.

Stephen Stotch,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Stephen_Stotch,,"In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", he is willing to sell Butters as [[Paris Hilton]]'s pet for a large sum of money. 
*'''Lying To Authorities/Filing a False Police Report:''' In ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", he and his wife lie to police and the press by saying that Butters was kidnapped by a Puerto Rican man when in actuality his wife put him in her car, which was streaming down bodies of water.
*'''Murder: ''' In ""[[Marjorine]]"", Stephen murders a curtain company employee with a shovel to feed Butters when they believe that his ""resurrection"" made him a hell-spawn.

[[File:Untitled 2.jpg|thumb|''Stephen'' Stotch's first appearance in ""[[Chickenlover]]""]]
In ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", Stephen is revealed to be bi-curious, in that he likes women, but he is seen going to a gay men's bathhouse to perform homosexual activities. After it nearly cost him his family and marriage, he suppressed these urges. However, in ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", he reveals his sexuality to Butters and does not mind if his son turns out the same way.

At times, Stephen seems to be homophobic. At the beginning of ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"", when he walks in on Butters with [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s penis in his mouth, he fears his son is turning gay and sends him to a camp where they supposedly ""pray the gay away"". Also, in ""[[Raisins]]"", it is revealed that he made a bet with his wife that their son would not turn out gay. When Butters tells them about his love interest, [[Lexus]], Linda admits that Stephen beat her.

In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', there is a small quest involving breaking into a safe in Stephen's room. In the safe, there is a picture of him on the couch naked, on his hands and knees, with a seemingly pleasured face, implying that he was engaging in sexual activity with another man. The picture was labeled ""wrestling"". If you take the picture back to him, he gives you 20 dollars, possibly as a bribe, and says ""I don't want any trouble from you Vigilante"". At some point in the game, if you go into his bathroom, Linda Stotch can be seen bathing and reading a book titled ""Dealing with your gay husband"" implying that she may still fear/know that he is still into men, though she appears to be nonchalant about it.

When he was first given an in-depth role in ""[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]"", Stephen appeared to be a very loving, almost a sitcom-like father, making bad, yet good-natured jokes and being rather sweet to his wife and son. However, as the episode progressed his bi-curious lifestyle was revealed, as was his desire to use extreme methods to cover-up things that could negatively affect him. 

In later episodes, he is noted for the harsh way in which he treats his son, Butters, as he often grounds him for little things or things that were not his fault, or that he had no control over such as in ""[[The Ungroundable]]"". He has beaten him on a few occasions, such as ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", and openly snapping at Butters, such as telling him to shut his mouth, as seen in ""[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]"".

There is some debate over whether he really cares for Butters. His relationship with Butters is best described as ""inconsistent""; although there have been instances where he has demonstrated his love and affection for Butters (such as in ""[[Casa Bonita]]""), he often grounds butters for reasons that would normally be considered foolish and ridiculous and has abused him on numerous occasions. He has a very heavy-handed approach to discipline, which has resulted in Butters seeing him as a kind of monster, as shown in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]"". 

He is also extremely selfish, as he often considers his needs and ambitions above those of his son, as demonstrated in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"". 

Stephen is a hypocrite and rarely takes responsibility for his own actions. In ""[[Pre-School]]"", he was quick to convince his wife that it was neither of their faults that Butters was badly beaten up by a bully on their doorstep, even though it was him who refused to let a frantic Butters back in the house. Additionally, in ""[[City Sushi]]"", when Stephen and Linda discovered Butters had inadvertently caused an [[Asian Turf War]] when wondering why Butters always caused so much trouble, he immediately ruled out the possibility of being bad parents, claiming he and Linda were ""awesome"".

At times, he does seem slightly more down to earth than the other adults in town, as seen in ""[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]"". Most often than not, he usually will overreact though, like all the other adults. He can also be noted for the strange manner in which he cries or weeps.

He is also shown to be very cautious about personal and social hygiene since the COVID-19 pandemic started, scolding Butters for still wanting to go to the [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] during the pandemic and criticizing a group of people for not wearing protective masks properly, mockingly calling them ""chin diapers"" as seen in ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"".

He is the coach of the little league baseball team. In ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", he is seen working in a cubicle.

In ""[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]"", he is shown as a movie theater projectionist, though this occupation has not been looked into any further than this episode.

In ""[[Unfulfilled]]"", he gets a new job at the [[Amazon Fulfillment Center]].

Stephen normally drives an animated version of an orange Lexus SUV, but in ""[[Smug Alert!]]"" and ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"" it is shown that the family also owns a Prius-like MPV. In ""[[Smug Alert!]]"" he changed his car to a ""Hybrid"" but then changed back to his normal vehicle at the end of the episode.

He wears a drab, olive-green shirt, a distinctive white tie, blue jeans, brown belt, and black sneakers. He has brown hair, in a style similar to a grown-out crew cut. He is also seen smoking a pipe at times, suggesting that he could be a regular smoker.

Stephen's name suggests German and/or Scottish heritage.

[[File:TFBW Stephen Stotch.jpg|thumb|A drunk Stephen has flashbacks about his mother.]]
During [[The Thin White Line]] mission in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', as the player approaches a drunk Stephen, he has flashbacks to his mother grounding him and pleads with his mother not ground him in a distressed tone. Based on this it can be inferred that Stephen had a nearly identical relationship with his [[Grandma Stotch|mother]] as he has with his son, and his overbearing demeanor is a result of his past. However, in ""[[Butterballs]]"", he seems composed when his mother visits South Park and is oblivious towards her abusive attitude towards Butters. Either Stephen and his mother improved their relationship, or he is aware of her true colors and stays silent out of fear.

[[Linda Stotch]] is Stephen's quiet—and at times, submissive—wife. They normally appear to be a sweet and loving couple, who are often on the same wavelength regarding each other, and their raising of their son, Butters. However, their marriage suffers a painful shock when Linda discovers that Stephen is having homosexual affairs. This ends up driving her insane, and she attempts to kill Butters—and later, herself. While attempting to cover-up her supposed murder of their son, they create an elaborate lie regarding ""some Puerto Rican guy"". However, the lie soon becomes too complicated, and they fight constantly over how to keep the story straight until at last, they confess the truth. They seem to have recovered from that incident and have never discussed it again.

Linda constantly changes between calling him ""Stephen"" and ""Chris"". Since he is called ""Stephen"" more often than he is called ""Chris"", it can be assumed that ""Chris"" could be his middle name, although he states that his middle name is ""Willis"" in ""[[The Magic Bush]]"".

[[Butters Stotch]] is Stephen's son and only child. Stephen has been shown to sometimes care about Butters, but he often treats him very harshly, though he claims that it is for Butters' own good. However, in ""[[Marjorine]]"", when Butters pretends to kill himself, Stephen and Linda take his death horribly, and Stephen even goes so far as to bury what he believes to be Butters' body in an Indian Burial Ground in the hopes of reviving him. Eventually, he comes to believe that doing so would create a monster, and thus when Butters arrives home, he locks his son in the basement and feeds him dead bodies. Overall, while there have been many times he has given his son unfair punishment, it can be generally concluded that he does indeed love his son, as he said so in tears in [[City Sushi]].

He is a good friend of [[Randy Marsh]] and [[Gerald Broflovski]] and he is among the more prominent adults of the town. He has accompanied Randy and Gerald on many expeditions, such as when they try to save their kids in ""[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]"" even when his own son was not missing. He and Linda also invited the Marshes, Broflovskis, and Cartmans to accompany them to Aspen in ""[[Asspen]]"".

[[File:140a.jpg|thumb|Stephen on [[South Park Studios]].]]
Stephen can be found at [[Stotch Residence|his home]] where he will befriend [[The New Kid]] on Facebook and will later appear in the PTA meeting and at [[Donovan Residence]], in front of [[Clyde's Fortress]], to bring home Butters.

He plays a major role in the game, where he ground Butters and The New Kid and locks them in his room. After they manage to get out a Boss Fight will begin against him that ground everyone except The New Kid. Plus, after The New Kid finds a photo of him, Stephen will give 20 dollars if he chooses to return it.

Steve,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Steve,,"is the lead [[Tardicaca Camp Counselors|Tardicaca Camp counselor]] and a teacher at [[South Park Elementary]] who works with the [[Special Ed Kids|special education students]]. He first appears in [[Season Fourteen]] episode, ""[[Crippled Summer]]"".

Counselor Steve made his first appearance in ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", where he was first seen helping [[Lenora]] dry herself with [[Towelie]] and generally supervising the children. Throughout the episode as [[Nathan]] and [[Mimsy]] are discussing methods to sabotage or kill [[Jimmy]] and his team, Steve appears to ask the two boys if they are enjoying the camp and Nathan resorts to a simple, childish voice to declare an obvious fact, such as how warm it is, to prevent Steve from figuring out what they are up to.

He reappears in ""[[Handicar]]"" as a school special education teacher, helping the kids raise money for summer camp, with [[Timmy Burch]] raising much of the money through his ride-share service.

He can be seen in the background of ""[[You're Not Yelping]]"" as a Yelper.

He was also seen supervising the Special Ed students for their science fair in ""[[Moss Piglets]]"", which confirmed he was working at [[South Park Elementary]], and encouraging all of his students to do their best, being particularly impressed with Timmy and Jimmy's project. He has since been seen at the school in the background alongside other teachers.

Steve has long light curly brown hair and brown eyebrows. As a comp counselor, he wears a white shirt with the Tardicaca Camp logo in green in the middle, black shorts with red details and a black flip flop. As a teacher from ""[[Moss Piglets]]"" on, he wears a dark green shirt under a white coat with a pen in his right pocket.

In ""[[You're Not Yelping]]"" Steve wears a t-shirt with the word ""You need my YELP"" written in white.

Steve tries to be encouraging to the campers and make sure everyone is included, striving for a positive environment.

During the [[Bring the Crunch (Mission)|Bring the Crunch]] storyline, Jimmy summons [[The New Kid]] for help, explaining that the Lake Tardicaca camp counselors are missing and that if they are not located, the camp will be shut down. Drug-addicted criminals dress up as monsters in costumes to scare the kids and the bodies of many counselors are found, while another commits suicide. When it is revealed Nathan has been orchestrating these events, and that Mimsy has been murdering the counselors for him because of another typical misunderstanding between them, multiple characters suggest only a single female counselor remains, and a [[Coonstagram]] photograph shows Counselor Steve's corpse, seeming to confirm as a victim of Mimsy's actions.

An unused cutscene/prop suggested he was originally going to appear directly.

In the episode ""[[Moss Piglets]]"" after the main game's release, Counselor Steve appears alive and well at school, and he later appears in ""[[Dead Kids]]"" after the downloadable content's release.

Steve Black,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Steve_Black,,"is the father of [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]] and husband of [[Linda Black|Mrs. Black]]. He is very wealthy, owning a large house and an expensive SUV, and a diehard fan of author J.R.R. Tolkien. He previously worked as a lawyer and as co-executive of a financial consulting firm until he entered the marijuana farming business.

He makes his first appearance in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"". His name is given as Steve in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"". 

Steve's first speaking role was in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", in which after [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is arrested for throwing a rock at his son Tolkien, and arrested for committing a Hate Crime. Mr. Black, however, disagrees with hate crime legislation and educates the boys on why it's a hypocritical concept. He then sends the boys to the governor to change the laws. He would have done it himself but mentions that he was black. He later appears in the background of [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]]'s protest of the [[South Park Flag]], with Tolkien and Mrs. Black in ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"".

He and his wife were part of the Marsh Family's book club, as seen in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", and seem to be referred to as 'Bob and Linda' since the other fathers present all had been previously named, but they did not speak here.

His second speaking role was in the episode ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"", in which Tolkien begins to question why they are so rich while everyone else is poor. Mr. Black reveals that Mrs. Black is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, while he is revealed to be a lawyer. Both of Tolkien's parents are horrified when Tolkien wants to shop at J-Mart and he seems to not understand how to shop like middle-class people. He is so out of touch with middle-class society, that he mistakes the fluorescent lights for an alien weapon and he even handed his car keys to a J-Mart employee, thinking he was the valet.

His next appearance was in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"", in which he and his wife are horrified to discover that Tolkien was seen the pornographic film called, ''[[Back Door Sluts 9]]''. When Mr. Black demonstrates horror at discovering Tolkien has seen the porno, he exclaims ""Oh god, not that one!"", causing Mrs. Black to give him a furious look. His name was revealed to be Steve in this episode.

He is one of [[Randy Marsh]]'s drinking buddies in ""[[Broadway Bro Down]]"" and later in ""[[Insecurity]]"" when he and the dads become insecure that the UPS man is having sex with their wives.

He and Linda allow [[Liane Cartman]] and [[Eric Cartman]] to stay at their [[Black Residence|home]] after a fire damaged their home in ""[[1%]]"". Even though Steve was generous, his wife Linda was surprised that Cartman and Tolkien were friends.

In ""[[Sons A Witches]]"", he is one of the dads who attends ""Crack and Jack Witch Week"" at Halloween every year, a tradition going back a few decades, and is part of the campaign to clarify not all witches are bad.

Cartman had dinner with the family in ""[[Doubling Down]]"", questioning when they could disrespect the American flag until Steve happened to mention seeing [[Heidi Turner]] with [[Kyle Broflovski]], unaware of their relationships with Cartman.

He and his wife again sat with Cartman for dinner in  ""[[Dead Kids]]"", where it is revealed that he and his wife have a regular date night and do not allow their son to watch PG-13 films unsupervised.

It is revealed in ""[[The Big Fix]]"" that Steve named his son after his favorite author, J.R.R. Tolkien, of whom he has been a fan for much of his life, does not believe in drinking or smoking, and has become co-executive of a financial consulting firm. 

Initially hired by Randy as a financial consultant for [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]], Steve leaves the company and moves his family to a marijuana farm across the street named [[Credigree Weed]] since ""[[The Big Fix]]"". His first competition against Tegridy Farms involves the sales of ""St. Patrick's Day"" specials. After receiving a large order of 2.5 tons from [[Farty O'Cool]], Steve buys all of Randy's stocks while the latter is in jail and labels them as his own, in order to keep up with the demand. This plot is later exposed by Randy himself.

Steve establishes a streaming service in ''[[South Park: The Streaming Wars]]'', where the water rights of his farm are being sold to the [[City People (Group)|citizens]] of [[Denver]] who are experiencing a drought. When Steve informs [[Pi-Pi]] that he would be closing the service owing to water shortage for the crops, he realizes that the latter had been the mastermind behind the drought, and gets assaulted by Pi-Pi's newly recruited henchman, [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]]. Steve is subsequently saved by [[Chuck Chuck]], and he returns to Randy, convincing him to work together to expose Pi-Pi's scheme.

Steve is a middle-aged man and he wears a blue jacket, white shirt, and black tie. He also wears brown/red pants and black shoes. He has black curly hair.

In [[Operation: Blind Justice]], [[The New Kid|the new kid]] is tasked to intrude the [[Black Residence]] and apprehend Steve, whom [[Harrison Yates]] claimed that he is a ""mastermind drug dealer"".

In ""[[Grounded Vindaloop]]"", Steve is a computer program that provides nearly all customer services, and most importantly, functions as an interface between users and the virtual reality system. His process terminates whenever he receives positive feedback, then he can send requests to the system. However, his inability to explain things prevents this from happening, causing more calls to customer service, which cause [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to fall deeper and deeper into nested virtual realities.

Steve calls himself after assuming that Stan has dropped a call because of a connection problem, but finds that even Steve himself isn't content with his service, which throws the system into a ""customer feedback vindaloop"". To fix this problem, he has to recontact Stan, the only real client in virtual reality, and demand positive feedback, which Stan eventually gives. The system is then reset and Stan is able to return to reality.

Steve tells Satan that he is the real crocodile hunter, causing Satan to realize it is him and throw him out of his party because he didn't have a costume on. Irwin's appearance in this episode was a source of controversy, as it aired only weeks after his actual death by a stingray. This is despite the fact that the stingray got away and Steve got killed from a helicopter blade in an earlier episode.

In the episode ""[[Stanley's Cup]]"", [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] tries to convince the [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]] he is coaching that the Denver team won't kill them, and one of the players responds with, ""That's what Steve Irwin said about those stingrays,"" referencing Irwin's cause of death.

Steve Jobs,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Steve_Jobs,,"was the former CEO of Apple Inc. He died on October 5, 2011.

Jobs later appeared and played a major role in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"". Still striving to ""create the future"" by spearheading technological innovation, Jobs directs the creation of a new electronic appliance, the [[HUMANCENTiPAD (Product)|HUMANCENTiPAD]], which consists of three people surgically joined together, mouth to anus.

Because people were already able to share all their videos, music, photos and shit, Jobs reasoned that the only thing left for the iPad to do was walk and read. He hoped to achieve this with his new project. Using [[Junichi Takiyama|a Japanese man]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] and an unnamed woman as test subjects, Jobs attempts to get the HUMANCENTiPAD to read terms and conditions before accepting. After a string of abject failures, he is eventually successful.

He then plans to present the HUMANCENTiPAD to [[Eric Cartman]] as a gift, however, [[Gerald Broflovski]] persuades him to sit down and enjoy the present before attempting to create the future. Jobs concedes, agreeing to get Kyle separated from the HUMANCENTiPAD, understanding that through his work he has already left his mark on the world by ""connecting"" people everywhere.

In ""[[The Entity]]"", he appears with dark brown hair, wearing a brown suit and black shirt. In ""[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]"", he wore his trademark black shirt and blue jeans. He aged significantly between these two episodes.

Steven has been a Blaintologist for three years. He is the person in charge of the David Blaine Workshop. He welcomes new arrivals and asks them deceptive, meditative questions which have no definite answers. When new arrivals get puzzled and confused, he introduces the ""miraculous"" book ""[[David Blaine: Teachings]]"" to them, claiming that answers to these difficult questions can be found inside. As they are influenced to believe in Blaintology, Steven asks new Blaintologists to recruit more potential members for David Blaine's big magic show in [[Denver]].

David Blaine's demand for tax-exempt status gets turned down by the government, so he arranges a mass suicide at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]].

After arriving at the Lincoln Memorial, Steven becomes the first person to die for the cult as he demonstrates to others how to drown themselves in the Reflecting Pool.

Steven Seagal,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Steven_Seagal,,"is an American actor who appears in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, ""[[Safe Space]]"".

Steven Seagal is brought in by [[PC Principal]] to give a speech on body shaming, as he too suffers from it. [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] is then told to help him, just like he is helping [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. He also appears singing in the song ""[[In My Safe Space]]"", as well as at [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]'s charity dinner. He tries, unsuccessfully, to protect Randy from being pressured into donating money at the [[Whole Foods Market]]. He leaves after the [[Whole Foods Cashier|cashier]] references Seagal's movies going ""direct to cable"". He also unsuccessfully stops [[Reality]] from taking the stage at the charity dinner. It is worth mentioning that in both of these scenarios, Seagal does nothing but stand there with a gun.

He is overweight, and he has black hair pulled back in a ponytail with glasses. During most of the episode, he wears a black leather jacket (that is not big enough for him as his stomach sticks out at the bottom) and black pants. At the charity dinner, this is replaced with a white suit. In most scenes with Seagal, he is holding a pistol.

Like the other celebrities in this episode, Seagal cares very much about what others think of him. He cares enough that he needs the help of a fourth-grader to give him only the positive comments. He voices his discontent the most of anyone in this episode (perhaps besides Cartman), crying when he is told something he does not like. He is very sensitive about his weight, and his acting career.

Steven Spielberg,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Steven_Spielberg,,"is an American film director known for such iconic films as the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series, ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', and many more. He is known to often collaborate with fellow filmmaker [[George Lucas]]. He first appears in the [[Season Five]] episode, ""[[Cripple Fight]]"".

In ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", Spielberg is briefly seen withdrawing his support for the Mountain Scouts in support of gay rights after he finds out they banned [[Big Gay Al]] and gays from serving in their organization.

Spielberg is featured more prominently in the episode ""[[Free Hat]]"", in which he and [[George Lucas]] release updated versions of their previous films, such as ''Star Wars'' and ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' with numerous and increasingly nonsensical changes, such as replacing guns with walkie-talkies. [[The boys]] campaign to stop them from editing films, but inspire Spielberg and Lucas to make changes to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.

Spielberg is depicted as the more dominant and controlling of the two directors whom Lucas is submissive towards and believes he belongs to, behaving like a servant. The boys make an attempt to convince Lucas to return to them the original film version of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', and Lucas seemed to agree with them until Spielberg arrived. Spielberg later convinces [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] to surrender so that the new movie can be seen. However, during the screening of the remastered version of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', Spielberg and his associates' heads explodes because the changes make the film so terrible.

In the episode ""[[The China Probrem]]"", Lucas and Spielberg reappear, having apparently survived their initial encounter with the boys (or were resurrected through unknown means) having worked together on ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', as in real life. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], as well as the local district attorney and [[Mitch Murphy]] were horrified by the film, all remembering it as a series of graphic scenes in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape their beloved Indiana Jones character. ([[Butters Stotch|Butters]] enjoyed it, however.)

The boys, the district attorney and Murphy work together to file a lawsuit against Lucas and Spielberg for the rape. When the police arrive  at their home, they instead find that Lucas and Spielberg are still in the process of gang-raping a ''Star Wars'' [[Stormtrooper]], and they are subsequently arrested. The police later inform the boys that they found the dead raped bodies of Short Round and Yoda in the basement at Skywalker Ranch.

Throughout the episode, various versions of Spielberg are seen during the rape flashbacks experienced by people who saw the films. Each version is a parody of the films ''Boys Don't Cry'' (lines only), ''The Accused'', and ''Deliverance''.

In ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"", Spielberg and Lucas, with [[Indiana Jones]] on a leash and in a ball-gag, are both members of [[Tom Cruise]]'s class-action lawsuit and usually seen together. Spielberg cautions Cruise that involving [[Barbra Streisand]] may be dangerous as she has not been active for a long time, and questions if they should activate her again.

Steven Spielberg has been redesigned several times in his numerous appearances throughout the series. In ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", he appeared briefly behind his desk dressed in a turquoise suit, pink shirt, and blue hat. He was seen wearing glasses and had grey hair and beard, similar to his real-life appearance. In ""[[Free Hat]]"", he appeared dressed almost identically to the ''Indiana Jones'' character [[w:c:indianajones:René Emile Belloq|Belloq]], in a white suit and fedora, with a blue shirt and dark blue tie. 

He was heavily redesigned for his appearance in ""[[The China Probrem]]"", in which he appeared dressed in a black coat, grey shirt, and brown trousers. He was also occasionally wearing a hat with ""Director"" emblazoned on it. His hair now has a different texture including some brown hair on top of his head and a different pair of glasses. He retained this look in future appearances.

She made her debut appearance in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, ""[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"", where [[PC Principal]] develops conflicting, romantic feelings for her which are later revealed to be reciprocated by her.

Strong Woman, like her co-worker [[PC Principal]], is deeply concerned with social justice. She tries to not follow gender stereotypes, discourages people from believing in them or using them and appears embarrassed when she does conform to them. She seems deeply concerned about children, not only expressing worry about her own as well as the safety of her students, but expresses fear that her mistakes will undermine her ability to set a positive example. She is also somewhat blunt, aggressively telling [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] his anger towards [[Canada]] was ridiculous, despite liking him as a student. She is notably less aggressive, however, than PC Principal - despite her strength, she is not seen threatening violence towards those who disagree with her.

(talking to Cartman dressed as a cop) It's just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend, and our two kids. And my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob who I met last year.
<br />'''Cartman:''' (to the camera) Poor people tend to live in clusters.
<br />'''Stuart:''' What? What did you say?

Being a heavy alcoholic, Stuart is drunk most of the time. He is shown to often argue and abuse his wife, but it appears to go both ways, as in some episodes [[Carol McCormick|Carol]] berates him without direct provocation. Although he and his wife have been shown physically abusing each other, it has never been shown or implied that Stuart abuses his children. When he is sober, he is very loving and caring to his wife. In ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", the two of them decided to have another child. When Kenny, trying to kill the unborn baby, offered his mother a drink, which he had blended a whole bottle of abortion pills into, and she explained that she couldn't take alcohol while pregnant, Stuart offered to drink it for her. He also tried to stop Kenny when he tried to plunge the baby out of his wife and at the end is the one to suggest they name the baby Kenny.

In the episode ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"" it is revealed that Stuart and his wife had been part of a cult centered around [[Cthulhu]] ten years before the series' events and that he had been with Carol at the time. He and his wife claim to have been extremely drunk while there - something their son does not question. It is also revealed that Kenny, disguised as [[Mysterion]], has been scaring Stuart and Carol not to get high at night, fight as much, and to pay their children allowances.

Stuart and his family live in a run-down old bungalow. In ""[[Chickenpox]]"", it is revealed the house was made by Stuart and [[Gerald Broflovski]] when they were young. Their car is dismantled in front of the home and is home to stray cats and dogs. Inside it is dirty and stained. The McCormicks do not own much modern technology, as the family video game system is a ColecoVision, which is plugged into a monochrome television. In ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", the North Park Funland commercial is shown in color, implying that somewhere between the episodes ""[[Chickenpox]]"" and ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"", the McCormicks procured a color television. In ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"", they somehow managed to afford a Robot Security Guard to protect Kenny's cremated body. In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", the house was upgraded on the exterior, and he does seem to care about his house, as he got pissed off at Randy and told him ""I don't want you touching my damn house!""

In ""[[Chickenpox]]"", it is also mentioned that Stuart used to work in a pizza factory when he was a teenager. He is currently jobless, due in major part to his alcoholism, and he and his family are on welfare, and live mainly off of plain frozen waffles, pop tarts, and bread sandwiches because of this. However, in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"" it is proved that the McCormicks run a Meth lab. In ""[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]"", it was stated by the Bar owners that the McCormick's make Meth for them.

In more recent episodes Stuart has been shown to have improved his family situation somewhat in that the McCormicks are off welfare and Stuart has found a steady job working in an Amazon warehouse.

[[File:StuartSPS.jpg|thumb|left|Stuart on [[South Park Studios]].]]
It was presumed this was Kenny's father's first appearance in the Season One episode, ""[[Death]]"". During the commentary on this episode, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone deny it was Stuart McCormick and claim it was another non-related McCormick due to his not wearing the signature red ""Scotch"" cap and having dark brown hair and a goatee mustache.

Stuart has long, messy light brown hair and a brown mustache. He wears a white shirt under a light blue jacket with sleeves going up to his elbow, a black belt with a gray buckle, blue pants and black shoes. He also wears a red cap with a black border and a yellow sign with ""SCOTCH"" written on it. He has several dirt marks on his clothes and on his face and seems to have something that looks like a chain in his left pocket that goes up to the belt. When sleeping he wears dark blue pajamas.

On special occasions he wears a denim jacket over his shirt, but in later seasons he wore a brown tuxedo, white dress shirt, red bow-tie and blue pants.

In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", he is seen wearing a bandana without his hat, a fancy sleeveless shirt, white cowboy shoes, and blue pants.

After [[Season Thirteen]], his character design model was re-polished, like many other characters. He now has two brown cloths sewn onto his coat in place of the yellow stickers.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Stuart appears as an elderly man in [[Shady Acres]]. He has visibly aged and gained weight; his hair is now greyed and longer, and he now sports a goatee underneath his mustache. He still wears his light blue jacket, except it is now untucked and unbuttoned, revealing a stained, white shirt. He now wears white shoes. 

Stuart's surname suggests Irish and/or Scottish ancestry.

She is Stuart's wife and mother of [[Kevin McCormick|Kevin]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and [[Karen McCormick|Karen]]. Little is known of their past, but they have been together for at least ten years, likely as old as their elder son, and share a love of drinking and drugs.

Stuart is shown to care deeply for his wife, when he is sober. When drunk, he and his wife frequently argue and get into domestic squabbles, although it seems to be reinforced that they do care about each other, particularly in ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"". A perfect summary for their relatinship is shown in ""[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]"", when the two are overheard aguing over meth. The confrontation turns physical when Stuart hits Carol, and she hits him back. However, this just leads to Stuart proclaming his love to Carol, and the two decide to get high and have sex.

In ""[[Insecurity]]"", he mentions ""If you found out '''my''' wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me"".

Kevin is Stuart's elder son. His canon age is unknown, but he is usually presumed to be as old as [[Shelly Marsh]] (around thirteen years old). His relationship with Stuart tends to be strained, enough so that during a drunken fight with Stuart, both he and his wife are arrested.

Kenny is Stuart's younger son. Stuart is shown to care for Kenny, as he plays catch with him in ""[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]"".

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', when the army is shown singing, Stuart has a picture of Kenny on his helmet.

In ""[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]"", Stuart was seen to be shocked and mortified at Kenny's deceased remains, which further reinforces his love and care for his son.

In '[[Cripple Fight]]', he also gets shocked when nude pictures of Kenny were shown on television, which were taken by the Scout Leader.

Karen was seen with the McCormick's in the hospital in ""[[Best Friends Forever]]"", she had no speaking lines.

She made a second appearance in ""[[The Poor Kid]]"". Her name was confirmed by [[Matt Stone]]. Stuart's relationship with Karen has not been expanded on so it is unclear how he views her as a father.

In ""[[Fat Camp]]"", while performing on the ""Krazy Kenny Show"", Kenny gave his grandfather a Swedish massage. The old man's name was not given, so it is unclear whether he is Stuart's father or father-in-law.

Stuart frequently hangs out with the other local men at the bar. Being the father of one of the main characters, he is closest to [[Randy Marsh]], [[Gerald Broflovski]], and [[Stephen Stotch]]. Although, he is not as relevant as the other fathers.

Mentioned in '[[Cripple Fight]]', it was said that Stuart and Randy used to go to Boy Scouts when they were younger. Randy and Stuart are seen mostly in the pub together, and they seem to tolerate each other. In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", he gets angry at Randy for insulting him, saying how his house 'sucks'.

Stuart and Gerald used to be best friends in high school, until Gerald started to get better grades, while Stuart's grades declined.

In ""[[Chickenpox]]"", [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] and Carol arranged a fishing date for their husbands, in hopes that the old friendship could be restored. The outing went awry when the two of them argued over their views on each other which eventually turned into a fistfight. They made up at the end of the episode.

'''Stuart:''' (talking to Cartman dressed as a cop) It's just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend, and our two kids. And my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob who I met last year.
Stuart can be found outside [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails]]. [[The New Kid]] has to destroy some trash in order to wake him up, and then the player can walk to him and get a friend request on Facebook.

Substitute Teacher,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Substitute_Teacher,,"is an unnamed teacher at [[South Park Elementary]]. She is first seen acting as a substitute for the kindergarten class, but continues to appear as a minor faculty member throughout the show.

The teacher is first seen at South Park Elementary in ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"" at a school assembly introducing [[Dr. David Nelson]] to the school. She has since made frequent background appearances in assemblies or meetings involving the school teachers.

She is seen teaching the [[Kindergartners|kindergarten class]] in ""[[Fatbeard]]"" during the morning announcements, but a new teacher takes over that class later that season and she continues to appear.

In ""[[Gluten Free Ebola]]"", she makes a frustrated remark that they are running behind because of [[Mr. Mackey]] once again, and the other teachers begin discussing his gluten-free diet.

Super Adventure Club,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Adventure_Club,,"is a pedophilic travel group featured in the [[Season Ten]] episode, ""[[The Return of Chef]]"". The club travels the world in order to molest the native children of the countries they visit. 

They are a parody of the Church of Scientology, with their bizarre and surreal beliefs, along with their practise of brainwashing new members.

The group was founded by [[William P. Phineas]] who was an explorer. Unfortunately, wherever he went he was always beaten by somebody else who had reached there first. He decided that if he couldn't be the first person to reach a place, then he could be the first to molest the native children. As he molested children, he discovered tiny things in children's bodies, called ""marlocks"", which would enter his body and provide him with ""immortality"" ""''so sayeth the ruler of Benthos''"", a mysterious monster only mentioned during the explanation. Phineas was hit by a train in 1892 which killed him, despite his ""immortality"".

The group is often confused with the Adventure Club. The difference is that that Adventure Club does not molest any children and only the Super Adventure club does.

[[File:TheReturnofChef102.png|thumb|left|William P. Phineas, the club's founder with several Aborigine children.]]
Despite appearing primitive and old fashioned, they actually have a good understanding of modern technology, which is seen when they resurrect [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]] at the end of ""[[The Return of Chef]]"".

The club only appeared in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"" which featured the boys trying to turn Chef back to normal after he continued saying suggestive, pedophiliac things which had led to a [[Detective Jarvis|police]] inquest at [[South Park Elementary]]. The boys discovered the club's ways and tried to undo the brainwashing that had been done to Chef. They succeeded, but the club found Chef again and hit him with a tranquilizer dart. Upon recapturing him, they made him choose whether he should return to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] or remain with the club. He chose the latter but was killed when the bridge he was standing on was struck by lightning, leading to several injuries. The club managed to salvage his remains and resurrect him as Darth Chef.

They are an evil organisation, molesting children without shame, due to their ridiculously surreal beliefs about the supposed supernatural benefits of doing so. They use brainwashing methods to recruit new members to their insidious club. Their threats against the boys are also amusingly empty and unthreatening in nature, as they simply tell them that security will escort them off their premises if they refuse to leave, rather than them issuing threats of genuine harm.

Super Best Friends,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Best_Friends_(Group),,"is a superhero organization composed of the leading figures of all the world's leading religions (and Seaman). The group is an obvious parody of ''The Superfriends'' cartoon series, a youth-oriented interpretation of DC Comics' ""Justice League of America"". They first appear in the episode ""[[Super Best Friends]]"".

Led by [[Jesus Christ]] of Christianity, the Super Best Friends is a group of religious icons (and Seaman) who go around the world protecting it from assorted evil threats. Despite the fact that the world uses their faiths as excuses for fighting and war, the members of the Super Best Friends remain just that - Super Best Friends.

In the episode ""[[Super Best Friends]],"" magician [[David Blaine]] begins to form a cult under his own name called ""Blaintology."" Among those he converts are the [[The Boys|boys]]. However, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] begins to grow suspicious and leaves the cult, only to be threatened by members of the group. Fearful for his friends who remained behind, Stan seeks out the help of Jesus. However, Jesus' old sleight-of-hand water-to-wine trick is no match, and they then call upon the help of the other Super Best Friends, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends. Together the group goes to Washington DC to stop David Blaine's followers from committing mass suicide in order to gain tax-exempt Status as a supposedly ""legitimate"" religion. In a climactic showdown, they defeat Blaine's trump card, a giant stone [[Abraham Lincoln]], with a giant stone [[John Wilkes Booth]].

[[File:SuperBestFriends044.png|thumb|Muhammad is shown uncensored in the episode ""[[Super Best Friends]]""]]
The group appears again in ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]],"" in which all the [[celebrities]] who ''[[South Park]]'' has ever insulted, threaten to sue the town if they do not hand over Super Best Friend member and Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]. However, a problem arises: since the Super Best Friends episode, it has become impossible for anyone, even the Super Best Friends, to show an image of Muhammad anywhere. Stan and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] managed to get Muhammad to go with them to South Park, in a U-haul, but are then forced to take him out of the U-haul as proof that he is really Muhammad.

They do so but dress him up in a bear costume in the hope that it will work. However, the celebrities and the [[Ginger Separatist Movement]] want to see him out of the costume in order to prove it is really him and not an impostor. However, Stan and Kyle made a promise to not show Muhammad to the Super Best Friends. It is revealed that [[Mr. Hankey]] suggested that they dress up [[Santa Claus]] in the bear costume instead, hoping that no one will notice the difference, due to the fact almost no one has seen Muhammad before, save for Stan, Kyle, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[David Blaine]], and the rest of the Super Best Friends. The plan fails, however, and the Gingers demand the real Muhammad be turned over. Kyle, remembering the incident in which his [[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig|elephant had sex with Cartman's pig]], suggests they try and get [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]] to clone Muhammad like he tried to clone Stan. This plan also fails when the Gingers kidnap all of them.

Later, when [[Barbra Streisand]] attacks [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], the Super Best Friends use their Super Best Friend cycles to get to the town. They defeat Streisand by having [[Krishna]] transform into Neil Diamond and sing a duet with Streisand. They then battle against the Gingers led by [[Scott Tenorman]] and save Cartman and a group of the townsfolk.

The plan consists of several stages of increasingly offensive, outrageous stereotypes and behavior to create chaos and violence among the PC bros, ultimately leading to the deaths of all the PC bros. 

The plan starts by using [[200 Pregnant Mexican Women]] to eat the tacos launched by the taco launchers, who then fall asleep and give birth to anchor babies. The PC bros would then be further distracted by a flood of Syrian refugee children, who would then be chased by [[Jared Fogle]], who is intent on molesting them.

Tad Mikowski,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tad_Mikowski,,"is the character [[Stan Marsh]] battles in a skiing competition in ""[[Asspen]]"". He often mockingly calls Stan ""[[Stan Darsh]]"". 

When Stan first starts learning skiing in [[Aspen]] and picks up fast, Tad antagonizes him together with two of his friends. Later he approaches Stan again with [[Heather (""Asspen"")|Heather]] whom he is now dating and gloats about having the girl. Tad then challenges Stan to a little skiing race, despite Stan being only a beginner, a little boy and even admits he cannot beat Tad. On the condition that Tad will leave him alone if he wins, Stan accepts the challenge. Stan loses the race. After that, he is approached by a [[Dorky Girl|dorky teenage girl]] who compliments his courage and invites him to dance at the [[Aspen Youth Center]]. 

At the dance, it is revealed that Tad's father is a rich businessman who plans to bulldoze the youth center in order to develop the area. Tad then goes on stage and sings a [[Stan Darsh|song]] mocking Stan. Tad foolishly mistakes Stan's annoyance at his song to be a request for a rematch. The rest of the teens, wanting to keep the youth center, make a deal with Tad that if Stan wins, the youth center stays. Tad agrees and arranges for the race to be held on the [[K-13]], which is considered ""the most dangerous run in America"". 

Tad easily leads on the race down the K-13, but stops to set up traps to sabotage Stan. He ultimately loses when the dorky girl shows up and flashes him her breasts, which turn out to be a pair of Kuatos from the movie ''Total Recall''. The distraction allows Stan to win, saving the youth center.

He later makes a small appearance at the end of ""[[Buddha Box]]"" where he, along with other skiers, are seen with [[Buddha Box (Object)|Buddha Boxes]] on their heads while skiing on [[Bunny Slope]].

Tad sports ski goggles with a dark blue band and orange tinted lens over his blond hair. His facial features include sharp cheek bones and a cleft chin. He wears a blue skiing jacket with light blue sleeves, red scarf, yellow ski pants, gray boots and uses purple skis.

Tad acts like the stereotypical rich antagonist from sports movies, ripping on Stan endlessly, despite the fact that Stan is a little boy and has just begun learning to ski. Stan also outright admits that he couldn't beat Tad, but these admissions are overlooked by Tad as he continuously harasses Stan to have a race with him.

Despite the fact that he could win effortlessly without cheating during the race, he uses numerous dirty tricks to secure his victory, such as pouring sand in Stan's path and chopping down a tree.

After the death of a teenager occurred after ""Oh Long Johnsoning"" at a batting cage, the talking cat was cited to be the cause of the meme. The cat was eventually arrested and caged up. [[Professor Lamont]] was sent to the facility where the cat was being held to reason with it, but was unsuccessful, as he interpreted the cat's vocalizations as a refusal to stop memeing.

This, eventually, lead to some believing that cats had evolved into beings as intelligent as humans. The [[Ambassador of Humans]] was sent in to try to communicate with the cat, who also interpreted the cat's vocalizations as a declaration of war, that the cats will continue to evolve and rise in power, that cats and humans cannot coexist, and ""Oh Don Piano"".

The cat is later present at the [[Colorado Republican Debate (2012)]] to debate against [[Mitt Romney]], [[Rick Santorum]], and [[Newt Gingrich]].

The talking cat is a black cat with patches of white fur.

Tardicaca Shark,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tardicaca_Shark,,"is a fictional fresh water shark species which is found in [[Lake Tardicaca]]. The Tardicaca Shark appears in the episode ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", where it was seen having intercourse with [[Nathan]] twice. The incident is frequently brought up by [[Mimsy]], much to Nathan's fury.

In ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", Nathan devices a plan to get rid of [[Jimmy Valmer]] from the summer camp with the use of a shark whistle to summon the shark. He instructs Mimsy to swim under the lake, then blow the whistle. Mimsy, however, took the instructions literally, blowing the whistle ''after'' swimming on the lake. The shark responds to the whistle and attempts intercourse with Nathan. Towards the end of the episode, when Nathan's final plan on Jimmy backfired, the shark returned once more.

In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' DLC [[Bring the Crunch]], the shark serves as a possible prey in fishing, and a requirement for a badge.
[[File:20180801032839 1.jpg|thumb|left|The New Kid being pinned to the ground by the shark's weight]]
The shark's shape and size appears similar to a Great White shark. They share the same fins and head, as well as teeth and eyes. However, it has brown/green skin and nasial barbels similar to those of a catfish. It purportedly has a 9-inch penis, much to Nathan's chagrin.

When [[The New Kid]] successfully catches the shark, Nathan will urge the New Kid to destroy the shark for him. It seems that Nathan can never forget about the shark.

Like [[Bob Johnson]], Ted did not have many prominent appearances. They both debuted alongside [[Mayor McDaniels]] in ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", where they encouraged her to use [[Kathie Lee Gifford]]'s appearance for publicity by decorating the town and holding school events.

In ""[[Volcano]]"", he takes over the intercom when Johnson is briefly fired by the Mayor for correcting her.

Ted wears a black suit with a white shirt, red tie, and gray pants. He has a receding, brown hairline and a small, brown mustache.

Though he never exhibited much of a personality, in many of his appearances he was questioning actions performed by others - such as the Mayor's reference to Uncle Remus, Johnson popping a ball for dramatic effect, or the destruction of the library, which would suggest he is more curious than Johnson was. He died trying to save the boys, certainly suggesting he was selfless and genuinely cared about the townspeople or at least children, as he was not particularly close with the boys otherwise. He also seemed sentimental, claiming he once believed in miracles when he became sad at Christmas.

In his further appearances, his role changes to a regular position as an abortion doctor.

Ms. Sanders goes in for her abortion. As she and the doctor talk about the procedure, a laugh track is heard, that is revealed to be the television. Once the doctor begins the abortion we hear the procedure's sucking sounds, which are accompanied by the hum of what turns out to be a vacuum cleaner out in the hall. The doctor gives the fetal remains to a nurse, who takes them and packs them in a box, to be sent to Alder Research Group.

Tugger shoots himself and ends up in the hospital, where the doctor just says ""Tugger needs an oil change and a new steam stack"". Overjoyed at this news, [[Russell Crowe]] gets his energy back and starts beating up people in the hospital, beginning with the doctor. Wally B. shows up late in the show and joins Russell Crowe on the tugboat as they all sail away into the sunset.

He teaches the mountain lion cubs how to perform an abortion, so they could abort the unborn Antichrist.

Mrs. Garrison shows up at a shoot for ""Girls Gone Wilde"" and shows off her new boobs. Later on she talks to some women at a bar, then settles on the redhead to ask her what could be the cause of a woman not having her period. The redhead's answer makes Mrs. Garrison think, which leads to her visiting Planned Parenthood to abort her fetus.

Ted wears teal scrubs which consist of teal pants and a teal surgeon's shirt over a white undershirt. He can also be seen wearing a protective mask. He has brown hair and brown eyebrows.

In ""[[Hell on Earth 2006]]"", he is said by a demon to have be one of Hell's most evil souls. He was given the task of picking up [[Satan]]'s Ferrari cake, along with [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] and [[John Wayne Gacy]], but the trio fell into a comedy of Three Stooges-esque antics, with Bundy playing the role of Moe. He is depicted as the most mentally stable of the trio and slaps around the other two when they kill people.

Later, when the cake is destroyed and they have to make a new one, they get into a fight. During the fight, he tears out Gacy's eyes with his fingers and cuts off Dahmer's tongue. He is then stabbed in the ribs then through the roof of his mouth by Dahmer, killing him.

He is evil and bloodthirsty, being a serial killer. He is also shown to be intelligent and sensible, compared to Gacy and Dahmer, realizing the need to fulfill their mission from Hell without killing the bakers of the Ferrari Cake and control his homicidal urges. 

It is possible he was able to control his murderous nature due to the fact all the bakers he was dealing with were males, whereas all of Bundy's victims were females.

</gallery>

Terrance has his own Rare card in the game, being a Ranged type. His character was also used during character creation, being seen walking in the background with [[Kevin Mephesto|Kevin]] in [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Mephesto]]'s lab.

Terrance Mephesto played his only significant role in his debut episode, having been quickly transitioned to a generic background character in later episodes. Terrance, along with his friends, [[Bill Allen]] and [[Fosse McDonald]], were apparently supposed to be the rival group for the [[The Boys|boys]] before [[Craig's Gang|Craig's group]], although playing that role in only one episode.

In his debut in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", he rivals the boys after [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] comes up with the idea of making a small elephant for the science fair. Terrance comes up with the idea of making a human clone to beat the boys at the science fair, with the help of his friends, Bill and Fosse. After showing the boys a clone of a live human foot, he turns to his father, [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]], in order for him to create a full human clone. The result is a dangerous mutant clone, which is released by Terrance after he opens his cage. After his father gets rid of the mutant clone, Terrance borrows one of his creations, the [[Four-Assed Monkey]], to show at the science fair in place of the human clone, and nearly wins the first prize before the boys present a pig similar to [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]].

Terrance never played a major role in the series after his debut, serving only as a background prop, however he still played some minor roles in episodes after [[Season Four]], such as in ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"", where he is among the students called by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] to help get revenge on [[Scott Tenorman]], and ""[[Raisins]]"", where he replaces [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] on the boys' football team during his absence.

After so long being used as a background character, Terrance was finally remembered in the two [[South Park]] games, [[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]] and [[South Park: Phone Destroyer]], although he was planned to appear earlier in [[South Park: The Stick of Truth]].

Terrance was planned to appear in the game as an acquired friend on [[Facebook]], but ended up getting cut along with several other characters. It is unknown what his role would be in the game. His friend icon can be found in the game files. He had the same eyebrow models from [[Damien]] on his icon in an old game build. It is also called ""Terrence"" in the game files.

In the quest ""[[The Many Asses of Dr. Mephesto]]"" Terrance is revealed to have been killed by [[Barbra Streisand]] in her attack on the town during the events of ""[[Mecha-Streisand]]"", with several of his genetic mutations being seen in his father's laboratory. [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Mephesto]] stated that he would let his son rest in peace when asked if he planned to revive him.

Terrance has medium-length combed brown hair and notably angry, ragged, spiky eyebrows, as well as a prominent chin. He wears a purple coat with yellow suspenders over a white shirt with a black tie, and orange pants with black socks. Unlike [[Bill Allen|Bill]] and [[Fosse McDonald|Fosse]], Terrance's unusual eyebrows remained after [[Season Four]], albeit in a non-permanent form.
Terrance appears to have an abrasive personality, actively seeking out conflict in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"". He also appears to be incredibly arrogant and self-centered; when his father warns him about the danger his clone poses to the people of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], he exclaims ""They're all stupid anyway!"". Terrance also disparagingly calls the other boys ""dumbasses"" and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] a ""plebeian"", showing his arrogant demeanor. Each of these insults suggests he believes himself to be more intelligent than his classmates.

In ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"", Terrance is shown to greatly admire his father for his inventions and praises him after creating a human clone for his science fair, though they fall out when his son disobeys him, releasing the clone after he suggested getting rid of it after realizing it was too dangerous. Mephesto however, still offers his son [[Four-Assed Monkey|one of his creations]] to present at the science fair.

Terrance is accompanied almost constantly by [[Bill]] and [[Fosse]] in ""[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]"". The pair are assumed to be part of Terrance's cabal, but they have yet to appear as a group since. Terrance was quite clearly the brains of the group; Bill and Fosse did nothing but follow him around.

In his debut episode, Terrance, Bill, and Fosse appeared as a group rivaling [[The Boys|the boys]], betting that they could clone a human before the boys could crossbreed an elephant and a pig. His group's role as a rival to the boys was usurped by [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and [[Craig's Gang|his gang]] in later episodes.

Although Terrance faded from prominence very quickly, he still makes occasional background appearances.

According to Terrance in ""[[Canada on Strike]]"", Phillip has diabetes, though this may have just been something to attempt to stop the strike that was going on before it gets out of hand. After parting ways on bad terms with Phillip in ""[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]],"" Terrance gains a considerable amount of weight and stays that way for several episodes.

In ""[[SUPER HARD PCness]]"", Terrance and Phillip were shown to have reached the age of a senior citizen. Terrance's hair is now gray, but the style is the same. He now has wrinkles on his face and sports glasses and he keeps his red shirt, but he wears a brown jacket over it. His pants are now black and as for Phillip, his appearance has changed as well. He has gray hair like Terrance, but it is shorter and he has more hair on the sides of his head. He keeps his blue shirt, but he loses his pants, exposing his light gray checkered boxers and white socks. 
[[File:Halloweentp.png|thumb|''The Terrance and Phillip Show'' Halloween Special]]
In ''South Park'', Terrance and Phillip are the stars of a popular television show. This show-within-a-show serves an interesting role; the parents of the [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] characters view Terrance and Phillip's obsessive fart gags in much the same way that many parents in the real world view ''South Park'' - with considerable contempt. Terrance and Phillip are ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' in the South Park world. Matt and Trey have said in the past that to them Beavis and Butt-Head were like ""the blues. It's the same thing over and over, but it's always good"". More evidence of this is the ''South Park'' [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|movie]] being a satire on the fire controversy of 1993 when a Moraine, Ohio mother blamed the cartoon for her son setting their trailer on fire killing his 2-year-old sister (Kenny lighting his fart on fire and burning himself to death). Mike Judge voiced an unhooded  Kenny at the end of the movie. Matt and Trey have also stated that the characters were in response to the critics claiming the show was nothing but fart humor.

Like most other Canadians, two characters have heavy accents, ostensibly to represent stereotypical American views of Canadians. The ""aboot"" pronunciation has also been used in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''Canadian Bacon''. The fact their career is based on an accidental fart Terrance made on the ''The [[Ed Sullivan]] Show'' at the age of six, because that was the only part of their act Americans understood, may be saying something about Canadian perceptions of Americans.

The duo popularized a catchphrase in the show-within-a-show, as they would invariably say ""You FAH-ted!"" and then giggle to almost any farting sound. They are the favorite show of [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick]] as well as most of the [[:Category:School Children|South Park children]].

Early episodes reference the show as airing on [[Cartoon Central]], a spoof of [[Comedy Central]], which airs ''South Park'', but newer episodes consistently state it as airing on the ""Canadian Network"". The Canadian Network cancels the show in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]],"" then reinstates it with Terrance, Phillip, and their wives, the Queef Sisters in ""[[Crème Fraiche]]"". This implies that ''The Queef Sisters'' was cancelled, because Stan and Kyle reference the show as ''Terrance and Phillip''.

Terrance and Phillip are huge celebrities on ''South Park'', and have won the Nobel Peace Prize. Some time before ""[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]"" they broke up but they were reunited in that episode. They apparently are so famous that they have their own line of dolls as seen in ""[[Cow Days]]"". ""[[Royal Pudding]]"" establishes that they are both Knights in Canada.

While it can be assumed that Terrance is heterosexual, Phillip's sexual orientation is, as of late, unknown. In ""[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]"", the following conversation is heard:

: '''Terrance:''' ""Wow, [[Scott the Dick|Scott]] really hates us, Phillip.""
: '''Phillip:''' ""Yes. Perhaps he's homophobic.""
: '''Terrance:''' [''pause''] ""But we're not gay, Phillip.""
: '''Phillip:''' ""We're not?""
:

In numerous episodes, it is implied that Phillip has feelings for Terrance. In the film, Terrance claims that Phillip had once performed fellatio on him, while taking a picture. This incident may have inspired Eric Cartman to imitate this in ""[[Cartman Sucks]]"". In ""[[It Hits the Fan]]"" Kyle also admits that the two kissed each other on screen.

However, In ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"" Terrance and Phillip marry the [[Katherine and Katie Queef|Queef Sisters]]. It is likely that Phillip is bisexual, although no official confirmation has been given to date.

The comedy duo creates tensions between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] with their foul-mouthed humor, especially the hit song ""[[Uncle Fucka]]"". While appearing as guest stars on Late Night with [[Conan O'Brien]], the duo are apprehended and placed under citizen's arrest by [[Mothers Against Canada]]. At the United Nations, the Canadian Ambassador and Minister of Media demand their release only for the Americans to refuse, but not before ridiculing them on their pronunciation of ""about.""

When the Canadians bombs [[The Baldwins|the Baldwin residence]], America declares war and orders Terrance and Phillip's execution. They are put in electric chairs at a USO show for all of America to see. But when [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] flips the switch, the show is ambushed by the Canadians. Though [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the other members of [[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]] save them by turning the switch off and trying to flee, they are shot and killed by [[Sheila Broflovski]].

When their blood touches the ground, [[Satan]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] enter from Hell to rule the Earth. However, Satan, tired of being abused, kills Saddam by throwing him on a stalagmite in Hell and Terrance and Phillip are brought back to life due to Kenny's sacrifice.

[[File:EatPrayQueef (156).png|thumb|The pair married the [[Katherine and Katie Queef|Queef Sisters]] in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"".]]
Terrance used to date famous Canadian pop vocalist [[Celine Dion]], and had a daughter with her. Their daughter, named Sally, is very close to her father and was an illegitimate birth, as Terrance refers to her as ""my bastard daughter"". Phillip's family has yet to be seen.

In the episode ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", Terrance and Phillip are married to the Queef sisters, [[Katherine and Katie Queef|Katherine and Katie]].

[[File:TerranceAndPhillipBehindtheBlow032.png|right|thumb|After temporarily leaving Phillip, Terrance becomes fat.]]

Terrance and Phillip can be found in Canada, where they teach the New Kid Nagasaki, a fart that can destroy solid objects with glowing green cracks. When the fart is learned, Terrance and Phillip will friend the New Kid on Facebook.

Terry,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Terry,,"is the Canadian Minister of Health and appears in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, ""[[Taming Strange]]"".

Terry makes an educational public health broadcast to Canadian teenagers about ""Canadian puberty""; however, he quickly learns that his knowledge of childbirth, which he got from his wife, is completely wrong, thinking originally that children were the result of a man's face being queefed on by a woman. He confronts his wife about this information, who claims she was being sarcastic and was angry that he never went with her to therapy. Later, Terry meets with his older friend, Rick, to talk about why his wife queefed on his face. Rick states that the reason has something to do with his new job as Canadian Minister of Health. Terry then calls everyone in the Canadian healthcare system, asking them if they're satisfied; this eventually leads him to call [[Kyle Broflovski]] about his little brother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], and later realizing that Ike had been receiving the wrong medication for several months. After having been very defensive about the Canadian healthcare system, he realizes that his hostile defensiveness of the flawed system has been the reason for why his wife queefed in his face. He then makes up with his wife.

Like the other Canadians, Terry has beady eyes and a Pac-Man-like head that flaps up and down. He has blond hair, a blond, split mustache and wears a black business suit consisting of a black coat, gray dress shirt, a red and white striped tie, brown pants, and black shoes.

It is later revealed that Parker and Stone are holding his mother for ransom until Gilliam makes a cartoon for ''[[South Park]]''.

Parker and Stone have cited Gilliam as an influence on ''[[South Park]]'s'' animation style.

In the sketch, Gilliam appears with a real-life photograph cutout for a head, as well as realistic hands, of which he has three. He talks by having his mouth flap open in a way similar to a marionette.

While Thad delivers packages in South Park, a misunderstanding brews from a drawing by [[Ike Broflovski]], depicting the ""[[Gerald Broflovski|UPS Man]]"" having sexual intercourse with [[Sheila Broflovski|a South Park mother]]. This misunderstanding causes all the adult men in South Park to incorrectly believe that Thad is having sexual intercourse with all their wives. This leads to all the men, led by [[Randy Marsh]], to brutally beat Thad up in an alleyway wearing Bane masks. Later, after the men blow up Thad's UPS truck and [[Wolf Home Security]] fails to act effectively on Thad's behalf, Thad jumps out a window of the [[Broflovski Residence]] to his death. The South Park men falsely then tell the [[Park County Police Force|police]] that Thad was a psychopath who was having sex with his own mother.

In the latter episode, she is constantly getting picked on rudely by [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]].

She has black hair. She wears a light orange, long-sleeve shirt, a blue vest, and a short brown skirt. She also has green hair ties, which she uses to put her hair into two puffy pigtails. She is currently the only known student to wear a vest.
Theresa isn't afraid to speak her mind, even when it might get her into trouble, and she has a low tolerance for rude behavior. Despite [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s advice not to engage with [[Heidi Turner]]'s teasing, Theresa insists on defending herself on both occasions. She is similar to [[Kyle Broflovski]] in this aspect. She  claims her family is progressive and has chosen to live in a tiny home to reduce their carbon footprint, and now lives on a block with other people in tiny homes, but Heidi accuses her of living in a trailer park and instead being defensive and trying to paint a better picture of her own family status and sugarcoat her family's lack of success, but as we do not see her home there is no way to know the truth.

The 6th Graders,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/The_6th_Graders,,"""[[Clubhouses]]""
}}
The '''6th Graders''' are recurring characters in the show's early Seasons and background characters in the current Seasons. They are students at [[South Park Elementary]].

The 6th Graders used to be recurring characters on the show in early Seasons, being seen as bullies and troublemakers who like to bully [[The 4th Grade|4th Graders]] and ride their bikes pretending to be motorcycles. In later seasons, the characters began to have their roles from bullies reduced to background students at [[South Park Elementary]], being used commonly in the [[South Park Elementary Gymnasium|Assembly]], [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|Cafeteria]] and [[South Park Elementary Playground|Playground]] scenes.

In the early seasons, only a few of the 6th graders were known, who passed through the role of bullies, with a notable [[6th Grader Leader|leader]] in attendance. This role lasted until [[Season Eight]], in the episode ""[[Pre-School]]"". Their new and current role as background characters started from [[Season Nine]], specifically the episode ""[[Erection Day]]"", which even added a larger variation of different 6th graders.

Despite having taken a background role in the current seasons, they still play slightly notable roles in some episodes, with the most prominent being in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", where they are seen watching Cartman and Wendy fight, and also having their classroom shown for the first time. This episode also added more 6th grader characters to the background, similar to ""[[Erection Day]]"", only this time with more detailed designs.

Despite having taken up the role of background characters a long time ago, 6th Graders still have significant roles in the South Park games, where they return to their roles as bullies.

They appear in the ''South Park'' game, ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' as enemies in various levels. They are the only enemy to come in two completely different types: normal and on bikes. The normal ones are average, deal 5 points of damage to the town and take regular damage from all towers. The ones on bikes are faster, deal 9-11 points of damage and are vulnerable to fire-works towers.

They appear in the alleyway between [[Jimbo's Guns]] and [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails|Skeeter's Bar]] when the [[Goth Kids]] ask you to find some cigarettes. They are seen smoking. The player then battles them to find the cigars. They are labeled as ""Smoking Scoundrels"" when being battled.

An unused 6th Grader model can be found in the game files. The model name is ""6thg_01"", so probably 6th graders would be some kind of faction, but at the end of the game they turned out to be enemies that appear in only one quest. The idea, however, was carried over to the next game.

The New Kid is required to defeat a group of 6th graders with the help of [[Super Craig]] and the [[Human Kite]] to gain further access into South Park. Afterwhich, the 6th graders will be one of the common enemies that are found across town.

During [[The Many Asses of Dr. Mephesto]] mission, some 6th graders are being subjected to genetical engineering, with several asses implanted onto their bodies. The New Kid is required to defeat the mutant 6th graders in order to gain progress into the mission.
Three 6th graders are seen smoking in an alley in the town, the player must face them to get their cigarettes and complete the goth kids quest.

The sixth grade classroom appeared in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", when the children are seen exiting it. The room has yellow walls, bluish green floors, roomier desks with green chairs and a history timeline on the wall along with other various posters and documents.

6th graders are notably taller than 4th graders, albeit short compared to adults and teens. Unlike 4th graders, they have a wide range of body shapes with different sizes. Starting from ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", a wide variety of new 6th graders have been added, with a more detailed look and feel that are more in keeping with the show's current animation style.

The 9th Graders,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/The_9th_Graders,,"'''9th Graders''' are teenagers who attend the ninth grade, they include [[Scott Tenorman]] and his friends.

They were seen reading magazines/books with him, and then they helped Scott make the chili with pubes for [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. They appeared in ""[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]"" along with [[Scott Tenorman]].

The ninth graders appear much taller than [[The 4th Grade|the fourth graders]], however, they are slightly shorter than the adults.

This kid wears black pants, a purple long-sleeved shirt, and a blue and gray beanie hat. He has brown hair and brown eyebrows.

This kid wears green shoes, yellow pants, and a long-sleeved, red hoodie jacket. He has orange hair and orange eyebrows.

They appear to be mischievous, and enjoy tormenting the younger kids, not by threats of physical violence like [[the 6th Graders]], but rather by outsmarting and deceiving them. One target in particular is [[Eric Cartman]], whom they trick into buying pubes by telling him that it would make him more mature in ""[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]"". They later attempt to make him eat chilli laced with pubes, but this plan backfires massively.

The Bard wears a yellow shirt, a belt, blue pants, and brown bardic boots. He has a green lumpy scarf that doubles as a cape, a brown satchel, and a newspaper hat with a long white feather and holds crutches.

The Bard sings this song in ""Song of Buffness"" to boost the ability power of his allies, as he is a bard. To ensure that The Bard succeeds in doing that however, the player must mash a specific button if he stammers. The first time he had to sing it is the attack on the Giggling Donkey Inn, in which The Bard is the player's enemy. During this time, he always succeeds in singing perfectly to his allies without any problem, but when he is one of your allies, he will always have problems stuttering while singing.

The Bard does not make an appearance until the quest [[The Bard]], where he is in possession of the Stick. He is the main boss of the level. He doesn't reappear until you are brought to the [[Elven Kingdom]], and only has one line. He again shows up when the school is being attacked if the player chooses to team with the elves. He helps you get inside with ""bard access"". Otherwise, he is only seen in the classroom. He helps in the attack of Clyde's Fortress and in the final boss battle, where he is one of the buddies that fight with you.

During the Recruit the Goth Kids quest, The Bard becomes an available ally. His standard attack is ranged, which allows him to hit any enemy for moderate damage. Despite lower-than-average HP, The Bard is a decent, all-around Buddy, and can help with his many odd special attacks, acting as a supporting cleric more than a fighter. Despite this, The Bard has no added perks which he can use in battle, and his basic attack can be weak later in the game.

In ""[[The Coon]]"", Cartman assumed the identity of the Coon to wipe out crime in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], but his idea of crime was flawed as he attacked a man he thought was a rapist when he was trying to kiss his date. In his regular identity, Cartman tried to spread the word of the Coon, even appearing as the Coon and giving the [[South Park Police|South Park police department]] Coon T-shirts, but no one really cared about him and the police were even annoyed by him when he went to report his ""crimes"".

One night patrolling, Cartman meets [[Mysterion]], who, like Cartman, wanted to fight crime in South Park, but was more successful - and popular - than Cartman. This made Cartman jealous and led him to try and get rid of Mysterion to become the only superhero in South Park. He enlisted the help of [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] and [[Dougie|General Disarray]] to get rid of Mysterion. The Coon noticed he was crossed out of their list of Mysterion suspects, and that his identity was on a list of people who could be the Coon, but this was only because Cartman is fat.

The Coon made a plan where Professor Chaos would make a broadcast about blowing up a hospital and Mysterion would show up to stop the crime, and they could catch him and unmask him to the public. Eventually, Mysterion does come and fights the villains, with Cartman coming unexpectedly and helping Mysterion fight the villains. After they run off in defeat, Cartman convinces Mysterion to unmask himself, but because of the way the characters are drawn, it wasn't clear who he was.

Mysterion is taken to jail and Cartman perceives victory that he is once again South Park's only superhero, but in an alternate ending, it was revealed [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] was the Mysterion that unmasked himself to draw attention away from the real Mysterion, and Mysterion comes and unmasks himself to Kyle, still making unclear who he was.

[[File:Coon2PROMO.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eric Cartman]] as the Coon and the other members of [[Coon and Friends]]]]
The Coon reappears in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"", where it seems he and Mysterion (later revealed to be [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]) have put aside their differences and is now leading a group of superheroes called [[Coon and Friends]], consisting of [[Toolshed]] ([[Stan Marsh|Stan]]), [[Tupperware]] ([[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]]), [[Iron Maiden]] ([[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]), [[Mosquito]] ([[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]), [[Human Kite]] ([[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]), [[Mint-Berry Crunch]] ([[Bradley Biggle|Bradley]]), and Mysterion.

He has converted his basement into a headquarters and has even kept Professor Chaos in a ""holding cell"" for 6 days, leaving him only with a bucket to poop in. He was seen criticizing Mint-Berry Crunch about the flaws of his costume and left him to guard the base during missions. He has also set up Coon and Friends alarm systems in his teammates' houses (without their knowledge and to the puzzlement of their families), to call them for meetings.

On a mission to stop a burning building, they get Cartman's mother to drive them to the crime scene, but the firemen try to back them away. Just then, another superhero, [[Captain Hindsight]], tells them the things they should have done so the fire would not happen, and despite not actually helping but criticizing the non-executive flaws, the firemen thank Captain Hindsight for his help, and leave, allowing 14 people to die in the fire.
[[File:Coon2Hindsight10.png|thumb|[[Captain Hindsight]], whom Cartman wished to recruit]]
This draws the attention of the Coon, who wants to recruit Hindsight to be a part of their group. Cartman, as his regular self, goes to Hindsight's mansion and ask for him to join Coon and Friends, but Hindsight says he works alone and refuses the offer. This angers Cartman, who then tries to blackmail Hindsight by having Butters dress up as Courtney Love and have sex with a random hobo with Hindsight's face photo-shopped on. Hindsight actually believes this ploy, which causes his reputation to crash.

Meanwhile, the BP oil company drills into the Gulf of Mexico and opens a dimensional rift, from which strange creatures emerge and terrorize the citizens. The BP (who later change their name to DP) decide to drill into the Moon to get rid of the creatures, but this only exacerbates the problem by summoning the Great Old One, [[Cthulhu]]. To help out the people in the Gulf crisis, the Coon is forced to go with [[Clyde Donovan#Superhero Alter-Ego|Mosquito]]'s plan to make a bake sale to help the people in need, which the rest of Coon and Friends agrees to.
[[File:Coon2Hindsight31.png|thumb|left|Cartman beating up Clyde and Bradley to assert his dominance]]
When they go to the grocery store to get ingredients for the bake sale, Cartman viciously attacks Mosquito and Mint-Berry Crunch in order to assert his power within the group. This causes the rest of Coon and Friends to vote Cartman out, who is later grounded by his mother for swearing and beating his friends up. Mysterion takes over Coon and Friends, and they go to stop the Gulf crisis with their bake sale. However, the Coon decides that his friends have become evil ""assholes"", and sets off to stop them.

In ""[[Mysterion Rises]]"", the Coon is trying to get to Cthulhu, but his flight is delayed because Cthulhu defecated on the runway. A little girl comes and asks Cartman if he knows [[Mint-Berry Crunch]]. This angers Cartman and he beats the girl up (in his mind, saving the day).

When Cartman does reach Cthulhu, he tries to get his attention by yelling at him, but the dark lord does not notice him. He eventually realizes he has to be sweet and kind, so he does that, by introducing himself as the little Coon, and petting Cthulhu's belly. Soon enough, Cartman befriends Cthulhu. They are then shown flying around, destroying various things Cartman hates, such as a synagogue, hippies, and even the entire city of San Francisco.
[[File:CoonvsCoonandFriends43.png|thumb|left|The Coon and Mysterion confronting each other once again]]
In ""[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]"", the Coon returns to South Park to get back at the other members of his former group, using Cthulhu's powers to banish all of them (except [[Mint-Berry Crunch]], who ran away) to an alternate dimension. He later continues his killing spree, getting Cthulhu to slaughter every last person at a [[Justin Bieber]] concert. However, in the aftermath, he is confronted by [[Mysterion]], who had escaped from his imprisonment by committing suicide and being reborn in the real world, accompanied by [[Mint-Berry Crunch]].

Unexpectedly however, it turns out that Mint-Berry Crunch actually has real superpowers due to his hitherto unknown alien heritage. He uses these powers to defeat Cthulhu and return him to his own realm, as well as save the other members of Coon and Friends. Stripped of his power, the Coon is last seen in the Coon and Friends holding cell with Butters and nothing but the latter's excrement to eat.

[[File:Coon2Hindsight01.png|thumb|A Coon alert klaxon sounding]]
The Coon's primary weapons are sharp metal claws attached to his fingers (made to resemble a raccoon's claws). He uses them to scratch up a man's face in ""[[The Coon]]"" (the man comments afterward ""ow, that really stings!""), and to beat up Mosquito and Mint-Berry crunch (they appeared to cause more serious injury, as evidenced by the large amount of blood on Mosquito). He also uses his bare hands to hurt his enemies, such as when he punches [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] in the face or when he kicks Mosquito in the face and groin.

He is shown using a variety of conventional equipment such as computers, binoculars, and TV's, all of which have coon-themed names and labels on them. In ""[[The Coon]]"", he also uses large amounts of dynamite to try to blow up a hospital, but abandons the plot soon after Professor Chaos ([[Butters Stotch|Butters]]) is defeated. While usually preferring to scale buildings for transportation (usually through the use of ladders), he is not above simply asking his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] (who he refers to as ""The Coon's faithful butler"") to drive him places (he refers to her car as ""The Coon-Mobile"").

He sides with [[Human Kite]], [[Fastpass]], [[Mosquito]], [[Super Craig]], and [[Captain Diabetes]].The Coon wears a raccoon-like mask with raccoon ears with metal claws, a utility belt, a red cape with a capital ""C"" on the back of it, a raccoon tail, a white shirt with a capital ""C"", and a gray jacket and gray pants.

Like his alter-ego [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], the Coon is deemed selfish, ego-maniacal, with a short temper, and wanted to be the only one with the spotlight, demonstrated as he tried to get rid of [[Mysterion]] so he can be [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'s only superhero. He defines being a hero as making the world a better place for himself. But in reality, the Coon is a villain.

He has a massive problem with concealing his identity - as Cartman, he is always going out of his way to promote the Coon and defends him when someone insults him (such as when Kyle called him ""faggy""), then accidentally letting his identity slip several times as the Coon, as he constantly gets extremely agitated when someone insults Cartman (Mysterion could tell he was Cartman from the fact that he said Kyle hated him, although he already knew by the Coon's weight)

The boys' evil doubles have personalities that are contrary to their regular selves; [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]] are mean and pick on [[Eric Cartman]], while Eric is polite and generous, which are the personalities of their counterparts reversed. [[Kenny McCormick]]'s evil double is said by evil Cartman to be wealthy and recently bought a new car.

Randy started off by getting a gig when a record producer saw him performing in his high school's men's choir. He gives him a chance to join the band which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his final year of high school, [[Sharon Marsh|his girlfriend]], and his family to go record with four other guys he never met before. He was aware of how bad the songs were, but because of all the things he was granted with due to the public loving the songs, he stuck to it. Their big hit song was called ""[[You Got It, Girl]]"".

When it felt it could not have gotten any better, their record studio had them replaced with the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys. All the riches he had soon went to rags as Randy had to move back to Colorado and face the mockeries of the townsfolk for being in a boy band.

The Llama Brothers,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/The_Llama_Brothers,,"are a Peruvian flute band formed by [[The Boys]] that appears in the [[Season Twelve]] episodes ""[[Pandemic]]"" and ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"".

In ""[[Pandemic]]"", when [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] is watching a Peruvian flute band perform outside his house, he finds out that they make a ton of money performing and realizes that him and his friends can do the same thing. They decide to purchase some instruments and costumes, but they do not have any money to do so, so they go visit [[Craig Tucker|Craig]], whose [[Grandma Tucker|grandmother]] gave him a hundred dollars for his birthday. Craig agrees to give the boys his money and he joins their band as well. The boys are then seen at the [[South Park Mall]] performing, but they find that there is a lot of competition from other Peruvian flute bands. They are then taken away by Homeland Security, who were ordered by [[Michael Chertoff]] to round up all the Peruvian flute bands and put them in a camp. They are interrogated by Chertoff because he believes they might be hybrids of Americans and Peruvian flute bands. They are sent away to Peru as a way to get Craig away so that he cannot stop the [[Guinea Creatures]] from attacking.

In ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"", the Llama Brothers are seen waiting in the Andes Mountains of Peru for a refueling truck for the plane to meet them there, but it never shows up.

The Orange County Crew,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/The_Orange_County_Crew,,"was a dance troupe that appeared in the [[Season Eight]] episode, ""[[You Got F'd in the A]]"". They are a very arrogant and obnoxious group of children who intimidate and laugh at [[the boys]] for not being able to dance as well as them, for no apparent reason at all, whether the boys are dancing or not. 

The OC dance crew challenged the boys to dance in the [[True-Value Hardware]] parking lot. Not knowing what was happening, [[The Boys|the boys]] were ""served"" by OC Crew. In their confusion, they went to [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]]'s house to tell him about the confrontation. Chef then called the boys' parents, treating the entire situation like a dramatic event. Back at [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s home, [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] taught Stan how to defend himself, next time, with line dancing to country music. When Stan, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] met the OC Crew again, Stan ""served"" them back by dancing to the song ""[[Achy Breaky Heart]]"" by Billy Ray Cyrus. The OC Crew then demanded that they challenge them at the OC Convention Center for a chance to be in a music video with [[Lil' Kim]].

Stan found a group of talented dancers for the dance-off, consisting of [[Michael]] from the [[Goth Kids]], a boy from an arcade named [[Yao]], a [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] waitress named [[Mercedes]], a dancing duck named [[Jeffy]], and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]. Butters is a tap dancer, who retired due to a tragic tap-dancing accident at a talent competition, in which audience members were killed from his shoe flying off knocking down several spotlights on them.
[[File:YGFTA67.png|thumb|left]]
With no chance of winning the OC dance competition, Stan and [[The South Park Diggities]] did their best against the OC Crew. When Butters began his tap-dancing routine, tragedy struck, again, when his shoe flew off, knocking the stage lights down onto the Orange County Crew, killing them all. Everyone cheered for Butters, but he was upset because of the tragedy happening a second time.

All of the OC Crew children are minorities.

[[Lil' Sheep]] appears to be older than the other children, as he is physically taller than them. He wears gray sweatpants, a black T-shirt, and a gray cap with his name embroidered in white. In the original airing of the episode his cap had ""Lil Shiit"" instead of ""Lil Sheep"".

[[Gil T]] wears pink jogging pants, a white undershirt, a pink coat, glasses, and a teal belt. She also wears a pink hair tie. She also wears a necklace and large, silver hoop earrings.

The unnamed Asian male wears brown cargo pants, a blue tank top, blue sweatbands, and a black and gray cap, similar to Stan's, but without the puffball. He also wears a silver chain with a medallion.

The unnamed African American male wears blue pants, a long-sleeved red shirt, a red sweatband, and a silver crucifix necklace.

The unnamed Latino male wears a green tracksuit, consisting of green pants, a green jacket, a red undershirt, and a green bandana.

The coach wears gold and purple pants and a gold and purple shirt, he has an earring on his right ear and has a mustache.

The coach is first seen when [[Randy Marsh]] unsuccessfully attempts to call off the dance competition. The coach refuses, and he ""serves"" Randy so badly that he ends up in the hospital. Later on in the episode at the competition, one of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' tap dancing shoes comes off and hits a row of stage lights, causing them to fall and crush the crew and the coach to death.

Despite his death, his character model is reused in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode ""[[World War Zimmerman]]"" as one of the angry African Americans in [[Eric Cartman]]'s nightmare.

In ""[[Titties and Dragons]]"", he dies once again, as he is seen as one of the many dead mall shoppers killed during Black Friday.

The coach has short flat black hair, black eyebrows, and a large mustache. He wears a purple and yellow outfit, white and yellow sneakers, and a round white earring on his right ear.

In most episodes, Mr. Garrison's class is referred to as 'the fourth grade' on an informal basis and he is often known as 'the fourth grade teacher', as if they are the only such class; but multiple episodes confirm there or are other fourth grade classes with additional students. Characters who have appeared in the classroom only on certain isolated occasions are generally not considered to be members of the main 4th Grade class and are also listed here.

In ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", the boys' class is separated into two different rooms by male and female students, with the male students using a different fourth grade classroom. The regular teacher and students of this room are not seen or referenced. The boys' fourth grade boys are joined by [[Nate]] and [[Boy with Red Shirt and Blue Pants]].

An additional fourth grade class is shown entering the hallway in ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"". It appears to be made up of the students who were in the main class in third grade but not the fourth grade, including [[Bill Allen]], [[Jason White]], [[Boy with Red Shirt and Blue Pants]], [[Brimmy]] and [[DogPoo Petuski]]. The classroom interior has not been seen. This is also the case in ""[[Back To The Cold War]]"" where multiple kids are seen exiting different rooms during a fire drill. 

In ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", Cartman mentions another fourth grade teacher named Mr. Bart (in reference to one of his students, [[Pete Melman]]) who may or may not teach this class. It is unknown if he teachers either of the above classes or a separate one.

A new fourth grade classroom appears in ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"" during the school's quarantine. The students seen in the classroom are [[Nate]], [[Brimmy]], [[Lannie]], [[Francis]], [[Tommy Turner]], [[Andrew Sutherland]], [[Monica Ryland]], [[Daniel Tanner]], [[Isla]], [[Theresa]], the [[Girl with Blonde Hair|girl with blonde hair]], and an unnamed red-haired girl.

Several other children are also known to be in the fourth grade but are not known to attend South Park Elementary. They presumably attend another school, do not attend school at all, or simply have not been seen at South Park Elementary.

[[File:Fourth Grade B.png|thumb|A second fourth grade classroom as seen in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"".]]
[[File:PDS88.png|thumb|Another fourth grade classroom as seen in ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"".]]
There are multiple fourth grade classrooms seen throughout the series, and at least three have been seen.

The inside of a fourth grade classroom is seen in ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"" when the boys are sent in a separate room to learn about sex education with [[Mr. Mackey]] while the girls stay in the normal fourth grade classroom. It has posters of sex education and a darker decor. 

In ""[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]"", multiple fourth graders (see above) appear to be exiting a classroom across the boys' classroom, though this room appears to house different grades in other episodes based on story convenience.

The new fourth grade classroom seen in ""[[The Pandemic Special]]"" has pink walls on which there is a board with U.S historical figures, a political U.S map, a clock in the middle, a photo with a spaceship, and multiple golden stars. It also has multiple bookshelves and a big cabinet.

After Stan and [[The Boys|the boys]] got ""served"" at the True-Value parking lot by the Orange County Crew, they went to [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]]'s house for advice on how they should respond to it. Chef called their parents to inform them about the situation. When Stan returned home, [[Randy Marsh]] forced him to learn line dancing, to Billy Ray Cyrus's song ""Achey Breaky Heart"", in the garage, so that he can defend himself next time.

The next day, the boys encountered the OC Crew, who attempted to ""serve"" them again, to which [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] dances back with the line dancing his father taught him. A crowd gathered and cheered him on, causing the OC Crew to challenge them to a Dance-Off competition at the Orange County Convention Center. The winner of the competition would win an opportunity to appear in a music video by rapper Lil' Kim.

Stan began to assemble a dance troupe of his own, for the competition, by first asking [[Michael]], who accepts on the basis of being non-conformist relative to his friends. Michael then suggests [[Yao]], who practices dancing everyday on the arcade game called, ''Dance Dance Revolution''. Michael then suggested that they recruit a girl, so they recruited [[Mercedes]], from [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]]. 

The last dancer they tried to recruit was [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who previously competed in the The National Tap Dancing Championship. Butters declined the offer because of a tragedy occurred at the tap dancing competition, which had put him off dancing forever. Not deterred by Butters declination, Stan and the Diggities were told about a special ""dancing duck"", named [[Jeffy]], who dances to fiddle music with references to illegal drugs. The South Park Diggities were to be trained by [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]], who believed they had a serious lack of raw talent.

At the Orange County Convention Center, the competition began to heat up as The Orange County Crew started off strong with their organized choreography. When it came time for the South Park Diggities to perform, each member took a turn dancing  until Butters' turn was up. Like the tragedy that happened at his previous tap competition, his tap shoe once again flew off, knocking the Klieg lights down onto the The OC Crew members, thus killing them instantly. The South Park Diggities were declared the winners of the competition, but Butters was still upset at the circumstances and tragedy leading to their victory.

After [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] found out that he was placed very last on [[The List/Trivia#The List|the girls' list]] of boys from cutest to ugliest, he decided to sit with the ugly kids at lunchtime. As Kyle sat with them, Jamal confessed his hatred of the school, and said he longed to burn it right to the ground. Kyle had the idea that they were not really ugly and that they are not portraying themselves correctly - but he soon found out he was wrong.

That night, Stan and Wendy asked Jamal where Kyle was, and he explained that he was going to burn down the school. Jamal plays a slightly larger role, as when [[Abraham Lincoln]] shows Kyle the positives of not being attractive, he takes him to Jamal's house were he is seen playing the piano through the window. Lincoln tells Kyle that because Jamal is not attractive, he must work hard to earn what attractive people get simply because of how they look, giving him character.

He has an overly large forehead similar to [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]'s. His favorite food is evidently pickles. He loves them so much that he constantly feels compelled to ask others if they are going to eat theirs. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the pickle kid is the way he chews. He chews his food in a slow and awkward fashion, moving his jaw in a circular motion like a cow (which is very unlike how most other characters are shown chewing). In the deleted scene from the episode, he steals Eric Cartman's pickle right off of his plate. He has a low and raspy voice that sounds dim and unintelligent. His voice also has a minor nasal quality similar to [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] or [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s. He was voiced by [[Trey Parker]].

Thomas,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas,,"is a boy who suffers from [[Tourette's Syndrome|Tourette's syndrome]]. He appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode ""[[Le Petit Tourette]]"".

While in [[Toy Safari]], [[Eric Cartman]] notices Thomas swearing constantly, giving him the idea of faking Tourette's syndrome. After [[Kyle Broflovski]] is deemed intolerant of people with the affliction, due to Kyle claiming Cartman to be faking it, he encounters Thomas when attending a meeting for people with Tourette's.

Thomas soon realizes Kyle was right, Cartman ''is'' faking it, so he later helps Kyle with a plan to stop Cartman from appearing on ''[[Dateline]]'' with [[Chris Hansen]] so he will receive more attention. Thomas and Kyle contact a number of pedophiles and invite them to the studio claiming it to be their home. Thomas welcomes them in, but upon seeing Hansen, they all shoot themselves, causing the audience to flee thus ruining the recording.

Hansen is angered with Thomas, but he replies with swearing which causes Hansen to leave. Cartman, however, is happy to have had the show canceled though, as he has lost control of his speech, revealing embarrassing secrets about himself. [[Craig Tucker]] then asks Thomas if he can be his friend, as he adores Thomas due to him being able to swear whenever he wishes.

Thomas has a light yellow shirt with green stripes and dark green trousers. He has dark blonde hair and faint bags under his eyes.

Thomas suffers from regular outbursts of swear words, primarily ""cock"" and ""shit,"" wherever he may be, which is not helped by his mother who tries to integrate him into society when he has a series of outbursts in a toy shop. He also has a very nervous personality, similar to that of [[Tweek Tweak]] or [[Rebecca Cotswolds]], and has black rings under his eyes implying he is very stressed and does not get much sleep.

He attends the [[Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation]] where there are regular meetings for him and other children with Tourette's syndrome.

Cartman was faking having Tourette's in order to get away with saying swear words with impunity. After Cartman whispered to Thomas, ""Isn't having Tourette's awesome?"", Thomas immediately realized that Kyle was right about Cartman being a fraud. 

[[File:LePetitTourette033.png|thumb|[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] with Thomas.]]
Thomas cooperates with Kyle in stopping Cartman's attempt to get on ''Dateline'' to spew anti-Semitic and vulgar messages on national television, agreeing that Cartman was faking the condition and giving people a negative impression of people affected by Tourette's. It is unknown how he felt about Kyle before realizing that Kyle was right about Cartman.  

[[File:LePetitTourette080.png|thumb]]
Craig seemed to think Thomas was very cool for being able to swear whenever he wanted. At the end of the episode, he asked him, ""Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?"" However, the pair has not been seen together since, nor has Thomas been seen at [[South Park Elementary]].

His first appearance was in the [[Season Three]] episode, ""[[The Succubus]]"", where he comes to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] with [[Nellie McElroy|his wife]] for Chef's wedding.

He made a second appearance in the [[Season Six]] episode, ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"". Chef takes [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] to his parents' manor house in Scotland. Thomas and Nellie perform a shaman-esque ritual to exorcise [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] soul from Cartman's body. Although they are successful in exorcising Kenny's soul, they are unable to re-seal it because Chef hadn't brought a victim child to sacrifice. Instead, Kenny finds his way into a pot roast Nellie was preparing.

His most recent appearance to date is in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", where he are seen along with Chef in a crowd during the town's Christmas celebration. He is not seen at Chef's funeral in ""[[The Return of Chef]]"".

He appears to be very old, with wrinkles and grey hair on his beard and mustache, his hair goes around his head with him balding. He wears a large blue unbuttoned suit with a black tie and an orange shirt, and black shoes. In a picture of his youngest self in his house, he had black and grey hair on the top of his head, a buttoned orange suit with a pink shirt and black tie. He occasionally dons a pair of black-rimmed reading glasses.

He appears to be friendly, being very accommodating to [[Liane Cartman]] and [[Eric Cartman]] when they visit their house in ""[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]"".

Thomas's main subject of conversation is the supposed encounters with the Loch Ness Monster. He repeatedly claims that they have seen it on multiple occasions, and are constantly harassed by it, as it tries to swindle them out of ""tree-fiddy"" ($3.50). According to Thomas, the monster has pretended to be a Girl Scout, an alien, and Chef's imaginary friend from childhood.

He appears to have a good relationship with their son, Chef, whom Thomas refers to as ""Junior"". Because he lives in America, Thomas misses him a lot. When he appears at their doorstep in Scotland he is overjoyed to see him again.
Thomas loves his wife very much. He consistently argues with her over their past encounters with the Loch Ness monster, and her pity for it.

He is incredibly tall (taller than most, if not all the other people of South Park) and somewhat fat. He wears a blue sweater and brown trousers. Under his sweater is a white shirt. He has orange-red hair, although he seems to be balding. He also has a protruding chin. In ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"" he wore a nearly-unbuttoned red shirt, pink scarf, gold necklace, a belt, and striped white pants.

Thomas has displayed an uncaring attitude. In ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", when Craig tells his family about the fight that is going to occur, Craig's father replies with an indifferent ""Oh"", not caring in the slightest, which results in the whole family giving each other the middle finger. However, he does seem to show some concern for his son in later episodes. For example, he is shown to be really worried about Craig's absence during ""[[Pandemic]]"".

In ""[[The Magic Bush]]"", he is really supportive of his wife and her privacy.

In ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"", he was happy when he heard Craig was involved in a fight, implying that he encourages Craig's ""bad boy"" attitude. Later, when he finds out it was a ""lover's quarrel with his boyfriend"" he is angry and complains about it, stating that homosexuality is something they did not accept in his times, and even though he recognizes that ""maybe it's not so wrong"", he doesn't want his son to be gay. Nevertheless, at the end of the episode, he supports Craig and tells him that he loves him. Even in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' he appears as a [[Yaoi]] amateur.

Craig is his 10-year-old son. In ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", their interactions do not seem to show that he has an even remotely close bond with Craig. He appears indifferent and uninterested in Craig getting into a fight.

However, he and his wife were visibly upset and were seen crying when they send Craig away, along with the rest of the kids in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], in ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"". In ""[[Pandemic]]"", after Craig goes missing, Thomas and his wife appear to be very worried about Craig and even sticks up for him after the other boys' parents call him a bad influence. In ""[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]"", Thomas and his wife are overjoyed when Craig returns [[Tucker Residence|home]].

He does not seem to have an incredibly close bond with his wife; in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", their interactions seem to show only a tenuous relationship between the two. However, they are shown consoling each other in later episodes.

Due to a lack of interaction, their relationship remains unknown.

The third and current model of Heidi's father first appeared in ""[[Marjorine]]"", where he was watching over the girls at [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]'s slumber party making sure that there were no boys at the party. He looked out the window in one scene with binoculars looking straight into [[Craig Tucker]]'s Binoculars. He then yelled: ""Ahaa! I knew it! Boys at the slumber party!""

Tiger Woods,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tiger_Woods,,"is a professional golfer and an inductee of the World Golf Hall of Fame. He appears in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, ""[[Sexual Healing]]"".

Woods appears in two forms in ""[[Sexual Healing]]"". He appears primarily as a video game avatar, for his latest golf-game, ''[[List of Video Game References#Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11|Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11]]'', which, in truth, is more of a domestic abuse fighting game in which Tiger Woods and his [[Elin Nordegren|wife]], beat each other up following Tiger's constant sexual affairs. The game is a big hit for the boys, who find the idea of beating the crap out of Woods highly entertaining.

However, when a group of scientists come up with the outrageous theory that rich and famous men are having affairs solely because of an uncontrollable source, such as addiction, the real Tiger immediately claims that it is the reason he cheated on his wife so much. He, along with a group of other celebrities, as well as [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Butters Stotch]], who are also diagnosed as sexual addicts, check into the [[Karne Institute for Sex Addiction]]. The Institute, however, does not teach its patients to control their addiction, but instead they teach them how to avoid getting caught again.

Later, President [[Barack Obama]] claims that sexual addiction is caused by a ""[[Wizard Alien]]"". Kyle and Butters later kill the Wizard Alien, who was actually a soldier who was willing to admit the truth about the ""Sexual Addiction"" matter, but was labeled by the government as a ""turd in the punchbowl"".

Following the death of the Wizard Alien, Woods and the other 'addicts' claim to be cured of their illness. Woods gives a speech saying that it's good that the sex addiction is gone and that he can be faithful to his wife. He also states that his wife would not have to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys (at which point his wife looks at him and says nothing, implying that she will or has already slept with other guys) and that he will return to golf.

His video game meanwhile has reverted to its original state, much to the disdain of [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Eric Cartman]].

Tiger Woods wears brown pants, a blue shirt, and a dark blue business coat. He has short, black hair and has black facial hair.

He is handicapped, uses a wheelchair to get around, and has a limited vocabulary consisting only of his own name and a small handful of other words and phrases, he is rarely seen doing this, however.

After a decade of being known simply as ""Timmy"", his full name was revealed to be ""Timmy Burch"" in the episode ""[[T.M.I.]]"" when his name was posted on the poster containing the kids' growth differentials.

- In ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", he and [[Jimmy Valmer]] physically fought over a dispute about Jimmy's comedy. In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", he runs over Tolkien and Clyde with his wheelchair.

</gallery>

One of Timmy's most notable traits, together with being the only child who uses a wheelchair in the fourth-grade class at [[South Park Elementary]], is his limited vocabulary. He mostly says his name and the slurred phrase ""livin' a lie."" It was revealed on the official site that the second catchphrase originated when Trey Parker said ""Livin' a lie!"" while performing as Timmy, after which the catchphrase stuck.[[File:Timmy2000096.png|thumb|Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld, performing.]]
It is said on ''[[South Park (Website)|South Park Studios.com]]'' that Timmy was born with a crippling condition,:''See: [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Doctor Timothy]]''

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', he is no longer confined to a wheelchair, though he still requires a walking stick to aid movement. His vocabulary has also improved, being able to converse without much difficulty.

Timmy wears a red sweater and blue jeans. His head is deformed at the top, and he has strawberry blonde hair. He is almost always seen sitting in a black wheelchair and is usually smiling openly and fidgeting with his hands.

During the metrosexual fad in the episode, ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", he wears a light blue unbuttoned shirt, gelled hair, brown work shoes and a purple-and-pink wheelchair with a rainbow band.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', he wears a brown jacket over a red shirt, blue pants, and black shoes.

[[File:CrippleFight114.png|thumb|Timmy fighting [[Jimmy Valmer]] in ""[[Cripple Fight]]""]]
Timmy was originally described as being somewhat mentally handicapped, but over time his character has become described less as such and more often as ""disabled"". In various episodes (such as ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"") he appears to be quite cognizant, intelligent and principled. In ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", and ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", he appears to have no trouble operating a computer, and in the former, he even comes up with a clever plan to get Jimmy kicked out of the scouts. He appears to have hydrocephalus, as well as involuntary movements.

Despite his disabilities, Timmy is treated fairly amongst his classmates at school. In ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", Timmy makes the top ten finalists in the boy's competition for their new friend, although he is disqualified, as [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] claims he is ""self-centred"". He is also used by the boys as a camera-man for their band in ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"" (which he failed at) and as a test subject for their time machine in ""[[Fourth Grade]]"" (which backfired).

[[File:Timmy2000049.png|thumb|200px|Richard and Helen.]]
Timmy has parents named [[Richard Burch|Richard]] and [[Helen Burch|Helen]]. Their surname is Burch (revealed in ""[[T.M.I.]]""), and they have the same disability as Timmy, in that they can mainly only say their own names, and they are confined to wheelchairs. They also have swollen heads. This implies that Timmy's disorder is hereditary.

Richard wears an old-fashioned red jacket with a white shirt underneath, and blue jeans. He has a crop of brown hair on top of his head. His head seems to slump down, a little. Helen wears a turquoise jacket and a lilac/grey skirt. Her hair is orange and shoulder length.

A picture on their wall indicates that Timmy, Richard and Helen have been to Paris.

Gobbles was Timmy's disabled pet turkey that appeared in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]"". Timmy bought Gobbles for fifty dollars from [[Bill Denkins]]. After overcoming various hardships despite their disabilities, Timmy and Gobbles formed a deep bond.

Timmy is friends with ''South Park's'' other disabled character, [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], who is able to understand what Timmy is saying. In the first episode in which Jimmy appears, ""[[Cripple Fight]]"", Timmy is intensely jealous of him and even tries to have him killed by giving him a parka like [[Kenny McCormick]]'s. Eventually, the two make amends and are shown hanging out together.

This relationship was strained, however, in ""[[Up the Down Steroid]]"" when Timmy discovered that Jimmy was using steroids to cheat in the Special Olympics. The two, once again, make amends when Jimmy does the right thing by telling the truth.

Being a highly popular character, Timmy has been received very well by the ''South Park'' community. It was seen that he is more popular among disabled people based on the voters who voted Timmy for ''Ouch!'' 's ""The Greatest Disabled TV Character"" poll.Timmy plays a small role in the storyline of ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and appears at the end of the ""Mountain Pass"" level to inform the player to move on to Downtown South Park for the final battle, along with [[Randy Marsh]]. He is in the same ""Medic""-type class as [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Tweek Tweak]] and [[Bebe Stevens]], moving quickly but dealing minimal damage. His special ability causes [[Timmy & the Lords of the Underworld (Song)|Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld]] to play and as long as it plays, any enemy Timmy touches deals heavy damage or dies.

Timmy makes a small appearance in the game, where he serves as a fast travel system. He only appears in a cutscene when you arrive at the bus stop and does not make a further appearance. He adds your character on Facebook when you find every fast travel flag. His only post is ""Timmy!""

Timmy is the appointed leader for [[Freedom Pals HQ]]. He has the ability to read peoples' minds, and has multiple speaking lines. During combat, he has the ability to brainwash characters to pit them against their own teammates. He develops a franchise plan intended to satisfy all members of [[Coon and Friends]], as well as his team so all characters may have their own film. 

He also re-appears in the DLC [[Bring the Crunch]] to assist [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] in looking for the counselors to help keep [[Lake Tardicaca]] open. However, he becomes brainwashed by the alien and assists him in defeating [[Mintberry Crunch]] and [[The New Kid]] during the final boss battle.

Toilet Safety Administration,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Toilet_Safety_Administration,,"After [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] fails to put the toilet seat down, his [[Betsy Donovan|mother]] dies, causing the government to step in and provide the TSA at every toilet, gradually increasing security and prominence throughout the episode. Initially, the TSA's only purpose was to install safety belts on toilets, but eventually, they started handing out citations for not wearing the belts, and provided airport-like security at all toilets, public and private.

The TSA installed cameras in all private toilets, which were monitored remotely and discreetly by a single individual. This individual was overweight and took advantage of the fact that he got aroused by watching everybody use the toilet. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] defied the cameras by bringing a gun, a baby, and a hostage past the TSA checkpoint in his restroom, while leaving the toilet seat up.

The typical attire of a TSA agent consists of dark gray work pants, a blue long sleeved shirt, a white name tag, a gold TSA badge, and a black tie. Some TSA agents wear jewelry and excessive amounts of make up.

Tolkien Black is a regular member of [[Craig's Gang|Craig's gang]] and is most notable for being the only black child in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], other than guest characters and [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]]. His name refers to the phrase ""token black guy"", a black man placed into a television show for racial diversity. His birthday is June 20. He is also known to be one of the smarter boys, being a straight-A student.

Tolkien made his first appearance in the series pilot episode, ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", where he appears as a background character. In early episodes, he was an unnamed character, however, in ""[[Gnomes]]"", his name was revealed by [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]].

[[File:Cartman and wounded Token.png|thumb|Tolkien after being beaten up by Cartman in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"".]]
His first major role was in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"", in which the boys were competing in a sled race against the girls. Tolkien made fun of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s weight by saying: ""Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!"". Angered, Cartman throws a rock at him, giving him a black eye. However, because Tolkien is an African American, the FBI assumes this was a racist act. Cartman is tried in a federal court and convicted of a hate crime and was sentenced to juvenile prison.

After realizing that they had no chance against the girls without Cartman's fat ass, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] go to Tolkien's house and ask him to help them get Cartman out of prison. The boys then put on a presentation before the governor, complete with visual aids, in which they detail their opposition to hate crime laws, declaring it as ""savage hypocrisy"".

They argue that all forms of crime warrant some sort of hate, and the laws serve only to encourage discrimination further, impressing the governor and securing Cartman's release. Cartman returns home, arriving at the sled race just as they are about to begin, and helps the boys beat the girls.

[[File:HereComestheNeighborhood11.gif|left|thumb|""''I don't fit in anywhere.''""]]
Tolkien had another major role in ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"". Tolkien is being teased by his friends for being rich. For example, he was teased by the kids of South Park for having a DVD player, and not knowing what a VHS was, or for having clothes from Armani Exchange. Tolkien, sick of constantly being teased, decides to try and blend in, going to buy clothes at the local J-Mart. However, the people at the store gave him and his parents strange looks, upsetting Tolkien.

After failing to blend in with the rest of the town's kids, Tolkien sings [[Why Can't I Be Like All the Other Kids?|a song]] asking God to send more rich people to his town. Soon enough, other rich people, including [[Will Smith]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], Snoop Dogg, and their families arrive in South Park. Tolkien tries to play with them, suggesting a snowball fight. Instead, the rich kids make fun of him and go off to play polo. Tolkien, downtrodden, says to himself, ""I don't fit in anywhere.""

Tolkien then goes to the zoo and asks [[Aslan the Lion]] if he could try to fit in with the lions, who inexplicably happen to be really into practical jokes and physical comedy. However, after he fails to understand the lions' humor, he realizes that he still does not fit in with them. However, in the end, his friends told Tolkien they were just ripping on him, which is just what kids do to each other, and that he had always been part of the group from the beginning.

[[File:ChristianRockHard067.png|thumb|Tolkien with [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], as [[Faith + 1]].]]
In ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", Tolkien joins Cartman's new Christian rock band, [[Faith + 1]]. Cartman asserted that Tolkien being black automatically meant that he would own and be capable of playing the bass guitar. Although initially skeptical and annoyed with Cartman's racial profiling, Tolkien finds that he is, in fact, fully capable of playing the bass to a high degree of proficiency.

After selling one million albums, Cartman is informed that he cannot achieve platinum certification in a Christian rock band, because Christian rock bands are awarded gold, frankincense, and myrrh as opposed to gold, platinum, and diamond. Enraged, Cartman yells, ""Fuck Jesus!"", angering both the Christian crowd gathered at the ceremony and Tolkien, who beats Cartman up.

In ""[[Raisins]]"", Tolkien became [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]]'s boyfriend, causing [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to fall into a deep depression. However, Stan comes to terms with his loss, flipping off both Tolkien and Wendy at the end of the episode. They appear together in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"" at the ferris wheel in the [[Jefferson Residence]]. As Wendy and Tolkien are not seen together on any subsequent occasions, it can be assumed this relationship ended at some point following the episode.

In ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", Tolkien is super pissed off at Stan's dad, [[Randy Marsh|Randy]], for saying the N-word on ''[[Wheel of Fortune]]''. Stan exacerbates the situation by claiming that he understood fully how the word was hurtful to black people, a claim Tolkien would never accept. However, Stan realized that as a white person, he will never understand how black people feel. Pleased, Tolkien responds ""Now you get it, Stan"", appearing to make amends.

[[File:Funnybot30.png|left|thumb|Tolkien could not stop himself from laughing at [[Tyler Perry]].]]
In ""[[Funnybot]]"", Tolkien was unable to contain his laughter at [[Tyler Perry]]'s jokes. Throughout the episode, Tyler Perry, as his character Madea, would continually make jokes that only Tolkien found funny. Each time this happened, Tolkien appeared disappointed and embarrassed at himself, but still handed the money over to Perry.

Tolkien reluctantly helped Cartman in ""[[1%]]"", who needed a place to stay safe from whoever was killing his stuffed toys. The climactic events of the episode unfolded at Tolkien's house.

[[File:SPFW17.jpg|thumb|right|The theme of racism often involves Tolkien.]] Pictured is Tolkien in ""[[Free Willzyx]]"".
Racism has sometimes been a theme based around Tolkien, such as in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"" and ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"". Since the demise of [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]], Tolkien and his parents were the only regular African-American characters on the show until ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"". However, it is implied that Tolkien and his family are more wealthy than much of the town's white residents, with Tolkien even living more luxurious than the other white kids who play baseball with ""pinecones and sticks,"" in ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"".

[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is the most obvious source of provocation towards Tolkien. When Cartman decides to make a Christian rock group, he immediately went to Tolkien and demanded that Tolkien get the bass guitar out of his basement. Tolkien, offended, responded that he did not own a bass and did not know how to play it anyways. Cartman shoots back that because he is black, he, of course, owns one and knows how to play it. Much to Tolkien's annoyance, Cartman was right on both counts.

Another incident of Cartman's somewhat racist behavior occurred in ""[[Quest for Ratings]]"". As the boys were making a news show, [[Sexy Action School News]], Cartman tells Tolkien to change his voice for presenting because it sounded too black or ""ethnic"". Tolkien does so and puts on an overly pompous white stereotype voice. In ""[[Wing]]"", when Cartman and the gang try to become Tolkien's agents to get 10% of prize money from a talent show he was entering, Cartman stated, ""Now you're probably wondering 'Hell, why do I need to give you guys ten percent?!'"" in a stereotypically affected voice.

In ""[[Imaginationland]]"", his codename is ""Blackie"". Occasionally, however, there are times where Cartman does something perceived as racist without the intent behind it, such as when he threw a rock at Tolkien because Tolkien called him fat in ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"".

In ""[[Free Willzyx]]"", while the other boys have their faces camouflaged black, his is camouflaged white. In ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", while working with [[Lola]] on the egg science project, he was given a brown egg while all the other couples got white eggs; and he understood what this meant and shot Mrs. Garrison an annoyed expression.

[[File:WithApologiesToJesseJackson079.png|thumb|left|Stan and Tolkien confront each other over what [[Randy Marsh|Stan's dad]] said.]]
In ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", Tolkien was deeply offended by [[Randy Marsh|Stan's dad]] saying the n word as an answer on ''[[Wheel of Fortune]]''. He eventually forgave Stan when the latter realized that he could never understand how it feels to hear the word from an African-American's viewpoint.

In ""[[Funnybot]]"", Tyler Perry makes a guest appearance as Madea for Jimmy's comedy awards, and Tolkien is the only character shown laughing at his jokes. This suggests a stereotype that African Americans are the only group that finds Madea entertaining.

In ""[[1%]]"", Cartman stays at Tolkien's house to hide from whoever is killing his dolls, convinced that since Tolkien is black, no one would dare attack him there because it would supposedly be a sign of racism.

In ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"", Cartman attempts to force a romantic relationship between Tolkien and [[Nichole Daniels]], believing ""black people should be together."" Although his intentions were insincere, the two do become a couple and were quite happy with each other.

[[File:ChristianRockHard024.png|thumb|Tolkien with his bass guitar.]]
Despite never having previously touched the instrument, Tolkien is shown to be highly skilled with the bass guitar, as seen in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"". However, he is annoyed by this talent, as Cartman tells him it is hereditary due to his ethnicity.

He also has an excellent singing voice, as seen in ""[[Wing]]"". He sang the Lou Rawls song ""[[You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine]]"" for the Ms. Colorado Beauty Pageant and won $200. Cartman also attributes his vocal skills to his ethnicity. However, he eventually lost his money when he hired an exploitative agent, and wound up serving drinks at [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s son's wedding.

He also sang a ballad, ""[[Why Can't I Be Like All the Other Kids?]]"", in ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"", but did not sound nearly as impressive as he does in ""Wing"". This is because his performance in ""Wing"" was a sped-up version of the original Lou Rawls track, while his performance in ""Here Comes the Neighborhood"" was performed by his standard voice actor, [[Adrien Beard]].

Near the end of ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", Tolkien rather easily beat up Cartman with two punches and a kick. This indicates that he is a decent fighter. In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Tolkien was seen fighting the other boys with some proficiency. He is also seen wielding nun-chucks in ""[[Good Times with Weapons]]"".

Tolkien also has a vigilante alter-ego, under the alias [[Tupperware]]. Although he is never actually seen fighting as [[Tupperware]], he and the rest of [[Coon and Friends]] try to intervene when cultists corner [[Mysterion]].

Tolkien is seen to be very good at sports, playing on the dodgeball team in ""[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]"", on the baseball team at first-base in ""[[The Losing Edge]]"", and on the basketball team in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"". In ""[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]"", he is seen with the soccer team.

:''See: [[Tupperware]]''

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he becomes a police officer, assisting his friends in investigating the cause of Kenny's death. It is shown in ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'' that he has been trained in martial arts, defeating two workers from [[Shady Acres]] who were trying to retrieve Randy back into the retirement home.

Tolkien wears a light purple Armani Exchange shirt with a yellow letter ""T"" and a pair of dark blue jeans. He is African American and has dark brown skin, and has short, black hair.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he is seen as a grown adult working as a cop. He had his hair grown with a full beard. He wears a dark gray coat over a purple collared shirt, navy blue pants, and black shoes.

Tolkien is usually level-headed, calm, and rational. He has also been shown to be highly intelligent, besides Kyle. However, this has caused Cartman to label him ""a smartass.""

He has a strong willingness to stand up for himself and his rights; in ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", he was incredibly upset by [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s dad [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] saying the N-word on ''Wheel of Fortune'', and did not forgive Stan until the latter admitted that he would never be able to understand the connotations of the word.

He was also annoyed by Cartman's constant racial stereotyping in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", but managed to contain his frustrations and continued to work with him. However, he eventually lost his temper with Cartman, physically assaulting him for saying ""Fuck Jesus!"" in front of a huge crowd of Christian fans.

In ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"" he took the other kids' teasing personally, causing him to feel like an outcast and not part of the group, possibly indicating that he is sensitive to social criticism.

In ""[[Free Willzyx]]"", he helped Kyle and the other boys save a whale, revealing a compassionate attitude.

[[File:HereComesTheNeighborhood017.png|thumb|right|Tolkien and his parents.]]
Originally known as Token Williams, he is the only minority (aside from [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]], a Chinese-American) in the main characters' class, and with the loss of [[Chef]], he and his family are the only recurring African American characters in South Park.

His name comes from the phrase ""token minority"", typically used to describe non-Caucasian persons thrown into small roles in TV shows and movies for the sole purpose of character diversity. In an intentional reversal of racial stereotypes, Tolkien and his parents are said to be the wealthiest family in South Park; his father [[Steve Black|Steve]] is a lawyer and his mother [[Linda Black|Linda]] is a chemist.

[[File:Craigsgang2.jpg|thumb|right|Tolkien as part of [[Craig's Gang]].]]
Tolkien and Clyde appear to be good friends. They are usually seen talking to each other in background scenes and both form the core of Craig's group.

Tolkien is a constant member of [[Craig's Gang]]. The two have only been seen talking to each other in ""[[Jewpacabra]]"" and ""[[Raising the Bar]]"".

[[File:Wing17.png|thumb|left|Tolkien with [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]].]]
Tolkien has been shown to possess a strong dislike of Cartman on numerous occasions. This is probably because Cartman does things that may be perceived as racist, though Cartman has refrained from using extreme racial slurs. In ""[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]"" Cartman throws a rock at Tolkien because Tolkien called him fat. In ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"" Cartman was together with some other guys insulting Tolkien for being rich.

On the other hand, Tolkien did agree to help Cartman with his Christian rock band, [[Faith + 1]], in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"", but only because he was promised money. Cartman believed that because Tolkien is black, he should both own and be able to play bass guitar instinctively. He was right, and Tolkien was even able to play it despite never picking up the instrument before, much to his frustration.

In the same episode, Tolkien stated that he was ""getting sick of [Cartman's] stereotypes!"" but continued to play for Cartman. After Tolkien called Cartman ""tubby"", Cartman privately promised himself that he would kill Tolkien. At the end of the episode, after Cartman said ""Fuck Jesus!"" in front of thousands of people, and called him a ""black asshole"", Tolkien eventually became enraged, brutally beat him up, and walked away.

Tolkien tends to side with Cartman over Stan and Kyle, as seen in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", the ""[[Black Friday]]"" trilogy, and ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

In ""[[1%]]"", Cartman comes to Tolkien's house for protection, although Tolkien did not seem very happy about this, especially after learning that it is only because Cartman thinks he will be safe in a house owned by black people.

In “[[Skank Hunt]]”, he joins Kyle, Stan, Butters, Clyde, Craig, and Jimmy to smash Cartman’s electronics when he was blamed for being the internet called [[Skankhunt42]].

[[File:SPTSW50.png|thumb|right|Tolkien with [[Stan Marsh]].]]
Generally, Stan and Tolkien appear to be on relatively good terms, often sitting and talking with each other at the lunch table.

However, in ""[[Raisins]]"", they experienced some friction after Tolkien started going out with Stan's ex-girlfriend, [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]]. Stan flipped them both off at the end of the episode.

In ""[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]"", Tolkien was incredibly upset that [[Randy Marsh]] had said the n word on national television; the situation was worsened when Stan claimed to understand how black people feel when they hear the word n word. However, their feud is resolved by the end of the episode when Stan understands that he could not possibly know how it feels.

Despite the feud between [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] and [[Credigree Weed]] (two marijuana farms which each of their fathers own) since ""[[The Big Fix]]"", the rivalry between Randy and Steve do not translate onto the boys. Both Stan and Tolkien are seen visiting each other houses, albeit with Randy's objection when Tolkien visits Tegridy Farms.

Bebe called Tolkien a ""midnight blue"" in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"" and invited him to her party. However, it should be noted that at this point Bebe was acting like a total whore and invited almost every boy to her party.

In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Tolkien and Clyde started liking her and thinking she was cool, smart, and awesome. However, Tolkien and all the boys were fighting for Bebe at this point, and all the boys thought she was cool and super awesome because of her breasts.

Tolkien and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] collaborated on the [[Faith + 1]] band in ""[[Christian Rock Hard]]"". They also talk sometimes and sit together during lunchtime.

In ""[[REHASH|#REHASH]]"", Butters talks about ''[[List of Video Game References#Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare|Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'' with Tolkien.

[[File:714_image-12.jpg|thumb|Tolkien and [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]].]]
In ""[[Raisins]]"", he began going out with [[Wendy Testaburger]], leading her to break up with [[Stan Marsh]]. However, it seems probable that their relationship was not as long-lived as Wendy's relationship with Stan, as they have not been shown together again. They were seen together afterward riding on a Ferris wheel in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"". He was also shown with other girls at the party in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"".

In ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"", when the girls are hanging out at Bebe's sleepover, Nichole mentions that Tolkien has a crush on her. Wendy comments that he is really nice and as such she dated him for a while, referencing their relationship in ""[[Raisins]]"".

Tolkien and Lola were paired in the ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"" episode and were given a brown egg by [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]]; a slightly racist jab at Tolkien.

The two can be seen talking to each other in ""[[Back To The Cold War]]"" showing that they seem to be on good terms.

Tolkien and [[Red]] attended the Bay of Pigs memorial dance together in ""[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]"". Red gave [[Rebecca Cotswolds]] a dirty look when she hit on Tolkien, but Tolkien did not seem to mind.

[[File:CartmanFindsLove034.png|thumb]]
In ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"", after being trapped in the boys' locker room together by Cartman, Tolkien and [[Nichole]] start to build a strong relationship, as a couple. To strengthen their relationship, Cartman planted a teddy bear on both Tolkien and Nichole's doorway. Assuming the teddy bear was by Tolkien, Nichole got upset when she saw ""Cuz blacks belong together"" written on its collar, which caused her to end her relationship with Tolkien. When she learned from Kyle that it was Cartman who gave the teddy bear, she apologized to Tolkien, who revealed that he was even avoiding her in the first place because she was black. As a result, the two reconcile their differences and got back together again. As of ""[[The Hobbit]]"", it is mentioned that they still are together.

However, the two broke up toward the end of ""[[Skank Hunt]]""; Nichole gave Tolkien the note while he was playing basketball.

In ""[[Dead Kids]]"" Nichole tells Cartman that they are trying to make their relationship work again.

In ""[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]"", Tolkien becomes tired of being an outcast due to his wealth, and successfully gets more rich people to move to South Park, all of whom are famous African Americans. At the end of the episode, the other boys tell him they tease each other for any faults they have all the time, and therefore they accepted him into their group. They then decide that from then on, they would tease him for being a pussy rather than tease him for being rich. Tolkien responds that he liked getting teased for being rich better.

[[File:Token1603.png|thumb|right|Tolkien in ""[[Faith Hilling]]"".]]
Tolkien plays no role in the storyline of ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and is one of the 'additional characters' unlocked at the game's completion. He is the same class as [[Eric Cartman]], [[Wendy Testaburger]] and [[Red]]. His unique special ability is playing blues music, causing damage to all enemies within a small radius of Tolkien.

""[[Gate Crasher]]"" is part of a main quest where Cartman asks the player to find Tolkien. He can be found in his home within the gated community. After [[Douchebag]] purchases a gas mask from [[Jimbo's Guns]], he is immune to the [[Security Guard|security guard]]'s pepper spray and thus forces a battle with him. Once Douchebag defeats the security guard, he can get to [[Black Residence|Tolkien's house]], where Tolkien adds him on Facebook and gets his equipment to continue roleplaying with the other boys. Tolkien is later seen healing his allies in [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]'s house and [[South Park Elementary]].

Tom Brady,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Brady,,"is a quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who has made a few appearances on the show.

Tom Brady has first mentioned in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode ""[[Faith Hilling]]"" in the form of ""Bradying"", a meme made popular by a photo of Brady sitting on the ground with his head lowered and his hands between his legs.

Brady makes his first appearance ''South Park'' style in the Season Sixteen episode ""[[Sarcastaball]]"" as one of the sports celebrities who endorses the sports drink [[Butters' Creamy Goo]], which is really [[Butters Stotch|Butters']] semen.

Brady appears again in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode ""[[Taming Strange]]"", where it was shown that he and [[Ike Broflovski]] had accidentally received each other's medications. He is shown crapping his pants during a game and then taking his ""Bradying"" pose.

He was mentioned again in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode ""[[Stunning and Brave]]"", where [[Eric Cartman]] says he is going to ""Tom Brady this thing"" after getting 4 days of detention from [[PC Principal]], referencing Brady's four-game suspension from the NFL due to the ""Deflategate"" scandal. Cartman later portrays Brady in a dream.

Brady plays a significant role in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode ""[[Turd Burglars]]"", where several people, including the press, try to get their hands on his ""spice"" to cure the C Diff disease by asking him if they can have some of his feces.

In the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, ""[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]"", one of the notes on [[Bob White]]'s conspiracy theory board reads ""THE SUPER BOWL WAS FAKED FORMER 'PATRIOT' WINS?"". This is in reference to Brady, who had left the New England Patriots to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020. It is also a reference to several conspiracy theories on the internet that claim Super Bowl LV was fixed in Brady's favor.

Tom Brady is among the several celebrities tasked to film a commercial at [[Pi Pi's Urineworld]] for [[PiPi+]] against their will.

If the [[The New Kid|player]] attempts to enter a correct door code to the [[Coon Lair]] without finding it in the game first, Cartman will chastise them and derogatorily call them ""Tom Brady"", in reference to the ""Deflategate"" scandal.

Tom Cruise,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Cruise,,"is a Hollywood actor who is a heavy advocate for the Church of Scientology. He is the main focus, along with Scientology as a whole, of the [[Season Nine]] episode, ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"".

He was also the main celebrity suing the town of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] in the [[Season Fourteen]] episodes, ""[[200]]"" and ""[[201]]"".

After [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] is told that he is the reincarnation of [[L. Ron Hubbard]], he goes into his room to find Tom Cruise sycophantically waiting for him. Assuming that Stan will recognize him as Hubbard's most loyal follower, Tom asks him if he approves of his acting. Stan however tells him he is only OK - not as good as [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], or [[Gene Hackman]] or the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite - causing Tom to break down into hysterics, and locks himself in Stan's closet.

He remains there for the majority of the episode, refusing to ""come out of the closet"" despite the attempts made by Stan, [[Randy Marsh]], the police and even his ex-wife [[Nicole Kidman]], all of whom assure him it's time for him to come out of the closet and that no one would judge him for doing it. He continues to refuse to leave the closet and at times, even refuses to acknowledge that he is indeed physically inside a closet, causing Nicole to respond ""Then how am I talking to you Tom?""
[[File:TrappedInTheCloset (88).png|thumb|200px|[[R. Kelly]] trying to coax Tom out of the closet.]]
Eventually, Tom's fellow celebrities [[John Travolta]] and [[R. Kelly]], try and coax Tom out of the closet, but end up locking themselves inside as well.

When Stan turns against the teaching of Scientology, informing its followers that it is all just a big scam created to get money, Cruise, Travolta and Kelly at last come out of Stan's closet. Cruise, Travolta and the rest of the Scientologists present begin yelling furiously at Stan for insulting their religion and that they all intend to sue him for slander. This angers Stan enough to start yelling back to go ahead and sue him.

[[Image:200_04.jpg|left|thumb|Tom Cruise is a total Fudge Packer.]]
Tom Cruise has carried out his threat against Stan in the [[200]]th Episode, when Stan along with [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], and [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] insult Cruise (again), by calling him a ""fudge packer"" (when he is physically in a fudge factory and loading fudge into boxes), Cruise becomes infuriated, instead claiming that he is ""fly fishing"". He becomes so infuriated that he calls together every [[Celebrities|Celebrity]] that [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] has ever offended, in going together on a class action lawsuit against the town.

His real plan however is not to sue the town, but rather get South Park to locate and deliver to them the Muslim Prophet, [[Muhammad]], whose inner-goo makes him immune to ridicule. When a group of [[Ginger Separatist Movement|Gingers]] threaten violence so they can get the goo, Cruise and the celebrities activate a newly rebuilt [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]] to destroy South Park.

[[File:EP201116.png|thumb|A dead Tom Cruise laying on the moon next to [[Jambu]] at the end of ""[[201]]"".]]
In the second part episode, ""[[201]]"", after the gingers captured Muhammad, they agreed to let the celebrities have some of the goo in exchange for the gingers being allowed to use [[Rob Reiner]]'s machine. Some of Muhammad's goo was transferred into Cruise, and he was censored. Later, when the celebrities were fighting the [[Super Best Friends (Group)|Super Best Friends]], [[Seaman]] jumped onto his back, and everyone made jokes about him having semen on his back. Cruise's censor disappeared, but the explanation as to why this happened was censored (It was really because that only terrorizing works). After he lost, Stan once again apologized to Cruise for calling him a fudge packer and saying that Seaman is on his back, and then he, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sent him to the moon where they still believed that's where the Zypods lived as seen in ""[[Free Willzyx]]"" where Cruise suffocated to death on the moon.

Cruise and the whale then make a cameo in ""[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]"" when DP is drilling on the moon.

Despite suffocating to death on the moon in his previous appearance, he somehow reappears in Stan's closet when you try to open it. He does not make a physical appearance, however, but his voice is heard saying ""I'm never coming out!"", a reference to ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"".

Tom Cruise is depicted as a relatively faithful representation of his real-life self, with brown hair and slight stubble.

In ""[[Trapped in the Closet]]"", Tom Cruise is wearing a black suit with a striped blue shirt underneath.

In ""[[200]]"", Tom Cruise also wears a fudge packing uniform while working at a fudge factory.

Delighted that he has finally succeeded in exposing the Tooth Fairy Scam, Foley orders his men to arrest the boys, but [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] appears wielding control over all reality, even becoming the half-chicken half-squirrel beast.

In ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", he had agreed to do an intervention. He also has been working at [[Lake Tardicaca]] and has been warned for getting high 14 times. His name (Spelled in Towelie) as TOWELYEY, though he was probably high at the time of spelling it so the legitimacy of this spelling is hard to confirm.

Towelie was addicted to marijuana, crystal meth, and crack cocaine, and tried using heroin and inhaling computer duster. Towelie has been sober since April 26, 2010. However, in ""[[Tegridy Farms]]"", it is implied that he may be using marijuana again since he took a job at the Marsh family's hemp farm, which might be the result of the events of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' which reference his rehab, but is seen getting high multiple times after his boss fight, where he is calmed by setting the store's weed stock on fire.

Although the creators of ''[[South Park]]'' intentionally made Towelie a terrible character, he gained a huge amount of popularity. After his [[Towelie|initial appearance]], he took on parts, usually cameos, in other episodes. In spite of this, he is regarded as ""the worst character ever"" by other characters within the show.

Towelie is probably best described as an anthropomorphic light-blue towel with arms, legs, and a face. He wears tiny yellow shoes and speaks in a high-pitched voice with an apparent slight southern accent. His eyes become visibly bloodshot when he gets high. In ""[[Crippled Summer]]"", he is shown crumpled and burnt at the edges, due to his drug addiction. In ""[[Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special]]"" he appears green for St. Patrick's Day.

Towelie clearly wants to get high at all times; he doesn't hesitate to get high in public and suggesting the kids and everyone to get high as well. He prefers smoking weed but often (as in ""Crippled Summer"") uses crack and/or meth and other drugs possibly. When he is not high he gets in an awful mood and can become rude. On such occasions where he is out of dope and money, he prostitutes himself to old men by providing oral sex in exchange for money in order to buy more drugs and get high again.

Despite the fact he is an addict, he is genuinely a mild persona often exhibiting sensitivity and kindness. He seldom becomes aggressive and usually due to being out of dope, or when people throw away his dope either by accident or to protect him. Towelie is also, by nature, very caring of others. He saved the boys' lives in his debut and constantly reminds people to use towels after getting wet so as not to catch a cold. Towelie's love for his son was the driving force behind him getting clean. Furthermore, he also carries some moral standards such as when he called out Randy for his greed by pandering to the Chinese government, selling out to big businesses such as MedMen, and destroying people's homegrown weed.  

[[File:Washcloth.png|thumb|left|Towelie's girlfriend, [[Rebecca (Towelie's Girlfriend)|Rebecca]], and his son, [[Washcloth]].]]
Towelie is shown in the episode ""[[Crippled Summer]]"" to have a family. It consists of his girlfriend named [[Rebecca (Towelie's Girlfriend)|Rebecca]], whose face was blurred out, and their son together, named [[Washcloth]].

Rebecca kicked Towelie out for being a bad influence on their son, preventing him from speaking to Washcloth when he was high. The boys use Washcloth as an incentive to get Towelie to get treatment. Towelie, Rebecca, and Washcloth later moved back in together after Towelie kicked his addiction.

Towelie appears on one of the loading screens, while being high, pointing at the game tip, which always says: ""Don't forget to bring a towel"".

Towelie appears in [[Medicinal Fried Fiasco]], as a budtender at the [[Medicinal Fried Chicken (Location)|Medicinal Fried Chicken]], having given up getting high. [[The New Kid]] must get [[Classi]]'s prescription from him.

However, Towelie has become easily enraged due to the loss of drugs, for a trivial reason, he engaged in combat with the New Kid and the Coon. After the kids managed to burn the weed piles in the store, Towelie calmed down and gave the kids what they wanted.

Towelie can also be seen as an assistance provider in the [[Towelie: Your Gaming Bud]] downloadable content.

As shown in a trailer, Towelie could have had a role playing as a mage assisting the boys in their quest of locating a dark sorcerer. This was cut as it did not make it into the final production.

Travis Mayfield,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Travis_Mayfield,,"is a head louse who lived in [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s hair in the [[Season Eleven]] episode ""[[Lice Capades]]"".

Travis was married to [[Kelly Mayfield]]. Shown to be some kind of researcher, he tells everyone in his lice colony that they have to move elsewhere because the ""world"" has become aware of them, but is ignored.

Travis, along with his unborn baby Hope, another female louse, and the [[Vice President Greg|Vice President]] go to ""the forbidden zone"", the back of Clyde's neck. When they reach ""The Forbidden Zone"" the vice president shoots the female in the head and shoots Travis in the legs. He then reveals his plan to go back, rebuild and become president. However, the Vice President dies when he shoots Clyde's neck with his gun, prompting Clyde to reach back and flick him away.

Travis is eventually saved by a fly that takes him to live with a population of pubic lice in [[Angelina Jolie]]'s pubic hair.

Being a louse, Travis has six limbs, each ending in a claw and opposing thumb; four limbs are used as hands and the last two are used as hind legs when standing upright. He has a thorax that is separated into several fused segments and a separate abdomen. He has two antennae, a full head of black hair and eyebrows, and a pair of pincer-like mouth parts.

Travis Mayfield is shown to be very loving and caring towards his family. His loyalty towards his family is shown even more when another louse tried to get into a relationship with him, he replied ""Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name Kelly."" He is also shown to be very heroic as he will journey into ""The Forbidden Zone"" to find another ""planet"".

Trent Boyett,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Trent_Boyett,,"is a bully and a former classmate of [[The Boys|the boys]] who appears as the main antagonist in the [[Season Eight]] episode, ""[[Pre-School]]"".

Boyett beat up Butters and [[The 6th Graders|the 6th graders]]. He gave them massive snuggies, wet willies, Indian sunburns, a Polish Bike Ride, a Texas Chili Bowl, a charlie horse on the thigh, second-degree titty twisters, a colossal swirly, head damage, and a noogie.
*'''Attempted Assault:''' Boyett tried to beat up the boys, but failed when Cartman fired a taser gun, but missed and hit Ms. Claridge charging her up and making her chair go out of control on a rampage.
*'''Implied Sexual Assault:''' Boyett gave at least one of the 6th graders a Texas Chili Bowl, which a doctor said involved Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus. If Boyett penetrated the 6th grader with a telephone, and/or pour Tabasco sauce down his anus, or penetrate him with the bottle, this would classify as sexual assault and therefore make Boyett a rapist.

Trent was very foul-mouthed and considered the ""toughest, baddest"" kid in the pre-school class. [[The Boys|The boys]] had wanted to play ""Firemen"", which involved urinating on a fire to put it out. They asked Trent to burn something for them, which he agreed to, as he burned ""a lot of stuff"".

When the boys failed to put out the fire, it spread and set their teacher, [[Miss Claridge]], on fire. The resultant burns were so severe that Ms. Claridge would be confined to an electronic wheelchair and could only communicate by beeping once for ""yes"" and twice for ""no"".

Trent tried to tell the police that it was the boys' fault, but the boys and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], who didn't want to get grounded for being involved, denied it and lied that it was solely Trent's fault, causing Trent to be sent to Juvenile Hall for five years. As he was being taken away, he swore revenge.

The day he was released from prison, he went straight after Butters, giving him a wedgie so massive it nearly killed him, two ""Indian sunburns"", a ""charlie horse"", a ""titty-twister"", a ""swirly"", a ""noogie"", and a ""Polish bike ride"", causing Butters to wind up hospitalized.

The boys later enlisted the help of [[The 6th Graders|the sixth graders]] to defend them, but Trent overpowered all of them, even giving one of them a ""Texas Chili Bowl"", involving Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus, sending them all the hospital badly injured.

The boys then tried to get the help of [[Shelly Marsh|Shelly]] next, but she forced them to confess what they did before she would protect them, seeing as how bullying [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] was her job. As they were about to admit their involvement to Ms. Claridge, Trent arrived to enact his revenge on them. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] grabbed the taser he had swiped from his mom, trying to keep Trent away from them, but he shot and missed Trent, accidentally hitting Ms. Claridge's wheelchair and giving it such an electric charge that it was sent out of control, ultimately causing her to get seriously burned once again.

History repeated itself when Trent once again tried to tell the police of the boys' involvement, only to be carted off to Juvenile Hall for another five years, after a misunderstanding of Ms. Claridge's response: after beeping twice, the police officer misinterpreted it as ""Yes, yes"".

Trent had short, wild blond hair, and wore a black muscle shirt, a tattered red vest, a gold chain necklace, and black pants. He had a tattoo on each shoulder, the left one a skull with ""Never Forget"", and the right one across with ""Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the lord"". He also carried around a switchblade with ""Kill all betrayers"" scrawled on it. He appears to have a nasty-looking glare when vengeful. He always wears his iconic frown and has a pout. Trent is double-chinned and appears to be slightly overweight.

As a pre-schooler, he wore a similar outfit but had an aquamarine sweater with a picture of a truck on it underneath the vest.
Even in pre-school, he used extremely foul language and was seen bullying another boy for no known reason. Although Trent always had an abrasive disposition, five years wrongfully spent in prison seems to have hardened him and his resolve.

After his release, he was extremely driven by his hatred of the boys, seeking them out and stopping at nothing for his revenge. Butters' attempts at reasoning with him were futile, as were the boys' pleadings at the end of the episode. He is completely ruthless, exacting punishments of extreme brutality on all of his victims. At one point, the doctor remarks, ""I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side"".

Tuong Lu Kim,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tuong_Lu_Kim,,"is an alter ego of [[William Janus|Dr. William Janus]] and the owner of the local [[City Wok]] restaurant and [[City Airlines]]. His stereotypical Chinese accent is used for humor, causing him to mispronounce words such as 'city' as 'shitty'. He debuted in ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"" and has remained a recurring character since, though his true identity was not revealed until ""[[City Sushi]]"".

</gallery>

In ""[[Jared Has Aides]]"", [[the boys]] prank-call him, then approach him about Butters becoming City Wok's ""[[Jared Fogle|Jared]]"". After the real Jared announces he has ""aides"", Lu Kim decides he doesn't want his own ""Jared"" and the kids become angry with him. At the end of the episode, after everyone discovers the difference, he offers the boys $15 (pronounced ""fifteen dorra"") and the boys refuse. 

Later in ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", he is asked to build a wall around the town to protect the city from kidnappers (and [[Mongolians]] raiding the town for no apparent reason other than to be an inconvenience to Lu Kim). Lu Kim expresses great frustration but ultimately fails his goal, becoming even angrier when [[Mayor McDaniels]] requests he ""tear down this wall"".

In ""[[It's Christmas in Canada]]"", the boys contact him via ""City Airlines"" in hopes of going to Canada to rescue [[Ike Broflovski|Kyle's brother]] and speak with [[Saddam Hussein|the Prime Minister of Canada]]. They haggle him down to $62 (although Lu Kim thinks that he haggled them instead) to take the four of them to Canada. During the flight, his Cessna runs out of gas and crashes, but not before he jumps from the plane with the only parachute. It is unknown how he managed to get out of Canada and back to South Park, though presumably, he followed the only road back. 

He reappears in ""[[Wing]]"" briefly where he introduced the boys to his wife, [[Wing Han Tsang|Wing]]. Later, the Chinese Mafia arrives at City Wok and forces him (by dumping trays of his food over the counter) to tell where Wing is. Lu Kim then appears at the end of the wedding. 

Tuong Lu Kim can also be seen in the crowd at the end of the episode ""[[The Coon]]"".

He reappears in ""[[T.M.I.]]"" where he, along with a group of Anger Management people who are mad about the sizes of their penises. Just a few episodes later in ""[[City Sushi]]"" however, he reappears angry that City Wok now has competition with City Sushi right next door. He is shown to have a deep hatred for Japanese people, consistently trying to kill [[Junichi Takiyama|the City Sushi owner]] and humiliate him, proposing peace treaties including an Asian Diversity assembly at the school and then an Asian Diversity festival, using a [[Tower of Peace|peace tower]] at the latter plot in hopes of killing the owner and framing it as a suicide (which he claims is what Japanese people like doing most).

Meanwhile, [[Butters Stotch]] is seeing a psychologist named Dr. Janus for Dissociative Identity Disorder (referred to in the episode as Multiple Personality Disorder) though he quickly discovers Janus suffers from the disorder himself. Dr. Janus soon begins to haunt Butters because of this through several personalities. He even frames Butters for bedwetting and bank robbery. Janus' young boy personality (""Billy"") asks Butters to help him stop an evil personality and leads him to his mansion where Butters discovers Janus has photographs of Takiyama labeled 'Kill'. It is then revealed Dr. Janus is Tuong Lu Kim, and Lu Kim is only a personality and the strongest personality of Janus. At the Tower of Peace, he reveals his plan to Takiyama and tries to kill him but the police arrive and reveal to him that he's not Chinese but white. Lu Kim and Takiyama appear clueless at first but when Lu Kim begins changing between personalities, Takiyama is ashamed that he believed that a white man was Chinese and kills himself by jumping off the tower.

After Lu Kim is arrested, [[Sergeant Yates]] resolves they should let Janus keep believing he is a Chinese man, not telling him about his disorder, and send him back to his restaurant after he gets processed, rather than keep him arrested, explaining City Wok is the only Asian restaurant after the incident and it will get more money anyway and he would be harmless as such. In his cell, he is continuing to plot to kill any more Japanese people who try to ruin his restaurant's business, thinking they are probably watching him but Lu Kim decides he will try to act harmless.

As of ""[[Cock Magic]]"", it has been shown that Lu Kim has been released from prison and is back to normal, although the town seems to be aware of his true nature, as it is referenced by [[PC Principal]] in ""[[Stunning and Brave]]"" to little surprise or reaction.

Tuong Lu Kim wears a white collared shirt with a red bow tie, an orange City Wok vest, and blue pants. He also has a gold watch in his right hand. His hair is black and has a comb-over to hide his balding. He has one tooth sticking out from his mouth when it is closed and he has lines defining his cheeks and chin. His eyes are almost always closed due to the stereotype seen in the series that Asians always have small eyes, but are occasionally seen open.

From [[Season Fifteen]]'s ""[[City Sushi]]"" on, his vest is straightened out a bit and he now wears dark gray pants. His hairline is slightly modified and his cheekbones and chin are now an off-flesh color instead of black, like many other characters in later seasons; he occasionally reverts to his previous design.

Although its canonicity is disputed, Lu Kim plays a major role in the video game [[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]] as an assistant in the ""Great Wall"" level where [[Child Abduction is Not Funny|he is once again asked to build a wall around the town]] to keep out enemies. He pours hot sauce over parts of the level at random times that can damage enemies heavily. He is not a playable character.

City Wok, City Sushi, and the Tower of Peace appear prominently as locations in this game. Lu Kim's store is taken over by [[Mongolians]] who force him to sell Mongolian beef and live in the Tower of Peace constructed during ""[[City Sushi]]"". He dispenses 'potions' and power-ups at his store and adds [[Douchebag|your character]] as a friend on [[Facebook]] if you complete a quest for him against the Mongolians. He can also be summoned into battle to do his battle dance to instantly win any encounter apart from boss battles, but only once per day.

He is mostly used as a background character after leaving The Boys group in Season Six but continues to make frequent appearances and have speaking roles in the series from time to time. He is still in the extended group, [[Coon and Friends]].

Beginning with ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"", Tweek is allegedly in a relationship with [[Craig Tucker]]. In ""[[Wieners Out]]"", Butters refers to the two as a gay couple when encouraging his male peers to join his movement. Despite their relationship being forced at the start, the two stay together of their own free will and are now more open about their sexualities and their relationship. In ""[[Put It Down]]"", [[Craig Tucker]] refers to Tweek as ""honey"" and ""babe"" even when not in front of other people. Assuming this means that they are actually in a relationship and they are not faking for publicity. This is further shown with them as adults in the future, where they still spend the most time together and are inferred to still be together. 

In ""Put It Down"", Tweek is shown to be able to play the piano. At the start of the episode, due to him panicking, he was just hitting the keys and screaming, however, during the final song, Tweek is shown to play the piano very well.

Tweek has messy blond hair and wears an incorrectly-buttoned, navy-green coat with blue pants. In ""[[Gnomes]]"", his physical appearance was slightly different from more recent episodes; instead of a green collar, he had a black one, wears an undershirt, and his jeans were also of a darker color. During the metrosexual fad in ""[[South Park is Gay!]]"", he appeared in a pink track jacket with slicked down, tinted hair along with lowlights.

In ""[[T.M.I.]]"", it is shown that he has grown 1.9 inches since the last physical and with a penis length of 1.45 inches. According to the list made in the episode, Tweek probably has the smallest penis size among the boys besides [[Eric Cartman]], although it cannot be certain due to Chris Andrews' being covered by Craig's arm when posting it on the wall of the school hall with Clyde, meaning it might be the third smallest.

In ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Tweek appears as an adult man. He still has messy blonde hair, although it is longer than it used to be. He also has slightly sunken cheeks and eye bags, blond eyebrows, a nose, a white undershirt, blue pants, gray trekking shoes, and a similar sleeved-up green coat, this time properly buttoned up.

[[File:FreeHat03.jpg|thumb|Tweek finding his center.]]
Tweek is rarely seen smiling or expressing positive emotions, being almost constantly on the verge of outright panic. He is usually seen gritting his teeth or generally flipping out. He also appears to be easily manipulated, making him a frequent pawn of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s plots (""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", ""[[Free Hat]]"") although he does maintain a disliking to Cartman as most others do.

Tweek does not fare well under stress, often experiencing feelings of extreme paranoia whenever he is given a task to complete. This, in addition to his general forgetfulness and lack of focus, has given him the reputation of being highly unreliable. Apart from being easily excitable and prone to panicking, Tweek has also shown signs of exaggerated paranoia, often dreaming up of (mostly unfounded) negative eventualities to simple actions. When under extreme stress, he has also been known to retreat into his imagination (""find [his] center""), often picturing peaceful, grassy fields or tranquil landscapes to calm himself down.

By contrast, he has also been shown to have a strong moral center and a willingness to act upon it. For example, he stood up for his friends in ""[[Free Hat]]"", wielding an RPG and telling [[Steven Spielberg]], ""All I want are my friends!"" Although he is easily manipulated, he usually does not willingly take a role in Cartman's schemes, remaining neutral or passive.

According to his parents, Tweek suffers from [[Attention Deficit Disorder]] (ADD), but it is revealed in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' that his parents lace his coffee (and all the coffee they sell) with Meth, which he drinks like water. Whenever they think he needs to calm down, they just give him more coffee. He twitches similar to [[Rebecca Cotswolds]] or [[Thomas]], which is likely caused by all of the coffee (or meth) he drinks. [[Craig Tucker]], as shown in ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"", can calm him down and stop him twitching - briefly.

[[File:ChildAbductionIsNotFunny01.jpg|thumb|Tweek with his parents.]]
[[Richard Tweak|Richard]] and [[Mrs. Tweak]] own [[Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse|a local coffee shop]]. They supply their son with coffee (mixed with grounded meth), unaware it is the cause of Tweek's physical and mental problems, they instead blame it on his attention deficit disorder.

They are not shown to be the best parents; in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"", Tweek's father tries to communicate through long-winded anecdotes that ""never go anywhere"" while in ""[[Gnomes]]"", he uses flowery similes and metaphors (''""A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon, or a hug from your dear old aunt...""'') that sometimes exasperate his son. Exasperated, Tweek once exclaims ""You guys never help me! Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out!""

In ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", they cause Tweek's nervousness to skyrocket when they turn their home into a virtual prison and conduct random safety drills after stories regarding child abduction surface on the news. It is Tweek's parents' clumsy approach to parenting that almost gets him kidnapped by a child molester (the Ghost of Human Kindness), precipitating the events of the episode.

During ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"", his parents were amongst the majority of the town in support of Tweek and Craig’s spontaneous relationship. While at dinner his father readily shows his support for his son supposedly being a homosexual. They further supported Tweek’s relationship by being hospitable to Craig once he comes to visit Tweek, offering him coffee. However, the episode also implies that they, or at least Richard, are only supportive of Tweek because having a gay son makes them seem more progressive and better parents, as Richard callously tells Tweek that he always assumed he was ""just a spaz"". This is repeated in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', where Richard asks the New Kid to help get Tweek and Craig to make up because having a gay son is good for business.

In ""[[City People]]"", Tweek's grandmother can be seen on the toilet as [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is showing the [[City People (Group)|City People]] around the house. Details of her relationship with him is unknown, but it can be assumed she is either visiting or now lives with Tweek and his parents.

Nothing is known about Tweek's relationship with his co-owned guinea pig, other than the fact that he bought Stripe #4 for his boyfriend, [[Craig Tucker|Craig]].

[[File:Snapshot 1 (6-23-2011 12-31 AM).jpg|thumb|Tweek as part of [[Craig's Gang]].]]
Craig's gang consistently includes [[Craig Tucker|Craig]], [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], while Tweek often plays a role as the fourth member. Depending on the situation, the fourth member is sometimes Jimmy Valmer instead.

Tweek and Craig's first notable interaction was their fight in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"". In the episode, the two were repeatedly goaded into fighting each other for the other boys' entertainment. However, the animosity between them seems to have been resolved, and as they are often seen together, they may be assumed to be friends.
[[File:TweekvsCraig067.png|left|thumb|Craig and Tweek before their fight in ""[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"".]]
Notably, Tweek can be seen with Craig in the majority of his background appearances. In ""[[Ginger Kids]]"", they are trapped in a cage together, and in ""[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]"", they are on the same side of the town. In ""[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]"", Tweek is seen working in the same study group as Craig, in ""[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"", they are playing football together along with [[Tolkien Black|Tolkien]], [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], and [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]], and at the end of ""[[Proper Condom Use]]"", they can be seen standing next to each other. Tweek also hides scared behind Craig in ""[[Marjorine]]"", when they are all spying on the girls' house. In ""[[You're Getting Old]]"", they sit next to each other at [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s birthday table. At the school assemblies, they are often seen sitting next to each other. 

In ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"", the new female Asian students are drawing [[Yaoi]] pictures of Tweek and Craig in love. To stop the drawings, the two stage a fake breakup, but Tweek goes too far and makes Craig out to be a cheater by inventing a ""Michael"" character for dramatic effect. The two later reunite after their breakup crushes the town's spirit, and are seen holding hands and playing video games with each other. In ""[[PC Principal Final Justice]]"", they are seen holding hands still in the school hallway.

In ""[[Wieners Out]]"", they are seen together in the gymnasium watching the girls volleyball game and then proceed to flash their genitals during the national anthem in support of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' movement. In ""[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]"", Kyle commands Tweek and Craig to respond to his offensive posts towards gay people.

Despite originally maintaining a fake relationship for the sake of the town, the two end up staying together by choice even after the town loses interest. Craig refers to Tweek as his boyfriend in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' and openly tells the player that he is gay. It is also revealed that Tweek bought Craig his [[Stripe|fourth guinea pig]].

In the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, ""[[Put It Down]]"", Tweek stresses over nuclear bomb threats made by North Korea. Craig suggests that he make cupcakes for them, and this worked until [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] insisted that Tweek had pooped in the cupcake batter, and continued to make things worse with several other tweets. Craig tries his best to make Tweek feel better by giving him logical answers, which only made things worse. But after hearing [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]'s speech about grieving, he comforts Tweek and talks with him about how he is feeling, helping him truly feel better.

[[File:FreeHat035.png|thumb|Tweek with [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]].]]
In ""[[Gnomes]]"", [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] places Tweek in the boys' group for their homework assignment. The boys initially express their disdain at this, saying ""Dude, we can't work with this kid!"" However, as the episode progresses, they slowly warm to him.

In later episodes, Tweek is shown to consider the main boys as his friends. In the episode ""[[Professor Chaos]]"", he is chosen to take the position of the fourth friend in the sixth season to replace [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]. In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", when the boys decide they have to make room for Bebe in their group, Kyle and Stan defend Tweek and kick Cartman out instead.

He also seems to enjoy hanging out with the boys, however, it is shown that Tweek does not want to be a part of the strange, crazy adventures that the boys regularly embark on, at one point in ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"" remarking, ""That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!""

Tweek is never officially kicked out of the group, as Butters was, but judging from his unexplained absence following ""[[A Ladder to Heaven]]"", it is assumed that he drifted back to his old friends. However, he stays on friendly terms with the main boys too, often being invited to help with their latest schemes.

Cartman has nothing against Tweek (even electing to replace Kyle instead of Tweek initially when they wanted to let Bebe in the group in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]""), but Tweek seems to harbor some dislike for Cartman.

In ""[[Free Hat]]"", Cartman pressured Tweek into making hats and threatened him into shaping up, or else, he would be kicked out of the group. Later on in the episode, when Kyle, Stan, and Cartman are being held hostage by [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]], Tweek comes to save them wielding an RPG, saying, ""All I want are my friends!"" Cartman seems touched by this, until Tweek adds, ""Except for Cartman, you can keep him."" That being said, Tweek is one student that Eric has a genuine friendship with.

Tweek is rarely seen by himself; he is almost always shown with a peer or a group of peers. He also placed in the top ten on the girls' [[The List/Trivia|list of cutest boys]].

In ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", Tweek is invited to the girls' big whore party, along with the rest of the boys, excluding Cartman.

However, his appearances have tapered off in recent seasons, and he is conspicuous by his absence from the rest of the group's slumber party in ""[[The Last of the Meheecans]]"".

Tweek also has a couple of involuntary verbal tics, like ""''nngh''!"" and ""''gah''!"", which interpose his dialogue.

Tweek serves as an unlockable character in the racing game South Park Rally. To unlock him, the player must enter championship mode with any character and collect five caffeine turbos (blue speed lines on the blue item box) during the spring cleaning race.

Tweek plays a small role in the storyline of ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and appears at the end of the ""Great Wall of South Park"" level to inform the player the villain is hiding at the Docks, panicking that he was explicitly told not to tell him. The boys show a lack of trust in him and run off to fight without him. He is in the same ""Medic""-type class as [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Timmy Burch]], and [[Bebe Stevens]], moving quickly but dealing minimal damage. His special ability causes [[Make Love, Not Warcraft|light himself on fire]] and as long as he is on fire, any enemy he touches is dealt with heavy damage or dies.

Tweek plays a moderate role in this game, taking on the persona [[Wonder Tweek]]. ''Therapy Wars'' is the most prominent quest Tweek is part of. This specific quest is unlocked after the New Kid completes ''Ghost Reconciler'' and ends with a battle against the [[Therapy Kids]] with [[Mr. Mackey]]. During this battle, a team ultimate will become unlocked for both [[Super Craig]] and Tweek. When the fight is over, the New Kid will receive the Triumph of the Heart artifact and Tweek and Craig's character sheets.

As well as giving two quests to the New Kid, Tweek is a playable character with abilities that can heal, chill, shock, and deal moderate to low damage. 

''Hot Coffee'' is part of the main quest where [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] asks the player to recruit Tweek. He can be found in the [[Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse]] behind the door marked ''Employees Only''. He sends [[Douchebag]] on a mission to get the ""Special Delivery"" from [[Kenny McCormick]]'s house since he would not be allowed to play with the boys until he finishes his chores. Once Douchebag obtains the delivery from the meth-making tweakers in Kenny's garage, he returns to Tweek's house, where Tweek friends him on Facebook and [[Richard Tweak|his father]] allows him to go play.

He also assists in aiding the raid on the Inn of the Giggling Donkey, coming in after Cartman tells the player to go and rescue [[Princess Kenny]]. While not playing an actual role here, he goes along with the others to aid Cartman while the player heads upstairs.

He is seen again at the [[South Park Elementary|school]] if the player decides to side with Cartman rather than [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. Here, he is assisting in the fight against the elves alongside the player. He sends the player a message asking if everyone was dead and is not seen again after this.

If you talk to him after the end of the game, he will say that he is glad yesterday is over, while worrying that today might be worse. He will also say that he cannot talk because he needs to practice.

Although Tweek has fewer speaking roles than other background characters such as [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] or [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], he generally plays a larger role in the episodes in which he does appear.

In the [[Season Six]] episodes ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", ""[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]"", ""[[Free Hat]]"", ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", and ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", he replaces [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] (who in turn replaced [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]) as the fourth friend.

Following ""[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]"", Tweek stopped appearing as part of the main group, due primarily to Kenny's re-introduction, first as a spirit sharing [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s body, and later when he was brought back permanently in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"". He has made several background appearances but does not have another major role until the episode ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"", in [[Season Nineteen]].

Two Astronauts,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Two_Astronauts,,"are two unnamed men who appeared in the [[Season Six]] episode ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"".

When a United States space shuttle crash lands back on Earth in front of [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]'s house, two astronauts emerge from the wreckage. They ask the boys to call 911 for them. However, when the boys start making monkey-like sounds again, the astronauts mistakenly believe that they landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and that apes have taken over. In response, they both commit suicide by shooting themselves in the head so they do not have to live in the ""futuristic madness"".

Both astronauts wear large white space suits with red trims and what looks like a parody of the NASA logo. The first astronaut has short brown hair, brown eyebrows, and some facial stubble. The second astronaut has flat black hair, black eyebrows, and a slight cleft chin.

Two Farmers,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Two_Farmers,,"are two rednecks who often complain about new trends, in addition to their careers as janitors, ranchers and more.

They made their first appearance in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, ""[[You're Getting Old]]"" as part of the audience watching [[Randy Marsh|Steamy Ray Vaughn]] perform at [[Mick's Bowling]]. They think they should steal Randy's panties so they don't suffer the fate of being violently farted by his [[Tween Wave|tween wave]] performance.

In ""[[The Magic Bush]]"" and ""[[Sponsored Content]]"", one of them was interviewed by the news. He also had a conversation with Skeeter and Randy on ""[[Truth and Advertising]]"".

The two ranchers made an appearance in ""[[Stunning and Brave]]"", commenting on the PC Triangle members as they had a party.

In ""[[The City Part of Town]]"", they show the [[Whole Foods Representative]] how they slaughter cattle.

One of them plays an important role in the ""[[Let Them Eat Goo]]"". He drove the cattle to Randy's farm on orders from [[Goo Man]], and recorded the scene of Randy and [[Towelie (Character)|Towelie]] killing the cows, which led to the closure of [[Tegridy Burger]].

One of them has short dark gray hair with long side locks and wears a white shirt underneath a red rolled-up sleeved jacket and gray pants with brown boots. The other has a gray beard and wears a green shirt and brown pants. Both have several facial wrinkles.

Tyler Perry,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tyler_Perry,,"is an American actor, director, producer and screenwriter who appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode ""[[Funnybot]]"".

In ""[[Funnybot]]"", he was the only person who was present to collect his comedy award, other than [[Jimmy Valmer]]. He received the Kathy Griffin Award, which is awarded to the person who is most likely to show up to collect it.

Throughout the episode, Perry communicates almost exclusively through catchphrases from his movies, such as ""Oh Lerrrrd!"" and ""Halleluyer!"", dressed as his character Mabel ""Madea"" Simmons. The episode portrays his comedy as appealing solely to black people - [[Tolkien Black]] is the only one who laughs at his jokes, giving him money every time he speaks. [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] also mentions watching one of Perry's movies with his family before the end of the world. Both of them are embarrassed to admit that they find Perry's comedy funny.

Tyler's antics become increasingly absurd, reaching the point that he dressed up as his most famous character, Mabel Simmons, and refused to leave [[South Park Elementary]]. At the end, the Americans and Germans secured him within an enormous metal sphere deep underground, in place of [[Funnybot (Character)|Funnybot]], stating that he was ""one of the worst threats to the world.""

Perry initially appears as a relatively faithful portrayal of his real-life self, dressed in a suit and tie.

However, later in the episode, he appears as his character Madea, wearing a purple dress, a gaudy pearl necklace, a pair of thick-rimmed pink glasses, and a grey curly wig, with inexpertly applied red lipstick.

He appears to be extremely desperate for attention and money, showing up to receive an award from South Park Elementary despite the sheer frivolity of it, and annoying everyone with his overbearing and melodramatic antics as his character Madea. He also only appeared to stay in South Park since Tolkien paid him every time he told jokes. 

",['Barack Obama']
Ugly Bob,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Ugly_Bob,,"is a [[Canada|Canadian]] who makes his debut appearance in the [[Season Two]] episode, ""[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]"". Being hideously ugly, he wears a paper bag to hide his face at all times.

Ugly Bob reappears well over a decade later in ""[[Royal Pudding]]"" which reveals that at some point, he moved to the USA. In America, Bob is not considered ugly. He is just considered Canadian.

It seems that only Canadians can see how hideous Bob truly is. He still wears a paper bag over his head at all times though, and now also sports a brown jacket. He runs into [[Ike Broflovski]] on their way to the Canadian call to arms, admitting he had no idea there were other Canadians living in America. They join with the other Canadians to confront [[Scott the Dick]] who is now a giant, but soon realize he could not have kidnapped the [[Prince and Princess of Canada|Princess]]. He and Ike join Scott after the real culprits, suspecting a group of [[Inuit|Eskimos]], but they quickly discover Scott is incorrect. Luckily, the Eskimos lead them to the true culprit - [[Tooth Decay]]. 

Ugly Bob seems to become even more ugly over time, as he is instrumental in the defeat of Tooth Decay. His horrific (Canadian) visage is now so ugly that Ike exposing it to the monster turns it to stone. He is then given a Canadian Medal of Honor by the Princess.

Ugly Bob's face has been described as looking like ""somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver"". He wears green pants and an orange, long-sleeved shirt. His shirt, like [[Terrance and Phillip]]'s and [[Scott the Dick]]'s shirts, has his name's first initial embroidered on it, however, his is in lowercase. When they meet, Terrance and Phillip advise him to wear a brown paper bag over his head, and he takes this good advice to heart. 

In ""[[Royal Pudding]]"" he is seen wearing a brown jacket and a brown-grey colored paper bag.

In ""[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]"", Ugly Bob takes Terrance and Phillip's advice of wearing the paper bag over his head. [[Celine Dion]], who, in the show, had been married to but divorced Terrance, fell for him and they had sex with each other. She does not yet know about his true appearance, because he wore the bag over his head at all times to help hide the fact that he is actually hideously ugly, and refers to him as ""Handsome Bob"".

Terrance, meanwhile, had rescued the [[Sally Dion|daughter]] he had had with Celine during their marriage, and he wants to start a life with her again. When he finds out about her new relationship, he pulls the bag off of Bob's head, revealing his true appearance to her. She screams in horror, but decides to stay with Bob nonetheless, on the condition that he keeps the bag over his head at all times. Later, it is discovered that he had impregnated Celine, and they both hope that the baby would turn out to look like Celine.

Ugly Bob is friends with Terrance and Phillip enough that they will talk to him despite his horrific deformity, which apparently only Canadians can see. Terrance and Phillip mockingly suggest that Ugly Bob start wearing a paper bag on his head to keep people from knowing how ugly he is, and repeatedly insult his appearance. To the viewer, Bob looks just like Terrance and Phillp, but Bob seems to agree with them on his ugliness and soon after starts wearing the bag.

Meets Ike on a bus. He had not previously known that there are other Canadians living in the U.S. He and Ike join up to help find the princess.

In order to persuade men to join, the reel touts a USO show with [[Big Gay Al]] and [[Winona Ryder]]. The only way to see the show, is to join the Army. A traditional image of Uncle Sam is shown.

Uncle Stinky,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Uncle_Stinky,,"In his first appearance in ""[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]"", he and the rest of Cartman's extended family will spend the holidays at his [[Mabel Cartman|mother]]'s house. He is first seen greeting [[The Boys|the boys]] as Liane introduces the family members to them. The next day, Cartman asks him if he can take them to the mall to see [[Mr. Hankey]], but he angrily denies it since he didn't want to lose to the football game on TV. He and the rest of the Cartmans are later held hostage by Howard and [[Charles Manson]] before they surrender. At the end of the episode, he and the rest of the family surprise Charles Manson in prison by singing him a Merry Christmas song. The official script shows that he would have more speaking roles, including one greeting Howard, which were eventually cut from the episode.

He makes a small background appearance on the cover of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.

In ""[[Cartmanland]]"", he attends the funeral of his mother, who ended up leaving her home in Nebraska as his property. During the reading of the will, he is amazed to find that he has lost the one million dollars of his mother's inheritance to Cartman.

In ""[[Royal Pudding]]"", Eric says that his uncle is second in line to be manager of Gart Brothers, possibly referring to him.

Stinky has brown curly hair, a mustache and a goatee. He wears a green turtle neck sweater and gray pants. Like most of his relatives, he is overweight and has a double chin.

Underpants Gnomes,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Underpants_Gnomes,,"The first person to bear witness to the existence of the Underpants Gnomes was [[Tweek Tweak]], who always managed to remain awake for their visits due to his heavy coffee addiction. Whenever he attempted to tell others of their existence, people assumed he was hallucinating and overly stimulated. However, when [[The Boys|the boys]] were forced to do a school project with Tweek, they soon realize that the Gnomes are indeed real, and are indeed stealing underpants. The reason for the thefts is apparently due to some sort of higher corporate plan. The plan was outlined thus:

:'''''Phase 1: '''Steal Underpants.''
:'''''Phase 2: '''?''
:'''''Phase 3: '''Profit''

Despite the Gnomes' plan being somewhat lacking in certain areas, they are apparently very intelligent in regards to economics and business, teaching the boys about big corporations.

The Underpants Gnomes appear again in ""[[Red Sleigh Down]]"", in which it is revealed that [[Santa Claus]] does not hire elves, but rather the Underpants Gnomes to be his holiday helpers. Although they spend most of the year collecting underpants, every Christmas season they travel to the North Pole, where they work as central control for Santa's holiday mission. One year, Santa was shot down over Iraq, and the Underpants Gnomes helped the boys locate [[Jesus Christ]] to help in an exfiltration mission.

[[File:38a.jpg|thumb|Gnomes on [[South Park Studios]].]]
Underpants Gnomes appear in the stereotypical Gnome fashion, with thick long beards. They primarily wear red shirts, blue pants, and black belts. Each wears a tall pointed hat, normally green or black in color. Many carry backpacks in order to store the underwear.

Gnomes are apparently very sturdy creatures, who can stand-up easily to physical abuse; Cartman striking one with a stick did not appear to harm it, merely prompting it to call him a pussy. Though it should be noted that Cartman is fairly nonathletic and might not be capable of hitting very hard.


They appear as an enemy. They have low health but make up for it with speed and numbers.

They once again appear as enemies, using work-related magic. An [[Gnome Warlock]] also appears as a boss, specializing in underpants magic to inflict damage. They also give the New Kid the ability to shrink down to their size.

When [[Pete]] and [[Firkle]] go to the vampire reunion to tell the [[South Park Vampire Society|vamp kids]] about the camp that is turning kids into emos, the black vampire stands up and asks if anyone at the meeting could be an emo posing as a vampire, Pete surprised by him, says yes, the black vampire then gets out of his seat to tell the possible traitor to prepare to run and quickly accuses [[Vladimir]] of being the traitor.

The black vampire then asks if she can enter her room to fight her and the other emos that were in the room. Pete responds by saying that he cannot just come into the room and fight the emos and they needed to stop it at their source, so Mike suggests they call [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to help them.

The black vamp is later seen with Pete, Firkle, and the vampire children trying to summon Edgar. After Edgar shows up, when Pete tells him about the camp that makes kids into emos, Edgar scoffs at the Vamp Kids saying he can't be seen with stupid vampire boys wearing plastic fangs, Pete thanks him for saying it is good to know Edgar Allan Poe agrees with the gothic, Edgar then scoffs at Pete saying that a blood demon shit on his head, making the black vampire mock Pete.

Later, he along with Pete, Edgar, and the others, go to the camp with the plan to rescue Michael and set fire to the place. The black vamp then says that he would go crazy if he finds out that someone in the car Pete was driving is an undercover emo who will reveal himself when they get into the place.

When they enter, Firkle reveals that he was an emo all the time. The black vamp and the others are then held in chairs by a gardener named [[Howard Flannigan]], with plants that, according to the gardener, turn children into emos.

Veronica has two specific forms. Her human form is that of a moderately attractive black-haired woman, who is slightly taller and thinner than Chef. She haves long black hair, arched eyebrows, and pink lipstick. She is often seen wearing a thin dark-green dress held at the waist and black shoes. She is later depicted in a short, frilly wedding dress, a white flower crown with a veil, a light-blue lace, white shoes, and holds a colorful bouquet.

Veronica's true demon form however is that of a demented, massive beast of a woman; with low-hanging breasts, cloven-hoofed feet, blood-red eyes, protruding fangs, and large red leathery wings. She does not appear to wear any clothing in this form, however, she has an exaggeratedly large tuft of pubic hair which acts as a loincloth.

Chef first met Veronica while searching for Kama Sutra books at the library. Using her hypnotic song, ""[[The Morning After]]"", she tricked Chef into spending the night, talking to him about ""the goddess"" and the evils of men, and forcing him to fall in love with her. [[Mr. Derp]] tells [[The Boys|The boys]] that Chef quitted being the school chef and became an accountant to get a change about meaningless sex. The boys, however, grew suspicious of Veronica's behavior, primarily out of jealousy of losing Chef to her and to get married. However, after talking to [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], the boys realized that she was in truth a demonic Succubus, a demon sent from Hell to suck the life out of men. The boys soon discovered that Garrison was right, though Garrison was not speaking in the literal sense when she revealed her demonic form. The boys attempted to warn Chef, who did not believe them, and cast them out.

After doing research, the boys soon discovered that to defeat Veronica, they would need to force her to listen to her own song backward. They did so at her wedding, causing her to reveal her true form to not only Chef but to his parents and the rest of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. After she managed to kill [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] sang the rest of the song to cast Veronica to the pits of Hell from whence she came and to never come back.

Veronica Crabtree,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Veronica_Crabtree,,"was [[South Park Elementary]]'s main bus driver. She was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] during the first three seasons and by [[Eliza J. Schneider]] until Crabtree's death in [[Season Eight]].

While she has never performed the voice in the series, [[April Stewart]] has stated on Twitter that she performed the voice in her audition before [[Season Eight]] and is still capable of doing so.

In ""[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]"", it is implied at the end of the episode that she had sexual intercourse with [[Liane Cartman]], which made her a potential mother of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], but as a result of ""[[201]]"", it is revealed that Liane was Eric's mother.

Crabtree was, for the most part, a background character, used only for the occasional joke or for scenes on the [[School Bus]]. However, she received a prominent role in ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"", when upon driving the kids back from school, she takes the bus off the main road and ends up getting it stuck on the edge of a cliff. Crabtree immediately goes to get help for the kids and orders them to stay on the bus in her absence, by threatening to kill a bunny with a gun. While the students have assorted flashbacks relating to past adventures, she makes it to the main road and is picked up by a trucker named [[Marcus]], with his truck delivering Roofies. She takes several, believing them to be aspirin. However, the drugs only seem to calm her slightly from her normal insanity. She begins a relationship with Marcus, thus forgetting about the kids, and begins life as a stand-up comedian on ''[[Jay Leno|The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. However, she finds the life empty and goes off with Marcus to watch the sunset. In the end, the episode everything, even Crabtree's own story is implied to be a dream of one of [[the boys]], which she and Marcus acknowledge sadly.

She was the object of a few sexual jokes one of which had [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]] 'paper bagging' her ugly face so he could succeed at having sex with her in ""[[Chef Aid]]"". Another joke was about her impossibly wide vagina in the episode ""[[Fat Camp]]"", where Kenny was supposed to crawl into her uterus and stay there for six straight hours before coming out. She was excited about being on TV, adding that she had not had this much attention paid to her cooch since she was 16. Later, when [[Cartman Impostor|Kenny's lookalike]], came out of her uterus dead, she sarcastically said: ""I told you I was a tight virgin flower."" after having passed a 35th trimester boy.

Her final surviving appearance was in ""[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]"", driving the bus and surprising [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], styled as Otto Man from [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]. She only screamed a few times, then drives off.

[[File:Snapshot20110304184025.png|thumb|right|Ms. Crabtree's death in ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]""]]
Ms. Crabtree was murdered, as well as the bird nesting on her head, by [[Michael Deets]] in ""[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]"". Michael had killed her by several stabbings and having her left hand and the bird's left wing cut off. Officer [[Mitch Murphy]] commented ""She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much."" [[Harrison Yates]] also yelled, ""She may not have been in any recent episodes, but dammit she deserved better than this!"", poking fun at her lack of recent appearances at the time. This also marked one of ''South Park's'' few moments of breaking the fourth wall, which is very rare. Her position as the school bus driver was then evidently taken over by [[Jose Venezuela]], as shown in ""[[Ginger Kids]]"".

She wore a blue sweater and green trousers. She had crooked yellow teeth, baggy eyes, wrinkles, an angry expression (most of the time), and messy, scraggly dark brown hair. The bird living on her head has three small wings on its orange head, a green belly, and blue wings. (In ""[[Fat Camp]]"", it is revealed that she has brown socks). She also appeared to be overweight.

Ms. Crabtree appeared to be mentally unstable and had anger issues. She was usually cranky and she constantly screamed at the children on her bus and always angrily demanded, ""What did you say?!"" after they insult her. Occasionally, she screamed blindly at the students to intimidate them. In later episodes, she appeared to be slightly calmer and rational. It may be possible that the reason why she so angry, uptight and aggressive was from watching bus driver training videos, as shown in ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"".

Visitors are typical looking aliens (like Roswell) with gray skin. They are tall and skinny with tear drop shaped heads. They have tall skinny eyes and no noses. They do not wear clothing and do not have any addition distinguishing features. 
In the show, there is a long-running gag of Visitors appearing, either as prominent characters or hidden in many episodes of the show.  Some of these episodes include:

In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', the Visitors are the main type of enemies during the first night of the game. 

Though not prominent in gameplay, an alien does appear in some of the [[The New Kid]]'s ""backstories"" (depending on the powers the player chose), presented by Cartman. In one of the stories, the alien appears as a brief fighting ally.

On the first night, [[the New Kid]] gets abducted by visitors and receives an anal probe. In order to escape, the New Kid is required to solve puzzles on board the visitor's ship, and defeat several visitors such as the [[Alien Pilots]].

After arriving back the boys journey through the store to find the 'heart', Wall-Mart tries to defend itself by lowering all its prices by a ridiculously low amount. The boys find a man inside the store claiming to be Wall-Mart who shows them a mirror. Wall-Mart described the consumer is the heart of Wall-Mart to which the boys respond by smashing the mirror causing the store to cave in.

In its human form, it appears as an old man, wearing a white suit and black tie.

Wall-Mart has a lust for power, putting other companies out of business while feeling no remorse.

It is also violent, having no qualms about killing those who vocalize their disapproval of it.

The three disliked Wall-Mart, due to it causing all the other businesses in South Park to go bankrupt, because of this, they and Wall-Mart were enemies throughout ""[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]"".

Cartman loved Wall-Mart, so it took advantage of this love and manipulated him into betraying the rest of the boys, they had a pseudo-friendship, mostly due to Cartman's naivety and selfishness.

During a brief period in which Towelie managed to get clean of drugs, he entered in a loving relationship with a woman named Rebecca. 

Although they never married, soon after their relationship started, Rebecca (through unknown means) became pregnant and soon gave birth to Washcloth. Unlike Towelie, Washcloth does not appear to be as physically developed (he has no eyes, mouth, arms, or legs), but he apparently is able to convey his feelings.

Unfortunately, soon after his birth, Towelie's past addiction to weed gave birth to other addictions including cocaine and meth. His addiction soon became so bad that Rebecca had no choice but to throw out Towelie, feeling that he would be a bad influence on their son.

Towelie would often call Rebecca while high, demanding that he be allowed to talk to Washcloth, each time with Rebecca refusing. When [[The Boys|the boys]] also reached their limits in regards to dealing with Towelie's drug problem, they set up an intervention for him. [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] managed to apparently convince Rebecca to allow him to take Washcloth (who was upset by Towelie getting high and abusive) to the intervention. Upon seeing his son for the first time in months, Towelie then promised that he would never leave or upset his son again and agreed to go into rehab. Towelie has since then gotten clean and moved back in with Rebecca and Washcloth.

The Washington Redskins are owned by [[Dan Snyder]].

In ""[[Go Fund Yourself]]"", Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder confronts Cartman, who has created a start-up company under the name ""Washington Redskins"", and asks him to stop using the name for his company, claiming that Cartman's use of the name is offensive to his football team and distorts its image. Cartman refuses, claiming that since the trademark for the Washington Redskins got pulled after a court ruling he can use it. Unable to legally make Cartman change the name, Dan Snyder goes to [[Roger Goodell]] and demands that he do something. Goodell, who is a robot, malfunctions and is unable to give an actual, substantial reply, delivering only empty platitudes. Snyder calls all the other NFL team owners on Skype to sort out a solution to his problem, and they agree to pressure Cartman into changing his company logo, which is the same as the logo of the football team.

Under this pressure, Cartman does change the logo. However, the new logo still maintains the original Redskins logo, just with an added pair of tits and male genitalia drawn onto the logo. In response, Snyder gathers his team and attacks Kickstarter headquarters, in the style of an American Indian attack, destroying their servers and thus destroying Cartman's company. However, Cartman, alongside [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]], reforms his company, changing the logo once more, now with two of the Redskins logos, with titties and balls and penises and one taking the other from behind.

Distressed about the joke that their team has become, all the Redskins team members quit before a game with the Dallas Cowboys. Unwilling to surrender, Dan Snyder goes out and faces the Cowboys, himself. Snyder gets brutalized by the Cowboys, repeatedly, and eventually, the crowd, disgusted by the display, turns to support Snyder and the Redskins. The outraged crowd proceeds to boycott Cartman's Redskins, saying the name shouldn't be used in an offensive manner, following the ""massacre"" of Dan Snyder in his last stand with the Cowboys, and Cartman is forced to abandon his company.

*'''Sedition:''' In the [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|movie]], she was a member of [[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]], a group with the goal of stopping the execution of [[Terrance and Phillip]] by the government. However, she did it to save the world from being ruled by [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Satan]], so it can be justified.
*'''Sexual Harassment (Alleged):''' In ""[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]"", she was sued by [[Craig Tucker]] for touching his thigh, and was forced to give him half of her belongings when the court ruled in his favor. However, given that this was one of a series of dubious sexual harassment suits around South Park, this charge is questionable at best.

Her name is said to be based on ""Wendy Westaburger"", the wife of one of [[Matt Stone]]'s friends.Wendy has committed the following crimes throughout the series:
In ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", Wendy is shown to be fluent in Arabic, using the language to talk to the agents she hired to launch [[Ms. Ellen]] into the sun.

In ""[[Chinpokomon]]"", Wendy becomes so engrossed in the new ''[[Chinpokomon (Brand)|Chinpokomon]]'' fad that she was able to confidently speak a [[Japan]]ese phrase.

In ""[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]"", she became a member of [[Eric Cartman]]'s ""boy band"" [[Fingerbang]], after wowing [[The Boys|the boys]] with a [[Wendy's Audition Song|song]] similar to the popular euphemistic ""Miss Susie"" rhyme.

Wendy also took part in the Thanksgiving musical play in ""[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]"".

In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", she performed the opening song as well as several other duets with [[Bridon Gueermo]].

In ''[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics (Album)|Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]'', Wendy performs a duet with [[Stan Marsh]] entitled ""[[It Happened in Sun Valley]]"".

''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' shows her with the rest of the third graders at [[Stark's Pond]], ice skating.[[File:Wendy_1.png|thumb|Ice skating at [[Stark's Pond]].]] During [[Wendy's Song|the song Stan has dedicated to her]], she is given a brief scene that displays a talent for skating, being able to perform a figure-eight, salchow, triple lutz, and twirl endlessly while keeping balance. None of the other children in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] have displayed this kind of ability, meaning that she might be the best ice skater in [[The Boys|the boys]]' class.

Wendy has shown herself to be a fairly decent fighter, beating up [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] after he repeatedly made jokes about Breast Cancer in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"". Although Cartman does manage to get a few hits in, Wendy turns the tide of the fight after ramming Cartman's face into a metal pole, multiple times, leaving Cartman lying in a pool of his own blood. The significance of this is debatable as Cartman has been shown to lose the majority of fights he gets in.

Wendy is portrayed as very political. She has started and joined many campaigns, groups, and debates over the course of the show. She has also participated in stopping conspiracies and assassinations.

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Wendy tries to save [[Terrance and Phillip]] from [[Mothers Against Canada|M.A.C.]] along with [[Gregory]], implores Stan to be more political, attempts to rally students to her cause, and later joins [[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]].

In ""[[Weight Gain 4000]]"", Wendy is infuriated when Cartman's report wins the school contest, instead of her report on protecting bottle-nosed dolphins. After reading his essay, she reveals to the public at Cartman's presentation with [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] that Cartman had copied ''Walden'' and replaced Henry David Thoreau's name with his own. Because Kathie Lee Gifford had already left at that point, nobody cared, further annoying her. In the meantime, Wendy and Stan tried to stop [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] and [[Mr. Hat]] from assassinating Kathie, although Mr. Hat ends up shooting at her, killing [[Kenny McCormick]] by mistake.

In ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", she was one of a few people who realize why [[Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy|Chef]] is upset about the [[South Park Flag]], and immediately volunteers to represent the ""Flag Should be Changed"" team for the upcoming debate, however, she was mortified to find out that her leading partner was Cartman. She attempts to lead the team without him and decides not to participate in discrediting [[Kyle Broflovski]] and Stan's team, who believed the flag should stay the way it was. They eventually begin to work together, and their partnership improves as they found that they had more and more things in common with each other, which leads to Wendy having a temporary crush on him. At the presentation, this attraction made it difficult for her to voice her side of the debate, causing her to kiss him.From 1997 to 1999, Wendy Testaburger was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]]. Bergman listed Wendy among her five favorite roles in ''[[South Park]]'', (together with [[Liane Cartman]], [[Shelly Marsh]], [[Carol McCormick]], and [[Sheila Broflovski]]); stating that she admired the character's overall sweetness and intelligence, balanced by her unpredictability.In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', she is married to [[Darwin]], having returned to South Park to attend Kenny's funeral, and later assists in investigating the cause of Kenny's death.

Her martial status does not carry over in an alternate timeline seen at the end of ''[[South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid]]'', with her asking Stan if they could spend the New Year holidays together. It is also revealed that she is employed by Harvard University.

Wendy wears a pinkish-magenta beret, a light purple jacket with a navy blue trim, navy blue gloves, and yellow trousers. She also has peach skin like many of the characters, long black hair with choppy, uneven bangs. Under her jacket, she has been shown to be wearing a light purple tank-top in ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", and a white tank top with a unicorn on it in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"". Wendy has only been seen without her beret in two episodes, ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", where she took off her beret to dunk her head in her fishbowl, and ""[[Funnybot]]"", where she was seen dressed up without her beret.

As her transgender alter-ego ""Wendyl"" in ""[[The Cissy]]"", she kept her beret, but pinned back her hair and also wore a white t-shirt, denim vest, and light purple pants.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', she wears a navy blue jacket over purple collared shirt and a navy blue skirt. She also wears a pair of glasses, gold earrings, and gold bead necklace. She does not wear her beret.

[[File:Insheeption03.jpg|right|thumb|Wendy and Stan.]]
Wendy is best described as a mature and intelligent person whose stubbornness and occasional jealousy sometimes get the best of her; she is typically portrayed as nice, feminine, smart, and liberal in nature. In many episodes, she generally provides a voice of reason, usually against [[Eric Cartman]], especially in earlier seasons. She is generally friendly to others and seems well-liked at school, but she is unwilling to let her beliefs be compromised by popularity. Wendy is shown to be very intelligent and politically aware, writing an [[Weight Gain 4000|essay on the suffering of Bottlenose dolphins]], [[Pinkeye|donating candy to starving children in Nairobi]], being willing to [[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants|give Afghanistan children a dollar]], opposing [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|the American-Canadian War]], and doing a report on the [[Breast Cancer Show Ever|suffering of Breast Cancer patients]]. However, as the series, in general, became more political, Wendy's role as the politically aware voice of reason shrank, and by [[Season Five]] she was seldom seen as more than one of the [[List of Female 4th Graders|female students]]. In addition, [[Kyle Broflovski]] took over her duties as the most intelligent student in class and moral center.

[[File:Rsz 1209breastcancershowever--1.png|thumb|left|180px|An enraged Wendy, in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"".]]
Wendy is a very empathic person and often concerned about those around her - she is the first of the girls at [[Heidi Turner]]'s slumber party to feel bad for making fun of [[Butters Stotch|Marjorine]] and she is the first and only student in the whole school to go after [[Tweek Tweak]] after he publicly stages a fake breakup with his [[Craig Tucker|boyfriend]] in ""[[Tweek x Craig]]"". In addition, much of her political activities revolve around concern for others, such as children in Nairobi and Afghanistan, and Bottlenose Dolphins. Wendy also illustrates an adherence to rules and order - she refuses to step out of line against Cartman until given informal permission to attack him and exposed Cartman for cheating at the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest. In ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", she was shown to have a strong motherly instinct; after hearing from [[Bebe Stevens]] about the way Stan had treated their egg, she was deeply worried that Stan would damage the egg which had belonged to Kyle and herself before [[Herbert Garrison|Ms. Garrison]] switched their partners. She even went over to Kyle's house, frantically asking to see the egg and hold it for a couple of minutes. After seeing how well Stan and Kyle took care of the egg and presented it to the Governor of Colorado at the end of the episode, she saw how good Stan's fathering skills were, and relaxed. Despite this, she has shown carelessness as well - in ""[[Pinkeye]]"", after initially planning a couples' dress as Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy she ""realized how stupid [they] would look"", and dressed as Chewbacca instead, not thinking about how it would affect Stan.

[[File:Wendytr.png|180px|right|thumb|Wendy's eyes at the end of ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"".]]
Wendy will generally be kind to characters besides [[Eric Cartman]], but is prone to becoming antagonistic if she feels she has been wronged. Wendy almost always, however, attempts to resolve things peacefully before resorting to [[Breast Cancer Show Ever|violence]] or [[Dances with Smurfs|manipulation]]. When Cartman repeatedly berated her attempts to raise awareness for breast cancer, she initially tried to ignore him, before threatening to beat him up. Although Cartman initially agreed, he then tried to get out of it - they ended up having a brutal fight in front of the school. She also becomes somewhat jealous if she feels her relationship with Stan is in danger, but her exact reaction varies based on the situation. Besides her [[Tom's Rhinoplasty|famous encounter]] with [[Ms. Ellen]], wherein she hired [[Iraq]]is to arrest her and shoot her into the sun so she can win Stan back, Wendy displayed jealousy when the boys obsessed over [[Bebe]]'s breasts and gossips about her with the other girls. She was also jealous of Stan's female Facebook friends in ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"". However, in other episodes, both during their relationship and during its hiatus, such as ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"" she seems to have no problem with other girls flirting with Stan.

Wendy is very active in the school's extracurricular activities: aside from being class president, she is seen in ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"" as one of three new members of the cheer squad (the others being [[Nichole]] and [[Jenny Simons|Jenny]]); she became its captain in ""[[The Hobbit]]"". In ""[[Cock Magic]]"", Wendy is shown as the captain of the girl's volleyball team.

[[File:WendyandStankissing.jpg|170px|right|thumb|Wendy and Stan, kissing in ""[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]"".]]
For the first seven seasons of the series, Wendy's most notable feature was her relationship with [[Stan Marsh]]. Their relationship began in the pilot episode ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"", where it was revealed that the two of them had been attracted for some time prior to the series. A recurring gag in the series involved Stan getting queasy from excitement whenever Wendy tried to kiss him (and in early episodes whenever she spoke to him) and then throwing up on her.

[[File:111 wendy msellen.gif|180px|left|thumb|Wendy, warning [[Ms. Ellen]] to stay away from Stan in ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"".]]
Despite Stan's continual vomiting, Wendy has so far stayed with him. She became extremely jealous when Ms. Ellen ""came between them"" in ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"". After Stan falls for [[Ms. Ellen]] and ignores Wendy's attempts to win back his love, Wendy pays a group of Iraqis a large sum of money to capture Ms. Ellen and shoot her into the sun. In the episode, ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Wendy openly insults [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] after Stan (together with the [[List of Male 4th Graders|other boys]]) grows attracted to her developing breasts; this jealousy later extends to the point of her undergoing breast augmentation surgery to turn Stan's attention back to herself.

[[File:Stan Vomits For Someone Else 0001.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Stan and Wendy sitting on a tree branch looking at the sunset; this was shown during a montage looking back at Wendy's relationship with Stan in ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"".]]
Though they remained together until [[Season Seven]], their relationship did not seem as strong, and at times seemed strained (an example being the aforementioned ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]""). On Stan's part, though, it may have largely been because his adventures throughout the seasons left him too busy to pay attention to Wendy. She broke up with him in the [[Season Seven]] episode, ""[[Raisins]]"", although the only reason given was that she wanted to date [[Tolkien Black]].

Even after she had broken up with Stan, he still showed feelings for her and tried to win her back by playing Peter Gabriel's ""[[Shock the Monkey]]"" on his boombox on her lawn, though the plan failed when he saw that Tolkien was in Wendy's room. In ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"", while working on the egg project, he tried to impress Wendy with his fathering abilities and grew jealous of [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] for working as the ""father"" of the same egg Wendy was the ""mother"" of. Near the end of the episode, Wendy complimented Stan on his ""fathering"" abilities, although due to Stan's bitterness, he rejected the complimenting, telling her that he ""didn't care what [she] thinks"".

[[File:Wendy_4.png|thumb|right|Wendy and Stan holding hands in ""[[Super Fun Time]]"".]]
In ""[[The List]]"", Wendy helps Stan to discover that the girls' election of who the cutest and the ugliest boys in [[South Park Elementary]] was rigged. At the end of the episode, she admits to Stan that she enjoyed hanging out with him again, and they attempt to kiss, during which Stan throws up on her again. This is often seen as the ""re-ignition"" of their relationship.

This ""re-ignition"" was verified in the episode ""[[Super Fun Time]]""; Stan pairs with Wendy on the field trip, telling the others that he is with his girlfriend, as well as fretting about the possibility of looking like a dork in front of her.

[[File:Wendy_2.png|thumb|right|Wendy kissing Stan in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"".]] 
In ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"", Wendy gave Stan a small kiss at her locker before walking away; this is notable as it was the first time Stan did not vomit thereafter. This may have been done because [[Trey Parker|Parker]] and [[Matt Stone|Stone]] were getting bored of the near-constant gag, similar to how they grew tired of [[Kenny's Deaths|killing Kenny]] after [[Season Five]].

In ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", when [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] attempted to recruit her into his ""kissing company"", Stan defended her heavily against Butters' advances.

In ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"", Stan heavily defends Wendy when she is being panned by Cartman.

Despite a rather stable relationship in later seasons, Stan has managed to irritate Wendy on occasion. 

[[File:GlutenFreeEbola-00082.png|thumb|Wendy, with Stan, in ""[[Gluten Free Ebola]]"".]]
In ""[[You Have 0 Friends]]"", Wendy tells Stan to change his profile information on his newly created Facebook page to ""in a relationship"", as she was quite upset over it being listed as ""Single"". Later in the episode, she jealously mistook Stan's grandmother's friend, Susan, as a girl who was flirting with Stan by commenting that he looked cute in an unseen photo of a young Stan in a rabbit outfit.

In ""[[Bass to Mouth]]"", Wendy was infuriated and embarrassed when she learned that [[Eavesdropper]] had revealed a private e-mail Stan sent to [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], in which he called another girl's butt crack ""hot"". In ""[[The Hobbit]]"", Wendy is angered at Stan when he suggests she gets a Photoshopped image of herself.

In ""[[Gluten Free Ebola]]"", Wendy joined the rest of the 4th-grade class in showing their displeasure toward him and [[The Boys|the boys]] after they were forced to return to school upon [[Go Fund Yourself|the failure of their start-up company]]. Stan broke up with her before the episode, citing his desire to put all his effort into the company, bragging that he'd be ""swimming in bitches"", but later regretted it. At the end of the episode, Wendy asks Stan to dance at the party, and he happily accepts her offer.

Despite their disagreements, Wendy has continued to be a girlfriend to Stan, again showing her empathy towards those around her. For example, when she helped him break his ""hoarding"" habit in ""[[Insheeption]]"", citing that it would threaten their relationship.

In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", Wendy approaches Kyle about Stan's new behavior problems. Wendy attempts to get Kyle's help to roust Stan out of his depression, but Kyle refuses to help.

[[File:SkankHunt00042.png|thumb|right|Stan and Wendy's third breakup.]]
In ""[[Skank Hunt]]"", Wendy breaks up with Stan for the third time, due to the actions of internet troll [[Skankhunt42]]. This was because all of the girls believed Skankhunt42's actions spoke for the boys' opinions. However, she shows great reluctance and a bit of sorrow over doing so, as she voiced concern over the plan, and was coerced into doing so by Annie and Nichole.

In ""[[Oh, Jeez]]"", Stan, encouraged by [[Bill Clinton]] as part of his Gentlemen's Club program, attempts to apologize to Wendy in a restaurant, and get back together with her. This meetup ends abruptly, however, when Butters spots Stan from outside the restaurant, calls him a ""traitor"" for being with a girl, and presses his penis against the glass door - an act Cosby refers to as ""pressing pickle"". Despite this, ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' implies that Stan and Wendy got back together, between the relationship chart made in the development of the game stating that they were dating, and the flirtatious dialogue between the two.

See also: ""[[Wendy's Song]]"" and ""[[Wake Up Wendy]]"", two love songs written by Stan.

In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', she had what seemed to be a crush on a newcomer named [[Gregory]]. She apparently liked him because he was very political, and shared many of her liberal opinions. After Stan followed the [[The Clitoris|Clitoris]]' advice and expressed confidence, she told Stan she had never really liked Gregory, even saying, ''""Fuck Gregory! Fuck him right in the ear!""''.

[[File:ChefGoesNanners082.png|thumb|left|Wendy kissing Cartman in ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"".]]
Wendy is one of the stronger examples of an [[Eric Cartman]] hater, but in the [[Season Four]] episode, ""[[Chef Goes Nanners]]"", she had a temporary crush on him while they were working together on the flag debate. She even dreamed of herself and Cartman falling in love together in a meadow. Frightened by these feelings, she consulted Bebe for help on the matter, and Bebe told her that it was probably just sexual tension caused by working for so long beside him. Upon her advice, Wendy passionately kissed Cartman at the presentation the next day. After that, she lost all her positive and negative feelings for him, even seeming to consider him a friend.

Her hatred for him returned eight seasons later, in the episode ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", where she fought him, and beat him up after he mocks breast cancer several points in the episode.

In ""[[The Cissy]]"", outraged by Cartman's manipulation of transgenders to use first the girl's bathroom, then get his own private bathroom. She cut her hair, wore jeans, and called herself Wendell to get back at Cartman and use his bathroom, pissing him off.

In ""[[Raisins]]"", after Wendy broke up with Stan, she began dating [[Tolkien Black]]. Their relationship likely did not last long, as Tolkien was seen with other girls in ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"". They were, however, shown riding a Ferris wheel together in ""[[The Jeffersons]]"". Afterward, they rarely interacted and were not seen together, so they probably had an off-screen breakup.

Despite their lack of interaction nowadays, in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"", Wendy tells [[Nichole Daniels]] that her supposed crush, Tolkien, is really nice and that she [[Raisins|dated him for a while]], meaning that they might still be friends after their breakup.

[[Bridon Gueermo]] is a third-grader who Wendy and the [[List of Female 4th Graders|other girls]] had a crush on in ""[[Elementary School Musical]]"". Wendy and Bridon performed many duets throughout the episode, causing Stan to become jealous. However, Wendy assured him that she would never leave him for Bridon because he could be with any girl he wanted.

﻿Kyle and Wendy worked together in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"". Wendy complimented Kyle's parenting skills, and, in the same episode, Kyle comforted her when she was missing her egg. In ""[[The List]]"", Wendy helps Kyle get the real list. Wendy also helps Kyle find [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] in ""[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]"". In ""[[Ass Burgers]]"", Kyle and Wendy talk about Stan, and two boys say ""Those two should just screw and get it over with.""

[[File:Wendy_3.png|thumb|220x220px|Wendy and Butters' bitterness for one another in ""[[The Hobbit]]""]]
Wendy and Butters are typically just neutral, but when they have rare interactions it is never good. In ""[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]"", Wendy angrily attempts to fend off Butters' attempts at persuading her to join his company after he calls her a ""bitch"". Stan Marsh intervenes, to get him to leave her alone. He also led a rebellion against her in ""[[Dances with Smurfs]]"", which resulted in Butters peeing on the side of her [[Testaburger Residence|home]].

In ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"", Wendy and Cartman plan to fight after school, and Butters originally starts out as Cartman's biggest supporter and said he wanted Cartman to ""Kick her [Wendy's] ass!"" however when the fight actually begins Butters has a change of heart and eggs Wendy on along with the entire school while she gives Cartman the beating of his life and shouts ""Fuck him up, Wendy!"".

In ""[[Marjorine]]"", Wendy is among the students who did not seem to care that Butters had seemingly died.

Their relationship reached its boiling point in ""[[The Hobbit]]"" after Butters rejected Wendy's friend, [[Lisa Berger]], by calling her ""fat"". Enraged at Butters for hurting her friend's feelings, Wendy slams Butters' locker shut and calls him an asshole. Butters admits that while Lisa seems like a nice girl, she is too overweight for him, he says he likes [[Kardashians|Kim Kardashian]] because she is beautiful. Wendy rolls up Butters' picture of Kim and throws it on the floor then storms off, but not before threatening to tell [[Mr. Mackey]] about what Butters ""said to that poor girl."" In Mr. Mackey's office, Wendy expects Butters to be in trouble but is baffled when she finds out that Mr. Mackey sides with Butters. Later in the episode, Wendy seemed to want to make peace with Butters, she politely invites him to the computer lab so she could show him how easy it is for women to photoshop images of themselves by photo-shopping an image of Lisa. He, however, mistakes that for a legitimate image of her and feels regretful for rejecting her then leaves the room.

[[File:FollowThatEgg20.jpg|thumb|Wendy with Bebe and Kyle in ""[[Follow That Egg!]]"".]] Wendy is best friends with [[Bebe Stevens]]. They have assisted each other at various times throughout the series. In ""[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]"", Bebe gave Wendy a makeover to help her impress [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], as she thought [[Ms. Ellen]] was trying to take him from her. In ""[[Clubhouses]]"", Wendy unsuccessfully attempted to help Bebe begin dating Kyle.

Though they seem to be very close friends, they have had a fair share of issues. In ""[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]"", Wendy becomes jealous of Bebe because she had become popular among the boys due to her developing breasts. However, Wendy was not the only girl to become jealous, as she was seen insulting Bebe behind her back with several other girls. Later, despite [[Mrs. Testaburger|her mother]]'s concerns, she got breast implants, presumably in order to outdo Bebe, only for her to arrive too late when the boys in class got over Bebe's breasts due to her wearing a cardboard box over her chest, causing the boys to laugh at Wendy's breast implants and call her a ""stupid bitch"".

In the episode, ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", Wendy left the party as she felt the stupid spoiled whore game was demeaning to girls and did not want to be a part of it.

In ""[[The List]]"", Bebe and Wendy get into a fight after arguing over the list of the cutest and ugliest boys. Nevertheless, they were shown to still be friends in ""[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]"". Their friendship still appears to remain alive today, as they've been shown together in the popular girls' clique in numerous instances. In addition, Bebe has a photograph of her and Wendy smiling together hung on her bedroom wall, as shown in ""[[Cartman Finds Love]]"" and ""[[Skank Hunt]]"".

Wendy acts as the leader of the female ""population"". The other girls look up to her as their voice of reason, though on some occasions, they ignore her suggestions. The most notable exception however was during ""[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]"", in which Wendy, failing to grasp the trend of being a whore, was outcast from the girls.

In ""[[The List]]"", [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] threatened her with a gun after finding out she knew about the forged list.

Wendy used the girls as hypothetical examples in railing against using Photoshop to ""improve"" women's looks in ""[[The Hobbit]]"". The girls misconstrued her remarks and thus labeled her a ""hater"", much to Wendy's frustration and eventual dejection. They appear to have reconciled in ""[[The Cissy]]"" and ""[[Cock Magic]]"" as seen when they are together.

In ""[[Clubhouses]]"", it is suggested that Wendy had boyfriends before Stan, but the number of boyfriends or who they may have been is unknown. In the episode, after Wendy suggests coming over to play Truth or Dare in Stan's clubhouse, Stan tells Wendy that he does not have a clubhouse. Wendy replies ''""You don't? I thought all guys had clubhouses.""'' Stan replies ''""Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?""''

Wendy is a playable character in the game.

Wendy is the leader of the girls and the girlfriend of [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

When [[the New Kid]] is told to recruit the girls, he is taken to the Girls' headquarters where he meets Wendy and the girls. Since the New Kid cannot talk, [[Annie Nelson|Annie]] tells her for him. Wendy says that she and the girls will play with the boys until he does a favor for her. They are under the suspicion that [[Monica Ryland]] is a two-faced bitch, but need the New Kid to pose as Bebe's boyfriend to find out for himself.

When that quest is over, Wendy gives the New Kid a new quest to check the abortion records over at the clinic to see who the two-faced bitch really is. To make the New Kid go undercover, as a girl, they give him a makeover. The New Kid then enters the abortion clinic and checks to see the records.

He then shows the records to Wendy, but it turns out that they were written in another language. The final quest she gives is to get them translated. He then shows the records to [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the others at the [[Elven Kingdom]]. Cartman tells everyone that he's seen this language before, in [[Canada|the Kingdom to the North]], and the New Kid heads over there to get the records translated by the [[Minister of Montreal]].

When all of that is over, Wendy and the girls read the translated document and find out that they belong to [[Nancy Turner]], showing that the two-faced bitch was really [[Heidi Turner]]. Wendy and the girls soon forgive Heidi, thank the New Kid for serving them well, and agree to join the boys in fighting [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]].

During the fight, she gets injured and the New Kid summons Butters to help heal her. Wendy then rewards him with a Superhero Badge.

In ""[[Safe Space]]"", the cashier pressurizes [[Randy Marsh]] to donate a dollar to feed hungry kids every time he shops at Whole Foods. He constantly guilt-trips Randy for not donating, making it extremely difficult for Randy to make his payment or collect his change. Some things Randy is forced to do are to tap on a window in a register, speak into a decoder, and pull a very tight sandwich out of the new change dispenser, a hungry girl's mouth, to collect his change. On his third trip to Whole Foods, Randy is so pressured that he decides to donate a dollar during checkout. The cashier shames him for only donating $1, making an announcement, giving Randy a $1 donor t-shirt, and pining a picture of him up on a cork board while singing ""He's a Jolly Good Fellow"". Randy leaves Whole Foods whimpering.

Following the incident, Randy makes a public service announcement against charity-shaming.

On his next trip to Whole Foods, Randy is accompanied by [[Steven Seagal]] and [[Vin Diesel]], to prevent the cashier from charity-shaming him. However, the cashier makes fun of their movies, causing both of them to walk off crying. He then asks Randy if he would like to donate again. On his final visit, Randy tells the cashier about his #ShamelessAmerica charity organization. The cashier then pressures him to  to help his pet hamster go to college.

The cashier is briefly seen again in ""[[Truth and Advertising]]"", still working as a cashier and asking [[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] to give a dollar to give hungry kids iPads.

The Whole Foods cashier has dark brown hair with gray sideburns and wrinkles on his forehead. He wears a cashier's uniform consisting of a blue striped shirt, a black Whole Foods apron, dull blue pants, and white shoes. He wears a black watch on his left wrist.

He is a confident, sarcastic bully. He smiles coolly while pressuring Randy to donate to charity, making it very difficult for him to make payment. He is able to gain the upper hand, ridiculing Steven Seagal and Vin Diesel to get them out of the way so he can continue charity-shaming Randy.

Wieners Out (Movement),https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Wieners_Out_(Movement),,"is a movement formed by [[Butters Stotch]] in the [[Wieners Out|episode of the same name]].

After his then-girlfriend, [[Charlotte]], breaks up with him via a Skype call, Butters becomes heartbroken and wants to get revenge on the girls for their mass breakup initiation that occurred in the [[Skank Hunt|preceding episode]]. As a result, he forms a movement involving him and the rest of [[South Park Elementary]]'s male populace exposing their genitalia to the public and exhibiting pride in their gender. Prior to this, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] convinces his male classmates to syncretize with the girls by attending their volleyball game.

The boys adhere to this idea, only for Butters to pull down his pants and show his genitals to the girls as they are playing volleyball; several other boys follow suit. Upon witnessing this, Kyle facepalms, realizing that his plan ultimately backfired. However, he later joins the movement after discovering that [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] has a girlfriend in the form of [[Heidi Turner]].

The movement results in complaints from the girls to [[PC Principal]], who refuses to take action, due to him thinking that doing so would be considered body shaming.

Wieners Out carries on in the following episode, as Butters is seen with his pants down when preparing to engage in a fight with [[Nelly]], who tells him to pull up his pants so they can proceed to fight, to which Butters refuses.

However, he and the rest of the boys join forces to put an end to the movement by conforming to Heidi's fundraiser consisting of selling danishes to support Denmark, wherein the Danish are being trolled online. This deal ends once Butters becomes infuriated that no one is buying their danishes and blames the boys for ""working with a bunch of stupid girls"", which results in a massive argument between the two genders, much to Heidi's disappointment.

After [[PC Principal]] makes an effort for the girls and boys to come together after the results of the preceding night's election, [[Bill Clinton]] presents himself and asks one of the boys in the audience of the assembly to join his [[Bill Clinton's Gentleman's Club|Gentleman's Club]] as a means to get the male students back with their ex-girlfriends. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] does so in order to get back with [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] as the two are seated at a restaurant, attempting to patch things up.

Butters and the other boys call him out for reconciling with a girl, deeming Stan a traitor and pressing their penises up against the window in retaliation. Later on, Butters' [[Stephen Stotch|par]][[Linda Stotch|ents]] ground him for his actions, though this consequence has no affect on him whatsoever, as he is seen pressing his wiener up against his bedroom window, thus revealing his genitals to the public.

In ""[[Members Only]]"", once he goes to [[SpaceX]] to travel to [[Mars]] with Cartman and Heidi, Butters announces that he has ended the Wieners Out movement. As a result, his personality transitions into feminism and acts of kindness, similar to Cartman's as of Season Twenty. However, this does not change his view on girls nor end the gender war, as he is still heartbroken over Charlotte.

In trying to find the 'reason' for various rich famous celebrities cheating on their wives, the government finds that the 'virus' for sexual addiction comes from an 'alien wizard' who is hiding in Independence Hall. While President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] and his strike force claim the 'alien' must be invisible since he's not there, one of the soldiers finally breaks and asks all the other men to just admit that the whole idea is just an excuse to justify their own actions. The soldier is then captured by his fellow soldiers and dressed up in a poorly made wizard alien costume.

Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] are selected to help the task force to kill the wizard alien. Giving them guns and releasing the soldier in the costume, the President, scientist, and soldiers use a strobe light to convince Kyle and Butters to shoot the soldier several times until they finally kill him. This is then used as the excuse for all the alien's ""victims"" to act as though they are ""cured"".

In costume, he appears as an oversized alien wearing a wizard's hat and beard, with human legs. Out of costume, he appears in a bulletproof vest and gray camouflage. He also wears knee guards and an earpiece on his right ear.

He appears to be intelligent, not falling for [[Barack Obama]]'s scheme mentioned above. Unfortunately, this intelligence is what got him killed.

Woodland Critters,https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Woodland_Critters,,"are deceptively cute, but truly evil satanic animals imagined by [[Eric Cartman]], as shown in the episode ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"".

They are a group of [[Satan]]-worshiping woodland animals created by Cartman in a Christmas story for a class assignment. Though they appear friendly, they can manifest ""evil Satanic powers"", such as the ability to conjure hellfire and demons. They all originally appeared in ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"", in which they attempted to bring about the birth of the [[Anti-Christ]] so that Satan can rule the world in terror, but are ultimately killed by [[Santa Claus]] when he shoots them with a shotgun one by one. However, this story in itself was an ""imaginary"" one and did not occur in the ""real world"" of the story.

The twelve critters are: Squirrely the Squirrel, Rabbity the Rabbit, Beavery the Beaver, Beary the Bear, Porcupiney the Porcupine, Skunky the Skunk, Foxy the Fox, Deery the Deer, Woodpeckery the Woodpecker, Mousey the Mouse, Raccoony the Raccoon, and Chickadee-y the Chickadee.

Most of the critters also have their own catchphrases or verbal tic; Squirrely's ""now don't be down, y'all"", Mousey's ""I deduce"", Beary's ""but we got to--"" and Chickadee-y's repeating of the last few words of her statements.

In the [[Season Eleven]] story arc ""[[Imaginationland]]"", they appeared in reality. Because they were made up by Cartman, they exist in the evil realm of [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]] and were freed when terrorists destroyed the barrier separating the benevolent imaginary characters from the evil ones. In one scene, in which other famous villains such as [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Jason Voorhees]] argue as to what to do with a captured [[Strawberry Shortcake]], the Critters disturb the other villains with their grotesque suggestions on how to mutilate, torture and kill Shortcake, with Jason Voorhees saying, ""Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt those things up."" The Critters also raped (and presumably killed) a squad of American soldiers led by [[Kurt Russell]] that had crossed into Imaginationland. They managed to make a Tron Soldier's head explode, attack and gang-rape [[Popeye]] in the final battle, but did not manage to kill him. They were eventually all put back behind the barrier to Evil Imaginationland along with the rest of the evil imaginary characters after Butters used his imagination to restore Imaginationland to the way it was before the terrorist attack.

The Woodland Critters are deceptively cute and act innocent with their actions. They all have big bulgy, shiny eyes. They also wear either colorful scarves, mittens, sweaters, or hats.

Foxy is a small orange fox who has black ears, feet, and paws, a white stomach and a portion of white near her jawline, a big bushy tail, green eyes, and wears a dark-green sweater with green trimmings. Her voice has the feel of excitement to it, and she has more of an accent. She could be based off the Red fox.

After happily being sacrificed, he has a long cut in his stomach, revealing his organs and blood that most of which were torn out by the other critters. He could be based off the Eastern cottontail.

[[File:Raccoony.png|thumb|150px]]
Raccoony is medium-sized, has dark brown fur, a lighter coffee brown on his belly, white around his muzzle, black ears, paws, and feet, a small white tuft on top of his head, a big black nose, a striped light coffee and black tail, brown eyes and a black and white ""mask"". He wears a green scarf. He is based off the Raccoon species.

[[File:Skunky.png|thumb|150px]]
Skunky is a small-medium little Skunk with a long white stripe coming down his forehead and reaching to his nose, a white stomach, and a bushy black and white striped tail, and green eyes. He wears a blue sweater and little red gloves. He could be based off the Striped skunk,

A small Woodpecker with light coffee brown feathers, an orange stomach, a cream-yellow pointed beak, small skinny grey legs, a portion of orange around her face, and dark olive patches around her brown eyes. She wears blue earmuffs. She could be based off the Pileated woodpecker, although no known woodpeckers have brown/orange plumage.

They act strangely optimistic and childlike, despite being wicked and evil. They also seem to enjoy Guro, evidenced by the fact that they had a blood orgy after sacrificing Rabbity the Rabbit in ""[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]"". They also seem to enjoy watching others suffer, as they wanted to torture Strawberry Shortcake before killing her in ""[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]"".

Most likely as a result of satanic rituals and pacts, the critters have been shown to have powerful, but evil magical powers. This includes summoning hellfire, demons and harming opponents with dark magical spells.

They originally befriended Stan, but only to manipulate him into killing the [[Mountain Lion Cubs]]' mother. After Stan realized they were Satan-worshipers, he tried to stop them, leading to them becoming enemies.

They befriended Kyle for his disbelief in Christianity, and made him a host for the [[Anti-Christ]] before being shot by [[Santa Claus]]. Kyle then agrees to insert the Anti-Christ in him to make the world respect Judaism, only to know it harmed his soul.

The Woodland Critters appear as enemies in ''South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!''. The critters are faster than the other enemies of the game and tend to deal between nine and eleven damage to players' towers. They are weak against fiery-works towers.
