'''Doctor Fate''' (also known as '''Fate''') is the name of multiple [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], the original version of the character first created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman, debuting in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 (May 1940). The character has appeared in various incarnations, with Doctor Fate being the name of several different individuals in the [[DC Universe]] who are a succession of [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerers]] with several attempts to revitalize the character.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":03"/><ref name="newsarama1" />

In the [[DC Universe]] continuity, Doctor Fate was originally conceived as a force fighting against the supernatural being [[Nabu (comics)|'''Nabu''']], a cosmic being affiliated with the Lords of Order, [[Mesopotamian deities|Mesopotamia deities]],<ref>Note: Throughout the character's history, despite being referenced in Mesopotamia as early as ''1st Issue Special'' #9, he is erroneously stated to be Egyptian.</ref> and a chief enemy of his cosmic opposites, the Lords of Chaos. Over time, Nabu instead empowered mortal agents to act on his behalf and the Lords of Order, the first being [[Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson)|'''Kent Nelson''']], the Strauss family, and various others. Other versions of the character differ, acting as solely supernatural-based heroes, affiliated with the [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lords of Chaos]], or [[Demonology|demon hunters]]. Several years after the [[The New 52|New 52]] reboot, DC Comics introduced its latest and second-longest-running incarnation, '''[[Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour)|Khalid Nassour]]''', the grandnephew of Kent Nelson chosen by [[ancient Egyptian deities]] and [[archangel]]s.

The Doctor Fate character has appeared in various incarnations across multiple forms of media based on both comic and original characters; The Kent Nelson incarnation has appeared in several media, such as the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', in which he is portrayed by [[Brent Stait]], and the upcoming [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]'', in which he will be portrayed by [[Pierce Brosnan]]. In animated media, several incarnations of Doctor Fate have appeared in the [[Young Justice (TV series)|''Young Justice'']] animated series; Nabu, Khalid Nassour and Kent Nelson's versions of Doctor Fate have appeared in the animated series alongside other original incarnations based on pre-existing characters such as [[Zatara]], [[Zatanna]], and [[Traci 13]].

==Publication history==

=== Golden Age ===
The first character to debut as Doctor Fate was Kent Nelson, who appeared in his own self-titled six page strip in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 (May 1940) during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. The character was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman, who produced the first three years of monthly Doctor Fate stories.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=[[L.G.

When the [[Justice Society of America]] was created for ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #3 (Winter 1940), Doctor Fate was one of the characters [[DC Comics#Golden Age|National Comics]] used for the joint venture with [[All-American Publications]]. He made his last appearance in the book in issue #21 (Summer 1944), virtually simultaneously with the end of his own strip in ''More Fun Comics'' #98 (July–August 1944). Aside from the annual JSA/JLA team-ups in ''Justice League of America'' that began in 1963, Doctor Fate appeared in other stories through the 1960s and 1970s, including a two-issue run with [[Hourman]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #55–56, two appearances with [[Superman]] in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #201 (March 1971) and #208 (December 1971).

=== Silver Age ===
Aside from the annual JSA/JLA team-ups in ''Justice League of America'' that began in 1963, Doctor Fate appeared in other stories through the 1960s and 1970s, including a two-issue run with [[Hourman]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #55–56, two appearances with [[Superman]] in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #201 (March 1971 and #208, December 1971); an appearance with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #156 (November 1979); and a solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #9 (December 1975), written by [[Martin Pasko]] and drawn by [[Walt Simonson]]. Doctor Fate and the rest of The Justice Society returned to ''All-Star Comics'' in 1976 with #58 for a two-year run ending with issue #74 and ''Adventure Comics'' #461-462 in 1978, and ''Adventure Comics'' #466 related the untold tale of the Justice Society's 1951 disbanding.

=== Bronze Age ===
Doctor Fate's origin was retold in ''DC Special Series'' #10, and Doctor Fate again teamed up with Superman in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #23 (July 1980), and featured in a series of back-up stories running in ''The Flash'' from #306 (February 1982) to #313 (September 1982) written by [[Martin Pasko]] (aided by [[Steve Gerber]] from #310 to #313) and drawn by [[Keith Giffen]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Riley |first=Shannon E. |date=May 2013 |title=A Matter of (Dr.) Fate Martin Pasko and Keith Giffen Discuss Their Magical ''Flash'' Backup Series |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=64 |pages=64–68}}</ref>

Beginning in 1981, DC's ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' elaborated upon the adventures of many World War II-era heroes, including Doctor Fate and the JSA. The series ran for 67 issues and three annuals, concluding in 1987. Doctor Fate made occasional modern-day appearances in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' in 1984, the same year which witnessed the 22nd and final annual Justice Society/Justice League team-up.<ref>''Justice League'' #231-232 (October–November 1984). DC Comics.</ref> Doctor Fate also made a guest appearance in a 3-issue 1985 crossover in the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #19-20 and ''Justice League'' #244. Doctor Fate then appeared in the four-part special ''America vs. the Justice Society'' (1985) which finalized the story of the Justice Society, featuring an elaboration of the events of ''Adventure Comics'' #466 and a recap of the Justice Society's annual team-ups with the Justice League. In 1985, DC collected the Doctor Fate back-up stories from ''The Flash'', a retelling of Doctor Fate's origin by [[Paul Levitz]], [[Joe Staton]], and [[Michael Netzer|Michael Nasser]] originally published in ''Secret Origins of Super-Heroes'' (January 1978) (''DC Special Series'' #10 in the indicia), the Pasko/Simonson Doctor Fate story from ''1st Issue Special'' #9, and a Doctor Fate tale from ''More Fun Comics'' #56 (June 1940), in a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''The Immortal Doctor Fate''. Doctor Fate appeared in several issues of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', after which Doctor Fate briefly joined the Justice League.<ref>''Legends'' #6 (April 1987). DC Comics.</ref>

=== Modern Age ===

==== ''Doctor Fate'' series ====
In 1987, ''Doctor Fate'' mini-series was released soon afterward, featuring the debut of Eric and Linda Strauss, who would replace the character Kent Nelson as Doctor Fate after being seemingly killed off by the antagonist of the book.<ref name="Fate19872">''Doctor Fate'' #1–4 (July–October 1987). DC Comics.</ref> Later, DC Comics would release a Doctor Fate ongoing series focusing on both characters acting simultaneously as Doctor Fate, the first twenty-four issues written and drawn by [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Shawn McManus]] starting in the winter of 1988. The series focused on magically aged up Eric and Linda acting as Doctor Fate under the guidance of Nabu, whom has inhabited and taken the identity of Kent Nelson. Despite their differences in personality and both Eric's immaturity and true age, Linda is portrayed as having feelings for Erica which are mutual.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #1 (Winter 1988).

In 1991, later issues of the series saw Kent's wife Inza take over as the new Doctor Fate with a different benefactor unlike her husband, starting with the 25th issue of the series Inza's tenure as Doctor Fate differs from Nelson in her focus on [[social class]] issues and inequality, using her powers to improve one of the poorest districts in New York City while defending it from corruption and genuine malevolent evil forces. The series ended with issue #41.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #41 (June 1992). DC Comics.</ref> Following ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', DC killed off both Kent and Inza and replaced them with a new character, Jared Stevens.

===== ''Book of Fate'' series =====
DC eventually replaced the existing Doctor Fate with a new character, Jared Stevens. Stevens was introduced in a self-titled series called ''Fate'', launched in the wake of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' in 1994.<ref name="fate0">''Fate'' #0 (October 1994)</ref> The Doctor Fate character went through a radical redesign, dropping the "Doctor" title and gaining new weapons made from the previous related artifacts of Dcotor Fate.

The character then starred in ''The Book of Fate'' written by Keith Giffen, which ran from February 1997 to January 1998 for twelve issues as part of DC's "[[Weirdoverse]]" imprint, rebooting the character's origins and adventures. In 1999, the revival of the Justice Society in ''[[Justice Society of America#JSA|JSA]]'' allowed the Doctor Fate character to be re-worked once more and subsequently killed off the Jared Stevens character.<ref name="jsa12">''JSA'' #1 (August 1999).

==== ''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 3) ====
The next incarnation of the Doctor Fate character would come in the form of Hector Hall, the son of the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawgirl. In addition to appearing in ''JSA'', DC published a self-titled, five-issue limited series in 2003.<ref>''Dr. Fate'' (vol. 3) #1–5 (October 2003–February 2004).

==== ''Countdown to Mystery''<nowiki/>'s ''Doctor Fate'' & other appearances ====
In 2007, a new incarnation of Doctor Fate, Kent V. Nelson, was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Justiniano]] and serves as an attempt to revitalize the Doctor Fate character. Unlike prior depictions, the character is instead no longer rooted in Egyptian/Mesopotamian mythology and is disassociated with the Lords of Chaos and Order due to being killed off during Infinite Crisis. Gerber also stated his intentions of not directly contradicting previous runs while raising the subject as little as possible. The character was also the grand nephew of the original Doctor Fate, establishing a connection to the most recognized Doctor Fate.<ref name=":03">{{cite web |last=McLauchlin |first=Jim |date=2006-12-03 |title=A Twist of Fate |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002578766.cfm |website=Wizard |access-date=2007-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212102237/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002578766.cfm |archive-date=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref name=":14">{{cite web |date=2007-03-03 |title=Some Thoughts on Doctor Fate – Part 1 |url=http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=283 |url-status=dead |website=stevegerberblog |access-date=2011-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716174624/http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=283 |archive-date=2011-07-16}}</ref> Due to Steve Gerber's death, the seventh issue was written by [[Adam Beechen]] using Gerber's notes.

Following the events of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' mini-series in 2011, DC's continuity was [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed.

====DC You & DC Rebirth-onward====
{{see also|DC You|DC Rebirth}} 
After the conclusion of the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' limited series in June 2015, DC launched a new ''Doctor Fate'' ongoing series, written by [[Paul Levitz]] and drawn by [[Sonny Liew]] as part of the DC You initiative, which saw an emphasis on "story over continuity", loosening the restrictions of continuity to allow for a diverse range of genres while some characters underwent status quo changes. The title focused on the newest and most recent incarnation of Doctor Fate, an [[Egyptian American|Egyptian-American]] medical student named Khalid Nassour.<ref name="newsarama1">{{cite web |date=2015-04-16 |title=LEVITZ Channels DITKO For June's New, Unusual DR.

Both Khalid and Kent would simultaneously act as Doctor Fate, the former being his apprentice to prepare to fully inherit the role. The series ran for 18 issues from June 2015 to November 2016.<ref>{{cite web |date=2015-08-01 |title=GCD :: Series :: Doctor Fate |url=https://www.comics.org/series/90250/ |access-date=2017-02-20 |publisher=Comics.org}}</ref>

In 2018, DC launched a second ''Justice League Dark'' series written by [[James Tynion IV]] starring a new roster led by Wonder Woman. In this roster, Khalid and Kent Nelson were revealed to be eventual new members of the Justice League, originally acting as "advisors" in the team and became reoccurring characters. Nassour would eventually permanently become the new Doctor Fate instead of Kent Nelson in the "Lords of Order" storyline. Nassour would also receive a new redesign as Doctor Fate.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sharp |first=Kevin |date=2018-06-11 |title=James Tynion IV Reveals New Justice League Dark Characters And Villain |url=https://dccomicsnews.com/2018/06/11/james-tynion-iv-reveals-new-justice-league-dark-characters-and-villain/ |access-date=2022-02-05 |website=DC Comics News |language=en-US}}</ref> Nelson's character would be later killed off in the "A Costly Trick of Magic" storyline, leaving Nassour as the sole Doctor Fate character in present times. While the original 2018 series was cancelled in 2020, the ''Justice League Dark'' series was instead re-purposed as a backup issue to the mainstream ''Justice League'' title, the backup issue written by author [https://imagecomics.com/creators/ram-v Ram V] featuring a new storyline with Khalid remaining a reoccurring member of the Justice League Dark subdivision.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnston |first=Rich |date=2020-12-18 |title=Justice League Dark Series Cancelled, Repurposed As Back-Up Strip |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/justice-league-dark-series-cancelled-repurposed-as-back-up-strip/ |access-date=2022-02-05 |website=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors |language=en}}</ref> Khalid would also appear in several title crossovers such as ''Superman'', ''Teen Titans Academy'', and ''The Flash''.

In 2021, Khalid Nassour would appear in major storylines such as the Justice League Dark's "The Great Wickedness" storyline, depicting a status quo change in which the Helm of Fate is damaged from a previous battle with the villain, Upside-Down Man, and is inhabited by a new entity.<ref name="DC COMICS">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1269618795 |title=JUSTICE LEAGUE DARK THE GREAT WICKEDNESS. |date=2022 |publisher=DC COMICS |isbn=978-1-77951-551-3 |location=[S.l.] |oclc=1269618795}}</ref> Connected to the [[Future State]] crossover event depicting an older Khalid Nassour having lived through the aftermath of the events of the "Great Wickedness" storyline, the entity is revealed to be the Egyptian goddess, Hauhhet.<ref name="DC COMICS" /> Nassour would also play a role in the ''Justice League''/''Justice League Dark'' crossover involving the return of the character, Xanadoth.

==Incarnations==

=== Nabu ===
{{Main|Nabu (comics)}}

In recent continuities, Nabu's time on Earth with his own physical body is the first person to be called Doctor Fate. In the ''Blue Beetle'' series, he is depicted in the past having one battle the Blue Beetle's scarab, Khaji-Da and the demigod Arion, once a fellow Lord of Order corrupted due to Khaji-Da (later stories retconned this reasoning) and their promise to protect his beloved city.  He defeats Arion but the scarab escapes his grasp. He would later resume using the name in the modern era in an ensuing conflict between himself, Jaime Reyes, and a resurrected Arion. During this time-frame, he had used his successor, Kent Nelson, to manifest on the physical plane due to his physical body having deteriorated long after the initial conflict between Arion and the scarab centuries ago.<ref name=":10">{{Cite book |last=Giffen |first=Keith |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/837140933 |title=Hard choices |date=2017 |others=J.

=== Kent Nelson ===
{{Main|Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson)}}

The original Doctor Fate, Kent Nelson is a Swedish-American who discovered the tomb of Nabu with his father. Having accidentally killed his father due to a deadly gas released from his tomb, the Lord of Order felt pity for the child and trained him in the ways of magic for two decades, bequeathing him his mystical amulet, helmet, and cloak, as well as all of his knowledge before Nelson started his career as a mystic superhero. He was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2021-03-07|title=DC Universe Infinite Encyclopedia: Doctor Fate|url=https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com/encyclopedia/doctor-fate/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307110104/https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com/encyclopedia/doctor-fate/|archive-date=2021-03-07|access-date=2022-02-24}}</ref>

Kent Nelson in the newly revised continuity is the first mortal host to be Doctor Fate. He retains his original origin from the previous continuity and some of his earlier adventures. This version of Nelson is treated more callously by Nabu overall, used initially as an unconscious host to materialize himself onto the physical plane due to no longer having a body to create for himself. Nelson eventually regains control of his body in an ensuing magical conflict involving one of Nabu's former allies. He would come to find his apprentice and successor in the form of his great nephew, Khalid Nassour, who was chosen by Nabu's allies, the Egyptian Gods, to become Doctor Fate.

Born to a wealthy billionaire Henry Strauss and Rebecca Stauss, the latter whom was abusive to his wife and Eric himself. Selected as a future agent of order, Eric grew up aware of the existence of the Lords of Order, giving him a level of enhanced mystical awareness although it resulted in him possessing an abnormal personality that made him unable to interact with children his own age. He also possessed a special connection to his step-mother Linda due to the both of them being selected as future agents of order.<ref name="Fate1987">''Doctor Fate'' #1–4 (July–October 1987)</ref>

At the age of ten, Eric was chosen as Nabu's next agent of order to inherit the Doctor Fate mantle, subquentionally aging up the boy in a similar manner to Nelson before although this time, Eric's mind did not mature.<ref name="Fate1987" /> He would act as Doctor Fate alongside Linda, the two often merging in order to become Doctor Fate. Nabu goes on to possess Kent's corpse in order to personally advise them.<ref name="Fate1987" /> The three of them are soon joined by a friendly demon called Petey and lawyer Jack C. Small.<ref name=":9">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #2 (December 1988)</ref><ref name="Fate1987" />

Overtime, despite Eric's mind being similar to a child of ten years old, Linda developed romantic feelings for her step-son while Eric reciprocated such feelings.  Eric is eventually killed on [[Apokolips]] during a battle with [[Desaad]], forcing Linda to become Doctor Fate on her own.<ref name=":5" /> Linda is killed soon afterward by the [[Lords of Chaos and Order#Lords of Chaos|Lords of Chaos]].

'''Inza Cramer-Nelson''' (also '''Inza Saunders''') debuted in ''More Fun Comics'' #55 in 1940, created by created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman. Originally, the character was created as a love interest for Kent Nelson, the original character to have starred as Doctor Fate. She would eventually become the fourth character to bear the Doctor Fate name and the second female character to become Doctor Fate.

In a scheme to lure in Doctor Fate, Inza was kidnapped by the scientific villain, Wotan. Inza and Doctor Fate meet, the woman enamoured with a life potentially filled with adventure and would accompany Doctor Fate as his partner. Eventually, Kent Nelson revealed his identity to her and she would support him when he became a medical doctor, accompanying him as a nurse.

At some point, she also pursued a doctorate in archaeology similarly to her husband.<ref name=":13" />

Later, the two would marry, the magics of the Tower of Fate keeping them young. Overtime, their marriage became strained due to Nabu's influence on Doctor Fate and Inza coming to resent having to be in a passive role within the Tower of Fate, resulting in a loss of a social life. Despite later having some romantic feelings for another man, Inza ultimately remained faithful to Kent with intent on working through their martial problems.<ref name=":13">{{Cite book |last=Pasko |first=Martin |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/920677015 |title=The Immortal Doctor Fate |date=2016 |others=Keith Giffen, Walter Simonson |isbn=978-1-4012-5876-4 |location=Burbank, CA |oclc=920677015}}</ref> 

Eventually, Inza and Nelson would be killed in the wake of the cosmic event known as kali yuga, the Lords of Chaos empowered and weakening Nabu, rapidly aging both of them and the strain being too much for Inza to bear. Eventually, Nelson too was killed and in the aftermath, the two would live out their afterlfie within the Amulet of Anubis for a time, the pair creating the life they missed out in their lifetime in the dimension, including a child.

Eventually, the pair are resurrected into younger bodies and Inza becomes the sole Doctor Fate for a time, unable to merge with Nelson. As Doctor Fate, Inza's methods are more proactive although she becomes more reckless in their use, stemming a temporary separation from Kent. The two reconcile their differences upon learning Inza's patron as Doctor Fate originating from a Lord of Chaos, making her an agent of chaos.  The Chaos Lord revealing himself to have subtly influenced some events enough to cause the two to have strife against one another and enjoyed having the Lords of Chaos be a force of good, reasoning that even Chaos Lords did not find evil as favorable. The Chaos Lord would relinquish the powers bestowed to Inza back to himself although she would replace her chaos magic with magics stemming from life and continued acting as Doctor Fate, with Nelson acting alongside her.<ref name="df25">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #25 (February 1991)</ref><ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #26–32 (March 1991–September 1991)</ref> When operating as separate Doctor Fates, Inza wears the helmet and Kent's original costume while Kent wears the half helmet and costume he used in the late 1940s.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #36 (January 1992)</ref> Sometime later, the Nelsons and the JSA face the supervillain [[Hank Hall#Zero Hour: Extant|Extant]] during [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'s attempt to change the history of the universe.

The character was created as the fifth incarnation of the Doctor Fate character. Unlike other depictions of the character, he is instead referred to as simply '''Fate'''. As opposed to being a traditional sorcerer and spell-caster, he is instead cast similarly to a demon hunter and has the most radical of designs compared to other incarnations of Doctor Fate. This incarnation was considered an unpopular reinvention of the character.<ref name=":6" />

After retiring, the Nelsons hire smuggler Jared Stevens to recover the helmet, amulet, and cloak from an Egyptian tomb. When the Nelsons try to collect the artifacts, they are murdered by two demons. During the battle, Jared attempts to use the amulet as a weapon, which then explodes and imbues him with various magical abilities and a red ankh-shaped scar over his right eye. Jared's injuries force him to use the cloak as a wrap for his right arm and to melt the helmet into a set of ankh-shaped darts and a dagger for use as weapons. After defeating the demons, Jared is contacted by Nabu, who attempts to make Jared the new Doctor Fate. Jared refuses and escapes, becoming a demon hunter using the alias "Fate".

The latest incarnation of Doctor Fate prior to the [[The New 52|New 52 reboot]], the character debuted in the first issue of ''Countdown to Mystery'' in 2007 as an attempt to revitalize the character; unlike other Doctor Fates, the character lacks any connections to Nabu and either of the Lords of Order or Lords of Chaos, as the two factions were killed off in a previous storyline. In addition, the character's powers is not tied to any known mythology, making the Doctor Fate character exclusively a mystic superhero.<ref name=":03"/><ref name=":14"/>

A [[psychiatrist]] and the grand-nephew of Kent Nelson, the character would lose his status following his infidelity leading to a divorce, leading to depression and losing his license following negligent practices in the workplace.

== Powers, abilities, and resources ==
Nearly synonymous among all the bearers (with the exception being Jared Stevens), Doctor Fate is considered a powerful sorcerer nearly unmatched in the art of spell-casting in the DC Universe; with the combined might of all artifacts associated with Nabu, Doctor Fate is said to possess nearly unstoppable magical abilities (flight, teleportation, dimensional travelling, invisibility, necromancy, etc.). While not present in all bearers, the majority of Doctor Fate's magic and abilities appear in the form of an [[ankh]]. Though all bearers vary in actual skill, the Helm of Fate grants all Doctor Fates to have sufficient mystic power that potentially makes them among the most powerful practitioners of magic within DC Universe's Earth.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Scott |first=Melanie |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1089398386 |title=DC ultimate character guide |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-4654-7975-4 |edition=New |location=New York, New York |oclc=1089398386}}</ref><ref name=":2" />

=== Mystic artifacts ===
==== Helmet of Fate ====
The Helmet of Fate (sometimes called the '''Helm of Fate''', '''Helmet of Anubis''', '''Helmet of Thoth''', or '''Helm of Thoth''') is a magical [[Corinthian helmet|corinthian]] helmet that grants the bearer godly level powers and is considered one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the [[DC Universe]]. While most continuities establish it to be a creation of [[Nabu (comics)|Nabu]], the fourth ''Doctor Fate'' series presents a different origin, the helm instead associated with [[Thoth]] and is presented with an altered origin, the object of power being rooted in the DC's version of Egyptian mythology; being a creation of [[Osiris]] and Thoth's hand, it was created in order to trap Nabu, who once served alongside Thoth for reasons not revealed.<ref name=":12" />

Acting as a respository of  magical energy, the helm was constructed using the fictitious metal known as Nth metal, granting it mystical properties as well as some anti-magic properties against those of magical origin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Snyder |first=Scott |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1061866233 |title=Dark nights : metal |date=2019 |others=Greg Capullo, Jonathan Glapion, Fco Plascencia, Mikel Janín, Jorge Jiménez, Doug Mahnke |isbn=978-1-4012-8858-7 |location=Burbank, CA |oclc=1061866233}}</ref> Bearing the helm allows for magical capabilitiy (spell-casting) and grant it's user’s numerous powers: flight, healing, and the manipulation of the natural elements (wind, earth, water, fire, and lightning).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1253363543 |title=The DC comics encyclopedia : the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe |publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK Publishing]] |last1=Manning |first1=Matthew K. |last2=Wiacek |first2=Stephen |last3=Scott |first3=Melanie |last4=Jones |first4=Nick |last5=Walker |first5=Landry Q. |last6=Cowsill |first6=Alan |year=2021 |isbn=978-0-7440-2056-4 |edition=New |location=New York, New York |language=en |oclc=1253363543}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The helm also contains a vast library of spells in which the user can draw from,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Willingham |first=Bill |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/567099447 |title=Justice Society of America : axis of evil |date=2010 |publisher=DC Comics |others=Travis Moore, Jesús.

However, the Helm of Fate is not completely impervious, as powerful entities (i.e [[Arion (character)|Arion]], [[Brimstone (DC Comics)|Brimstone]]) have shown the ability to damage the helm itself enough to require regeneration, showcasing a vulnerability to powerful forms of magic and applications from the Firestorm matrix.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":15" /> The helm can also be overload with magical power, rendering much of it's power inert; this took place during the ''A Costly Trick of Magic'' storyline when Nabu and Nelson sacrificed themselves to creating a spell powerful enough to injure Upside-Down Man, leaving Khalid's incarnation of Doctor Fate unable to call upon it's powers.<ref>{{Cite book |last=V |first=Ram |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1198086664 |title=A costly trick of magic |date=2021 |others=James, IV Tynion, Amancay Nahuelpan, Kyle Hotz, Álvaro Martínez Bueno, Raul Fernandez, June Chung |isbn=978-1-77950-714-3 |location=Burbank, CA |oclc=1198086664}}</ref>

===== Patron entities' powers =====
While the Helm of Fate itself is a magical artifact suffused with potent magical power, the Helm can also house an entity to act as a patron; each patron of the Helm of Fate allows certain incarnations of Doctor Fate to access unique abilities and powers as well as exert a level of influence onto its bearers:

*'''Nabu''': The most commonly depicted patron; A powerful Lord of Order and often the creator of the Helmet of Fate, Nabu's patronage allows for the bearer to have potential access to all of his knowledge and can assist his bearers with his insight and thoughts. However, Nabu can also usurp control of his bearer's will by force, pitting him at odds with some of his hosts.
* '''Chaos''': Inza Cramer's version of Doctor Fate was later revealed to be powered by a Lord of Chaos simply known as "Chaos". Chaos's patronage allows Doctor Fate to practice chaos magic, allowing them the ability to perform magic powered by imagination.<ref name=":4" /> Later establishment of chaos magic refer to this form of magic as a form of magic that requires no system (sigils, chanting, etc.) to perform.<ref name=":8" /> Chaos would claim that his influence over Inza was subtle and typically allowed free will due to believing the evil she fought being an opponent to the Lord of Chaos's objectives inherently along with amusement over the confusion of the Lords of Chaos fighting evil.<ref name=":4" /> 
* '''Hauhet''': Khalid Nassour's version of Doctor Fate would later have the Egyptian deity inhabit the helm. Due to her divine sphere of influence within space and time, the Helm of Fate is capable of seeing through multiple timelines although much of it's abilities is shown in a damage state, costing some of the bearer's sight to see into the future.<ref>{{Cite book |last=V |first=Ram |title=Justice League Dark: The Great Wickedness |publisher=DC Comics |others=Dan Watters, Sumit Kumar, Xermanico, Christopher Mitten, José, Jr. Marzán, Romulo Fajardo |year=2022 |isbn=978-1-77951-551-3 |location=Burbank, CA |oclc=}}</ref> The Future State event showcases the helm's repaired power with Hauhet as it's patron, allowing the bearer to see both different timelines and experience them individually without costing the bearer's sight.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Altbacker |first=E.

==== Amulet of Anubis ====
The '''Amulet of Anubis''' (sometimes called the '''Amulet of Nabu''' or the '''Amulet of Thoth''') is an [[amulet]] that was once bestowed to Anubis's most devout follower, being created by the death god himself. The amulet itself is automatically granted to those who bear the Helm of Fate, bestowed to them alongside the magical cloak. The amulet affords several abilities, including resistance to psychic/astral probing, allows for mind control, and bolsters a user's magical power.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Pasko |first=Martin |title=1st Issue Special #9 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1975}}</ref> While seldomly used by Doctor Fate himself, the amulet also allows for the wearer to call upon the decease spirits, allowing him to commune with spirits<ref>{{Cite book |last=Joyner |first=Tom |title=Doctor Fate (vol. 2) #38 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1992}}</ref> as well as houses its own universe  separate from the main universe, allowing the wearer to hide their existence or to trap powerful entities within.

The amulet's history was revised several times; in one story, the Amulet of Anubis was a powerful artifact forged by the Lords of Order at the dawn of time, being so powerful the Lords of Chaos formerly sought the artifact themselves. Eventually, it came into Nabu's possession to be granted to his chosen agent.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pasko |first=Martin |title=The Flash #306 / Immortal Doctor Fate #2 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1981}}</ref>

==== Other artifacts ====

* '''Cloak of Destiny''': A magical cloak with mystic properities; the cloak is both fireproof<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fox |first=Garnder |title=More Fun Comics #57 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1940}}</ref> and highly resistant towards some forms of magic in the [[DC Universe]]; Jared Stevens notably used it to suppress the chaos magic that infected his arm.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Giffen |first=Keith |title=The Book of Fate #3 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1997}}</ref>
* '''Orb of Nabu''': An orb-like device used by Doctor Fate in order to search for unknown threats, functioning similarly to a [[scrying]] glass. Despite its naming and Doctor Fate's association with magic, it is one of the few devices he uses not explicitly magic; the crystals that make up the orb are considered radio sensitive and react to his brain when in use. Though technological in nature, Doctor Fate often uses it and his magic in order to discern what is being hidden from them.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fox |first=Gardner F. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144226065 |title=The golden age Doctor Fate archives.

* '''Globes of Power''': Magically constructed globes used by the Inza Cramer incarnation of Doctor Fate, created as a method of helping others without needing to directly intervene with other citizens during her tenure in New York. The globes are powered by Doctor Fate's magic and act in a similar manner to AI, able to perform simple magical fixes or alert her to threats requiring her attention.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Messner-Loebs |first=William |title=Doctor Fate (1988-1992) #32 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1991}}</ref>
* '''Staff of Power''': A mystical staff gifted to Khalid Nassour's incarnation of Doctor Fate by [[Thoth]] powered by the blood of a pharaoh. It allows for energy projection-related powers. Only the Khalid Nassour version of Doctor Fate can use it due to his pharaoh lineage.<ref name=":12" />
* '''Throwing Ankhs''': Bladed weaponry created and molded from a melted down Helm of Fate. Mainly used by the Jared Stevens incarnation, they allow Jared to harm both magical and non-magical beings. He can also summon them back to his persons at will. After his death, the weaponry returned to its original form

=== Tower of Fate ===
The '''Tower of Fate''' (also called the '''Fortress of Fate''') is the magical dwelling bestowed to bearers of the Doctor Fate mantle. The tower acts as a nexus point of magic and reality on Earth. It has no doors or windows, being only accessible by magic. The inside of the tower appears as a twisted maze of stairways and hallways in which the laws of physics do not apply.<ref name=":1" /> The Tower holds a large collection of arcane texts within its personal library, including materials saved from the Great Library of Alexandria prior to its burning. In addition, the Tower itself possess mystical defenses, including once having a protector in the form of Typhon, a Lord of Chaos who was an enemy of Doctor Fate and later protectred the Tower from intruders.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goyer |first=David S. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51448984 |title=JLA, JSA : virtue and vice |date=2002 |others=Geoff Johns, Jesús Merino, Carlos Pacheco |isbn=1-56389-937-X |location=New York |oclc=51448984}}</ref>

=== Weaknesses ===
Despite the character's portrayal of powers, Doctor Fate has several weaknesses dependent on the incarnation:

* Removal the Helm of Fate on Doctor Fate can remove their powers or limit their abilities severely;<ref name=":11">{{Cite book |last=Willingham |first=Bill |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/567099447 |title=Justice Society of America : axis of evil |date=2010 |publisher=DC Comics |others=Travis Moore, Jesús. Merino, Dan Green, Jesse Delperdang |isbn=978-1-4012-2901-6 |location=New York |oclc=567099447}}</ref> several incarnations of Doctor Fate suffer from this weakness, including both the original Kent Nelson (whom can only cast a limited amount of spells alone and possess no power to channel magic without a Lord of Order patron)<ref>{{Cite book |last=Messner-Loebs |first=William |title=Doctor Fate v2 #36 |publisher=DC Comics |year=1992}}</ref> and his grand-nephew, Kent V. Nelson.<ref name=":11" />

* Due to the "rules of magic", Doctor Fate is unable to cast counter spells against himself to nullify another spell after they've been cast, the character only able to use his powers to protect him from the effects of whatever spell has been cast afterwards. This limitation is present on Kent Nelson's incarnation of Doctor Fate.<ref name=":2" /><ref>''Justice League of America'' #38 (September 1965)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' #148 (November 1977)</ref> 
* The Kent Nelson incarnation of Doctor Fate has also fallen victim to gas attacks and lack of oxygen without magical protections.
* Divine sources can also disrupt the abilities bestowed to Doctor Fate's incarnations, namely their healing abilities. This weakness has been seen with Khalid Nassour's incarnation of Doctor Fate<ref name=":12" />

Hesitant on accepting himself as Nabu's vessel since, he is later coerced when Wotan kidnaps him, Jay Garrick (Flash), and Jay's mother in order to force Khalid to retrieve the Helm within the Tower of Fate, which cannot be accessed by anyone else other than himself and those in his proximity. Inspired by Flash's heroism and bravery, he chooses to become Nabu's agent of order and chaos, christening himself "Doctor Fate".

This version features different origins for those who hold the mantle, some of whom are based on existing magic-related characters within DC Comics. Unlike the other incarnations of Doctor Fate, the mantle is the alter ego of Nabu, who became a Lord of Order.
** Nabu (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]])<ref name="Denial">{{cite episode |title=Denial |series=Young Justice |credits=Tom Pugsley (writer) and Michael Chang (director) |network=[[Cartoon Network]] |air-date=February 18, 2011 |season=1 |number=7}}</ref> was originally a son of [[Vandal Savage]] who was regarded in Mesopotamian mythology as [[Marduk]] and a god of wisdom before he was killed due to Savage's alliance with Lords of Chaos member [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] and spiritually ascended as a Lord of Order. Following this, Nabu must anchor himself to Earth via a physical host, whom he completely overwrites as a requirement for those whom bear his helm, and has taken many hosts over the succeeding millennia.
** Kent Nelson (voiced by [[Edward Asner]]) is a retired member of the [[Justice Society of America]] and mentor to [[Zatara|Giovanni Zatara]] who ceased being Nabu's host due to its effects on Nelson's marriage. Despite being killed by Klarion, Nelson temporarily confines his spirit to the Helm of Fate and grants it to members of the [[List of Young Justice characters#"The Team"|Team]] so they can use it for emergencies.
** While in possession of the Helm of Fate, Team members '''[[Kaldur'ahm|Aqualad]]''' and '''[[Wally West|Kid Flash]]''' temporarily take up the mantle of Doctor Fate before Nelson's spirit convinces Nabu to release them. After '''[[Zatanna]]''' dons the helm to fight Klarion however, Nabu refuses to relinquish her until '''Zatara''' convinces Nabu to take him instead. As of [[Young Justice: Outsiders|season three]], Nabu agreed to allow Zatara and Zatanna to reunite annually for one hour.
** In season four, Zatanna forms the '''[[Sentinels of Magic]]''', which includes [[Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour)|Khalid Nassour]] (voiced by Usman Ally) and '''[[Traci Thirteen|Traci Thurston]]''' (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]), to free Zatara and convince Nabu to alternate between all of them.
