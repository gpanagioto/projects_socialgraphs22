All right, that was "Get This Party Started" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys? Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct? Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel? All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question? All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy! Next caller, what's your question? Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment? All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys? Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller. All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead. Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air. Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?
