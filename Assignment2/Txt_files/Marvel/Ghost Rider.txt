'''Ghost Rider''' is the name of multiple [[antihero]]es and [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  Marvel had previously used the name for a [[Western comics|Western]] character whose name was later changed to [[Phantom Rider]].

The first [[supernatural]] Ghost Rider is [[stunt]] [[motorcycle|motorcyclist]] '''[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]''', who, to save the life of his father, agrees to give his soul to "[[Satan]]" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]). At night and when around evil, Blaze finds his flesh consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields blasts of hellfire from his body, usually from his skeletal hands. He eventually learns he has been bonded with the demon [[Zarathos]]. Blaze is featured in the ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' series from 1972 to 1983.

The subsequent ''Ghost Rider'' series (1990–1998) features '''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]''' as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s, Ketch comes in contact with a motorcycle that contains the essence of a Spirit of Vengeance. Blaze reappears in this 1990s series as a [[supporting character]], and it is later revealed that Danny and his sister were Johnny Blaze's long-lost siblings. In 2000s comics, Blaze succeeds Ketch, becoming Ghost Rider again. In 2014, '''[[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]]''' becomes Ghost Rider as part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative.

In May 2011, Ghost Rider placed 90th on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" list.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/90 |title=Ghost Rider is number 90 |publisher=IGN |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref> [[Nicolas Cage]] starred as the Johnny Blaze incarnation of the character in the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' and its 2012 sequel, ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]''. [[Gabriel Luna]] and Tom McComas portray the [[Robbie Reyes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Robbie Reyes]] and Johnny Blaze incarnations in the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth season]] of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''

==Fictional character biography==

===Johnny Blaze===
{{Main|Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)}}
Following the [[Phantom Rider|Western comics character]] who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, '''Johnny Blaze''', debuted in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' issue #5 (Aug. 1972), created by Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/marvel-legend-roy-thomas-visited-stan-lee-days-before-his-death-heres-what-happened|title=Marvel legend Roy Thomas visited Stan Lee days before his death.

He received his own series in 1973, with [[penciller]] [[Jim Mooney]] handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a considerably long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through issue #58. The series ran through issue #81 (June 1983). Blaze returned as Ghost Rider in a 2001 six-issue miniseries written by [[Devin Grayson]]; a second miniseries written by [[Garth Ennis]] in 2005, and an ongoing monthly series that began publication in July 2006. Johnny Blaze was the son of Naomi Blaze and Barton Blaze, Naomi being the previous Ghost Rider.

===Danny Ketch===
{{Main|Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)}}
The next Ghost Rider, a young man named '''Daniel''' "'''Danny'''" '''Ketch''' (Johnny Blaze's long-lost younger brother), debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather [[leather jacket|biker jacket]] with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider and the demon with which he was bonded, Ketch and his demon — who in (vol. 2) #91 (Dec. 1997) is revealed to be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment — are cooperative with each other. At the close of the series with (vol. 2) #93 (Feb. 1998), Ketch apparently died. The following year, however, ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man#Volume One (1990-1998)|Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as ''Ghost Rider Finale'' (Jan. 2007), which reprints the last issue and the previously unpublished (vol. 2) #94.<ref>While the [[trademark]]ed cover logo reads ''Ghost Rider'' #94, the comic's postal [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] lists the comic [[copyrighted]] as ''Ghost Rider Finale''.</ref>

===Alejandra Jones===
During the 2011 storyline "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]", a Nicaraguan woman named '''Alejandra Jones''' becomes Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam. Though she demonstrates many previously unknown powers of the Ghost Rider entity, she is deprived of its full power when Johnny Blaze takes back most of this power.{{issue|date=May 2018}}
She was killed by Carnage during the [[Absolute Carnage]] event.

===Robbie Reyes===
{{Main|Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)}}
In 2014, a new character took on the ''Ghost Rider'' mantle: a [[Mexican-American]] resident of [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] named '''Roberto''' "'''Robbie'''" '''Reyes''', who drives a black classic muscle car reminiscent of a modified [[1969 Dodge Charger]] rather than a motorcycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/marvels-ghost-racers-rev-up-for-secret-wars-battleworld-arena/|title=Marvel's "Ghost Racers" Rev Up for "Secret Wars'" Battleworld Arena|date=February 20, 2015|website=CBR}}</ref><ref>Montgomery (October 13, 2013).

[http://www.newsarama.com/20276-under-the-hood-of-the-all-new-ghost-rider-character-design.html].</ref>

===Michael Badilino===
'''Michael Badilino''', an ex-member of the [[New York City Police Department]], is one-third of an "Organic Medallion of Power"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance also took on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.

Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences.

===Kushala===
In the nineteenth century, while her tribe was being attacked by the U.S. Army, Kushala's parents were killed and, in an act of rage, she prayed to her creator, but instead was possessed by a Spirit of Vengeance. Then she burnt everyone until all that remained were their spirits. After becoming possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance, Kushala traveled the world seeking out and studying different forms of magic in an attempt to cure herself. Her skills in the mystic arts eventually led to her becoming the Sorcerer Supreme of her era.

==Powers and abilities==
The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a skeletal superhuman wreathed in ethereal flame and given supernatural powers. The abnormal motorcycle he rides can travel faster than any conventional vehicle and perform impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface, across water, and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles cannot. The Ghost Riders are virtually indestructible and notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain (knives are shown to melt while in their body).<ref>''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)]]''</ref> It is possible that they are genuinely immortal, as it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heavens On Fire'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite being composed of bone and hellfire, the Ghost Riders possess formidable superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25 tons (50,000&nbsp;lbs) (or more as seen in [[World War Hulk]]).<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him or her.

;[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]: Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a different appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. His hellfire "burns the soul" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the "Penance Stare." In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During "World War Hulk", it was stated by [[Doctor Strange]] that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the "Green Scar" persona of [[Hulk]] and could possibly defeat him. During this series, Doctor Strange also states that Ghost Rider protects only the innocent, which none of the Illuminati are. In recent comics, Blaze's Ghost Rider has been given the "Penance Stare" and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch. Now, he also has new abilities including hellfire breath, the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest, and the ability to travel between incorporeal realms.

;[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]: When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains with a dollar, gray leather pants, and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional one into a high-tech motorcycle (this transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he was found in the cemetery with as he was once seen able to transform another cycle in "Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness"). Along with flaming wheels that allow the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel's most famous power was the ''Penance Stare.'' By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. However, some beings have shown resistance to this ability, such as [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] as their alien [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] "costumes" do not technically have eyes; and [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]], who is so [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]], he claims to enjoy the experience. In the 1994 Fantastic Four animated series, this ability was shown to be powerful enough to bring down the mighty Galactus, as Ghost Rider forced Galactus to feel the pain of all those who had died as a result of his feeding on their planets; as Ghost Rider put it, "A billion souls". This display of power, though, appeared to simply be a rewrite for the animated series, as the original storyline in ''Fantastic Four'' issue 243 has Doctor Strange casting a spell that causes all of the souls of those Galactus had killed by his feedings to be visited upon him at once. Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when "innocent blood was spilled" (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone.

;[[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]]: The ghost of Eli Morrow that inhabits Robbie's body is not, according to Johnny Blaze, a true Spirit of Vengeance. Regardless, he gives Robbie several abilities similar to that of other Ghost Riders, including the power to manifest and control chains ending in thin knives or sickles.<ref>''All New Ghost Rider'' #5. Marvel Comic.</ref> The black muscle car that Morrow's ghost initially inhabits is linked to Robbie's Ghost Rider form, allowing him to instantly teleport to and/or merge with the car. The car can also be driven remotely, and Robbie's Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car's trunk, when opened, acts as a portal, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location. Though it is initially unknown if Robbie's Ghost Rider form possesses the divine powers of his predecessors, he eventually displays the ability to use the Penance Stare during a battle with [[Star Brand]].<ref name="ReferenceA">''Marvel Legacy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eli is able to take full control of Robbie's body when the teen gives in to his negative emotions, signified by a pallid skin tone and both of his eyes turning orange. His Ghost Rider form also displays the ability to change into a more powerful and demonic form when Robbie is sufficiently angered.<ref>''Robbie Reyes: Ghost Rider'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the end of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', to prevent the [[Darkhold]] from being used again, he slung his flaming chains in the same manner as a [[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Sling Ring]], allowing him to travel and take the book with him for safekeeping.

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==
===Naomi Kale===
Naomi Kale is the mother of Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch, and Barbara Ketch.

===Noble Kale===
Noble lived in the 18th century and grew up with his abusive father Pastor Kale and his younger brother Dante.

Noble fell in love with a black girl named Magdelena. But, because of the color of her skin and his father's strong religious views, the couple kept their love a secret from the world. They were forced to tell Pastor Kale when Magdelena bore Noble's child. Noble and Magdelena were then married.

Shortly after the marriage, Magdelena discovered Pastor Kale's dark secret; he was a servant of the dark lord Mephisto. In order to cover up Magdelena's findings, Pastor Kale accused her of witchcraft and had her burned at the stake. Knowing that his son, Noble, would object, he had him drugged, tortured and beaten in the church cellar.

Just before Magdelena died, she used a curse to summon demons that avenge wronged women. The demons were called "Furies" and they started killing the townspeople. Fearing death, Pastor Kale struck a deal with Mephisto. In return for his safety, Mephisto got Noble's soul. Mephisto realized that Noble was attached to a piece of the Medallion of Power and he activated the piece to transform Noble into the original "Spirit of Vengeance". When Ghost Rider had destroyed the Furies, Pastor offered him human flesh - Noble's son. Noble, in the guise of Ghost Rider, was unwilling to eat his own child and he killed himself.

When Mephisto later appeared to claim Noble's soul, Mephisto's brother, the archangel Uriel, appeared and demanded that the soul of Noble Kale be spared. No agreement could be reached, and therefore a compromise was made whereby Noble's soul could not be claimed by either realm; but instead, his soul would remain in the void until re-bonded with certain members of his family.<ref>''Flashback - Ghost Rider'' #1 (July 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Noble Kale was also established as an ancestor of [[Jennifer Kale]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #82</ref>

===Ghost / The Rider===
Due to the Celestial Progenitor presence influencing human evolution, in 1,000,000 B.C., certain humans became much more intelligent than others as well as able to speak a new language. However, they had to hide that gift from their brethren for fear of being ostracized. One day, a boy that was gifted with the ability to speak is approached by a mysterious stranger that also possessed that gift, only to witness the stranger transform into a beast and devour his entire tribe. The stranger allowed the boy to live and names him "Ghost" before telling him to challenge him when he is worthy. The boy was forced to survive on his own, though he does befriend a woolly mammoth. After almost dying in the harsh environment, he is approached by Mephisto in the form of a snake, who tells him to say its name. Ghost does that and is bonded with a Spirit of Vengeance; after which he imbued his newly acquired hellfire into the mammoth. Other humans had never seen someone ride an animal before and began referring to Ghost as "the Rider". The Rider continued his search and five years later, eventually caught up with the man who devoured his tribe. The man transformed once more, revealing himself to be the first [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]. During the fight, the Rider took the bones of the dead that the Wendigo had killed and used them to form a weapon; the earliest version of the Ghost Rider's signature chain. The Rider fought the Wendigo until finally it and the Rider's woolly mammoth tumbled over a cliff. Afterwards, Ghost was approached by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and [[Phoenix Force (comics)#Lady Phoenix|Lady Phoenix]] to join the prehistoric version of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Upon imbuing his hellfire into another woolly mammoth, the Ghost Rider assisted the prehistoric Avengers (consisting of Agamotto, Odin, Lady Phoenix, and prehistoric versions of the [[Black Panther (character)#Black Panther 1,000,000 B.C.|Black Panther]], [[Iron Fist (comics)#Fan Fei|Iron Fist]], and [[Star Brand#Vnn|Star Brand]]) in fighting an out of control Celestial called the Fallen; which resulted in his woolly mammoth getting killed in action. The Ghost Rider swore revenge and assisted his teammates in defeating the Fallen and sealing it away underground in what would become South Africa.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The Ghost Rider later assisted the prehistoric Avengers in fighting the First Host.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Hellhawk===
During the 11th century, a Native American chieftain from the [[Sioux]] nation named Hellhawk sported the powers of the Ghost Rider. He was part of Thor's [[Avengers (comics)#Avengers (1,000 A.D.)|Avengers of 1,000 A.D]].<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''King Thor'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 17th century, Hellhawk developed a rivalry with Noble Kane.<ref name="Ghost Rider #33">''Ghost Rider'' vol. 6 #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was later killed by Narcosis to serve as a warning to Mephisto by Belasco to keep his Spirits of Vengeance out of Limbo.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 9 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The last stand of the Spirits of Vengeance===
Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat. Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, for which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens.

===Travis Parham===
A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears'' #1–6 (April–Sept. 2007) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]]. Set during the [[American Civil War]], it finds Confederate officer '''Travis Parham''' avenging the murders of his friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb's family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

===19th century Ghost Rider===
During the 19th century, an unnamed Ghost Rider was active during the [[American frontier]]. He targeted anyone who killed Native American women and children or who cut off their scalps.<ref name="Ghost Rider #33" />

===Deputy Kowalski===
'''Deputy Kowalski''' was a normal cop in a small town until Ghost Rider rode in one day. It was then that Kowalski was kidnapped by a local cannibal who cut off his hand. Events transpired that led to Kowalski escaping and developing a wrath against the Ghost Rider. His attention was brought to the hellfire shotgun in possession of Badilino. After purchasing the gun—and discovering to Badilino's surprise that it will work for Kowalski—Kowalski was recruited by agents of [[Zadkiel]] and told to wait in the middle of the desert for the Ghost Rider. Johnny Blaze (as Ghost Rider) did arrive in hot pursuit of Danny Ketch (as a new incarnation of Ghost Rider). Kowalski did manage to get a shot in on Blaze. Although it was a minor setback Blaze resumed his pursuit of Ketch. Left in the desert Kowalski soon found himself transformed into the new Vengeance, sporting green flames and a hook for his right hand, after Ketch returned the powers of the Spirits of Vengeance to Earth.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

With a thirst for revenge, Kowalski, as Vengeance, was recruited by [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] as a member of Zadkiel's Ghost Rider Assassination League.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire'' #1</ref> Kowalski was partnered with [[Orb (comics)|The Orb]] and was to stop Blaze and Ketch from reaching a monastery which contained a gateway to [[Heaven]]. Kowalski was easily defeated by both Ghost Riders and was left as a pet with the monastery's Mother Superior.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vengeance was later freed by the [[Shadow Council]] and joins their incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #21.1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

One day while on a cross-country trip across the United States, twenty-something couple [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and [[Roxanne Simpson]] come across a bar where they befriend a biker gang, who plies them with beer. The gang's friendly demeanor is a ruse, as they kill the intoxicated Blaze as part of a Satanic ritual. During the ritual, they barter their souls with Satan in exchange for wealth and power. Satan grants their request but maintains the upper hand. The deceased Blaze also makes a deal that [[Mephisto (comics)|Satan]] will get his soul in exchange for the assured safety of Roxanne. For twenty years Blaze trains to become the Ghost Rider, burning away his Christian baptism, and is sent into the world to get his revenge.

After pleading his case, Blaze is allowed to leave. He is later seen in a park with Satan watching Roxanne, who was brought back to life with no memory of what happened. Satan agrees to let her live her life if Blaze continues to be his Ghost Rider, to which Blaze agrees.<ref>Millar, Mark (w), Yu, Lenil Francis (a). ''Ultimate Comics Avengers 2'' #6 (Sept. 2010).
