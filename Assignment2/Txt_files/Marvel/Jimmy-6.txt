'''Giachomo "Jimmy-6" Fortunato''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is featured in the [[Marvel Universe]] and is commonly associated with [[Spider-Man]]. He first appeared in the comic, ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #70 and was created by writer Howard Mackie and artist John Romita Jr.

==Fictional character biography==
When the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] (Wilson Fisk) lost control of New York's underworld, crime lord [[Don Fortunato]] filled the power void. His son, Giachomo "Jimmy-6" Fortunato, disapproved of his family's methods and tried to quit organized crime just as his father's plans were coming to fruition. Enraged, Don Fortunato demands his son's death. On the run, Jimmy-6 pushes [[Ben Reilly]] (a clone of Peter Parker) away from a barrage of bullets intended for him. As [[Spider-Man]], Reilly returns the favor later by rescuing Jimmy-6 from an assassination attempt. Although the wounded Jimmy-6 wants nothing to do with Spider-Man, he reluctantly accepted Reilly's offer to hide out at his apartment.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #70-71</ref>

Hoping that Jimmy-6 could still be persuaded to return, Don Fortunato orders that he be captured rather than killed. Shortly after meeting Reilly's "cousin" Peter Parker, Jimmy-6 learns of an alliance of rival crime lords formed by gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] which plans to assassinate Don Fortunato. Jimmy went to warn his father of the planned hit, only to learn that Don Fortunato has formed an alliance with the [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] terrorist organization to defeat his rivals.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #73</ref>

In a small ceremony, Fortunato reveals he has kidnapped civilians from each of the territories of the attending crime lords. Jimmy-6 learns the civilians are to be executed as an example of what would happen in case of disobedience. Horrified, Jimmy pulls a gun on his own father. The attendees wait and see what happens. Don Fortunato disowns Jimmy right there on stage. Spider-Man - then Ben Reilly - and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] help rescue the civilians but need help themselves when they are cornered near an exit. Jimmy-6 flies in on an attack helicopter, killing the men threatening the group and carrying the heroes and civilians away to safety.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #74</ref>

Later, Jimmy-6 learns the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn) has killed Ben Reilly, and vows to avenge his friend's death.<ref>Extra pages of ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #75</ref>

Wounded by enemies of his father in Forest Hills, Queens, Jimmy-6 seeks refuge at the nearby Parker residence, where he stops an assassin sent by the Green Goblin.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #86-87</ref> He then departs. When Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was suspected of murdering street thug Joey Z, Jimmy-6, feeling he owes Spider-Man his life, saves him from vigilantes trying to collect the $5 million bounty placed on Spider-Man's head.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #89</ref> Soon after, Jimmy-6 shot a new Green Goblin (a genetic creation employed by Osborn), although the Goblin's armor saved him. Several vigilantes sought the bounty on Jimmy's head afterward, but the [[Punisher]] (Frank Castle) and government mercenary [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Shotgun|Shotgun]] (J.R. Walker) save him.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #255</ref>

When the Kingpin returns to claim his criminal empire, Jimmy-6 challenges him and rejoins the Fortunato crime cartel, replacing his incapacitated father (allegedly hospitalized by Kingpin). Trying to stop the bloodshed, Jimmy-6 reaches an agreement with the Kingpin. Peter Parker is caught photographing a secret meeting between Jimmy and the Kingpin, but Jimmy lets Parker go due to his "relationship" to Ben Reilly.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8</ref> After one of Jimmy's men accidentally knocks over the Kingpin's high-stakes poker game, New York erupts in a gang war between rival underworld faction. When Jimmy and his family are caught in a crossfire involving Kingpin's [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] (Fancy Dan, Montana, & Ox), Spider-Man's intervention enables Jimmy to escape, and he later helps Jimmy defeat the Enforcers in Jimmy's penthouse.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #28</ref>

Jimmy-6's current status is unknown now that Don Fortunato has regained his health and control of the cartel, but it was confirmed that Jimmy-6 had somehow made peace with his father, as Fortunato briefly refers to him as "My Beautiful Giacomo,"<ref>''[[The Sensational Spider-Man vol. 2 #5-8)|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man]]'' #7</ref> showing no signs of ill will. With [[Venom (Angelo Fortunato)|Angelo]] dead after as short term as the second [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], Jimmy-6 is in all probability the sole heir to Fortunato's crime empire.

==Powers and abilities==
Composed almost entirely of muscle, Jimmy-6's massive frame grants him peak human strength and resists many penetration wounds. He is a skilled strategist and electrical engineer, having designed the Fortunato estate's security systems. A veteran of two tours of duty with the U.S. Army, he is an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, firearms user, and helicopter pilot.

==In other media==
In the first iteration of ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'', the show was narrated by the Geek Chorus, Spider-Man fans who were in the process of writing the most extreme and ultimate Spider-Man story ever. One of them claims the name Jimmy-6. The role was played by [[Gideon Glick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abouttheartists.com/characters/73067|title=Jimmy-6, character in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark|publisher=AboutTheArtists}}</ref>
