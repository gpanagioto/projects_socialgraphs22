And then I saw ''High School Musical 3'' again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo. <poem><i>As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.</i></poem>  He's already seen ''High School Musical 3'' over a hundred times. <poem><i>As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.</i></poem> Hey Bridon. They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in!  Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?  Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?
