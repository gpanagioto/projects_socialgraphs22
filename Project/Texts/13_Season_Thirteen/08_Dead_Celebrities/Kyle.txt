 Ike! Ike, what?! Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities. I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again. What? What?! Are you serious?! Dude, why the hell would you DO that?! NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?! What was what? Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of. It's all just in your head, Ike. I just... don't understand it. But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to ''make'' you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it? But of course it matters, because you should be ''concerned'' there's ''blood'' in your underwear.  Do you understand this? Purgatory? What's that? What? Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory. Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems. Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother. Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?! Come back here!  Hey! Heeey! Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory! What the hell are we going to do??  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, ''were you alarmed?'' So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway? Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear? And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more? What has Michael Jackson always tried to be? Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants?  Alright, Michael!  Aww crap! We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away! Aw dude, this is hopeless!  So what?! Yeah! Ike!  Ike, you're back! It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
