 Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's Candy Shop. Oh that's great! Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub. You know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket.  Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners? Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called "The Ticking Clock." Works great in the movies.  
How can I help you? Yeah, you don't wanna run out of candy on Halloween. Sounds like you wanna be prepared.  Oh, I think you get an app on your phone and you can use them all over town. You don't like scooters?  Well, they seem pretty convenient.  Look, I got nothin' left, all right? Those are already accounted for by folks who called in! Those are for me! I've gotta protect my own house! There's nothin' left here. You've gotta go somewhere else!
