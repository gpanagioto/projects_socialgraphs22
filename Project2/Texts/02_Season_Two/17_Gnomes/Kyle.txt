Yeah. We don't ''wanna'' be in a group with Tweek.  No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas? Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up. We're his oral report buddies. Coffee? I don't think I like coffee. We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes. Come on, you guys! We better get to work! ''Man'', this stuff is strong.  Don't worry about it. Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up. Woohoo! Totally, dudes! I feel awesome! Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff? Killer!!  Gross, Cartman. Whoopee! Hogh, my stomach hurts.  Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek. Sure.   Thanks, dude. Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!  "And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America... And that's our report, I guess. I think it went really good. Those people really got into it. Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee? Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous. My butt hurts. Uh... ''[screen right to screen left] I don't like big corporations.'' Oh, God, when is this gonna end? So what are we gonna say? Does anybody know anything about corporations?  Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?<br>  Sshh, don't scare him. Cartman! Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?! Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid. Show us. Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass. Sooo, what's phase 2? Do you guys know anything about corporations? You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers. What? Big corporations are good! Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup. Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time.
