 Hello? Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like.  
Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter? Tolkien!  Tolkien? Did the boys come over and... show you a movie?  
I don't even know what to do now. 
Who's together? 
Tolkien? 
Look, I'm sorry if you don't want to talk about it, but have you thought of what you guys might do if Randy gets put away? 
Are you crazy? How are we gonna get that much weed together in time? I just hope you're not overdoin' it again. My God! I never thought we'd sell this much weed! Babe! That's how you got so much weed?!
