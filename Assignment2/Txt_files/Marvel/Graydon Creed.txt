==Fictional character biography==
Posing as German spy Leni Zauber, [[Mystique (character)|Mystique]] seduced freelance assassin [[Sabretooth (character)|Victor Creed]] (Sabretooth) while he was in Germany on a mission. Mystique later gave birth to a normal human child—Graydon—whom she gave up for adoption, although she kept an eye on him. When Graydon learned that he was the son of two mutants who had abandoned him as an inconvenience, he grew resentful of all mutants and that resentment coloured his outlook for the rest of his life.<ref>''Sabretooth'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In his adult years, Graydon formed a group called the [[Friends of Humanity]], dedicated to opposing mutant civil rights by committing acts of [[terrorism]] against peaceful mutants and mutant sympathizers, and using the acts of violent mutants such as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] to rally support for their cause.

===Upstarts===
Creed also came to join the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a group of wealthy and powerful individuals who had been brought together by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] and the enigmatic [[telepath]]ic [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]] with the sole purpose of killing mutants for points in a twisted game. After learning of his parents' identities, Creed sought to kill them as part of the Upstarts' game. Disguised as the armored '''Tribune''', Creed hired assassins to kill his mother and had his father implanted with a bomb. [[Sabretooth (comics)|His father]] managed to remove the device and confronted his son, who callously stabbed Sabretooth's assistant, Birdy, a mutant telepath whom Sabretooth employed to keep his homicidal rages in check.

During the Upstarts' self-professed "Younghunt", Creed was blackmailed into revealing the location of the Upstarts' prisoners by the New Warriors, who threatened to expose Creed as a mutant collaborator and the son of mutants.<ref>''New Warriors'' #45 (March 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Death===
Later, using the resources he had gained through the Friends of Humanity, and with the support of the government-sponsored anti-mutant taskforce, ''Operation: Zero Tolerance'', Creed nominated himself as a presidential candidate and ran on an anti-mutant platform.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #323, #334.</ref><ref>''X-Men'' (1991) #45, 51.</ref> Capitalizing on a near-hysterical fear of mutants in the general public (specially after the ''[[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]]'' debacle),<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #337.</ref> Creed's popularity swelled, which led to the Daily Bugle newspaper launching an investigation into Creed's activities, on-principle.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #337, ''X-Men'' (1991) #57.</ref> When a reporter from the Bugle obtained information regarding Creed's parentage, Zero Tolerance's leader, [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], killed the journalist to prevent the news from leaking out.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #339.</ref> Although they stopped the reporter, Creed did not manage to catch that the X-Men had also infiltrated his presidential campaign, by planting [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Bobby Drake]] (under the alias of "Drake Roberts") and [[Cannonball (Marvel Comics)|Sam Guthrie]] (under the alias of "Samson Guthry") as Creed's assistants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #338, #340.</ref><ref>''X-Men'' #58, 59.</ref>

After Lady Deathstrike and Daken are stabbed by a zombie version of [[Lord Dark Wind]], Sabretooth fights his zombified son who states that there is 10 minutes left before Maybelle is burned to the ground.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer'' #3.

Graydon Creed goes by the name 'Horror Show' in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality. He's a part of the X-Terminated team with a handful of other humans.

===House of M===
After Magneto's takeover of [[Genosha]], Graydon Creed rose to prominence as an anti-mutant activist, becoming friends with vice-president [[Bolivar Trask]]. His prominence was short-lived as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] (who compared Graydon Creed to [[Adolf Hitler]]) viewed it as his duty to rid the world of the man. Magneto sent his assassin Sabretooth to kill him. Graydon Creed's massacred body was found by government agents, and Trask ordered his death ruled an accident to prevent panic.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #3 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
*Graydon Creed appeared in the [[X-Men: The Animated Series|''X-Men'']] animated series voiced by [[John Stocker (voice actor)|John Stocker]]. As in the comics, Creed hates mutants because he is ashamed of being part mutant himself and because his parents, Mystique and Sabretooth, were abusive to him. Many years later, Graydon founded the Friends of Humanity (FOH), an anti-mutant [[hate group]] that sought to vilify mutants. After the Beast's pardon by the President, Graydon's resentment grew even more and the Friends of Humanity began targeting the X-Men. In the episode "Time Fugitives", he hires a scientist to create a virus that would wipe out the mutant race, but would be relatively harmless to ordinary humans. While giving a speech about the plague's effects, Graydon attempts to infect Beast with the virus but is stopped by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. During the struggle, Graydon accidentally infects himself and retreats back to the lab for medical aid. The X-Men follow him, attack the base and the scientist reveals himself to be [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. The X-Men help him get clear of the battle. The X-Men destroy the virus and Graydon returns to the Friends of Humanity headquarters. In the episode "Beauty and the Beast", Beast begins dating a former patient, named Carly. The FOH protest outside the clinic, and later kidnap Carly. Beast begins searching for her and Wolverine, in an unusual act of patience, infiltrates the Friends of Humanity, pretending to be the victim of an assault by evil mutants. Graydon gladly accepts him into the fold. As they get to know each other, Wolverine begins to suspect that Graydon Creed is Sabretooth's son. An enraged Beast attacks the FOH headquarters and the X-Men use a holographic projector to display information on Sabretooth in front of the Friends of Humanity, including his real name (given in this episode as Graydon Creed Senior). Ruined, Graydon suffers a nervous breakdown as his followers abandon him. Creed spends months in a psychiatric hospital. Once he recovers, Graydon tries to return to the folds of the ''Friends of Humanity'' organization in the episode "Bloodlines". A council of masked men now rule over ''Friends of Humanity''. However, after having been made aware of his having a mutant for a father, have been digging further into his past and uncovered that his family tree "bears much mutant/rotten fruit"; they declare that in order to lead the ''Friends of Humanity'' once more, he has to prove himself by killing Mystique (his birth mother) and Nightcrawler (his younger half-brother). Creed then kidnaps Mystique and sends Nightcrawler a letter, telling him that he must come to the Friends of Humanity base or they will kill his mother. Nightcrawler seeks the help of Rogue and Wolverine. They locate the base and walk straight into a trap. Graydon captures and tries to kill all of them, but the mutants break free and destroy the base with Creed's helicopter being washed away. Creed is recovered by four of the council members and bound. They state that he has failed for the last time and callously delivered via [[parachute]] to Sabretooth's cabin in the woods, who presumably tortures him.

* The character Duncan Matthews voiced by [[Vincent Gale]] in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' greatly resembles Graydon Creed. A school jock who dated [[Jean Grey]]. After the secret about mutants was revealed, he became more antagonistic, turning to hate crimes and assaulting mutants. His hatred for mutants grew to the point that he attempted to kill Evan Daniels AKA Spyke (Storm's Nephew in the series).
