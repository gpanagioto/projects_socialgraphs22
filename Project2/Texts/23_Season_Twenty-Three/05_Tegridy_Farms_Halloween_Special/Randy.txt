 Well? You all excited, gang? Ugh, this isn't any Halloween, because this week, Tegridy Weed is doing a Halloween special. It's big promotional thing. Everyone's gonna love it. Hey, wuh-where's Shelly? Why?  Hey, Shelly? Can I talk to you for a minute? Come on, kiddo.  Shelly, we need to talk about your marijuana problem. You know, what's your problem with it? Yes, we all know, but ugh, why? Shelly, the truth is, some of the most important people in the world smoke weed. Did you know that Snoop Dogg smokes weed? Ugh, way more people enjoy marijuana than you think, okay? Okay, who's your idol? Who do you most look up to in the whole world? Total stoner. High as a kite. Every tennis match. You don't know that, Shelly! Now you're just making assumptions!  Whoa! Whoa! Wait just one second! Are you actually saying that hemp, a classification of cannabis  Hold the freaking phone! You're telling us that marijuana has been used throughout the centuries-? No, I d-, I'm just, I'm surprised that- And, and it is, Shelly. We're havin' a great time!  It's just so hard being a parent sometimes, you know? I've tried everything to get through to my daughter. I took her to a laser show, I played her all of Dark Side Of The Moon, but... it's like... it's like there's something in her head that just doesn't get it! It's just- I have to live my life, you know? I can't let her problems with marijuana drag me down anymore. So, anyway, hey. How's the Halloween Special comin' along? It's ready? O-ho wow! The Halloween Special! I'm so excited to try it.  Oh, wow, that is nice! I'd like to see anyone compete with this Halloween Special. Oh, man, I really like it. It's really smooth. This is so good that we shold stop smoking it right now. We don't want to ruin our Halloween experience, you know?  AAAAAAA! Shelly! No! Nooo!! I just need some time, okay, Towelie? Alright, Towelie, what is this ab-? Whoa!  The Halloween Special!  Yeah! We're back! Yeah! Yeah! Okay, that should be enough Halloween Special for the first few people . What what?   You're going to a book fair? On fucking Halloweed?  You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?! I will not! I have things to get ready, and nobody cares about books on Halloween, Shelly! OH MY GOD!   It's a nightmare! It's a personal hell! I've done everything I can, as a father, to help he with her problem, but she just ignores everything I say! I can't do this! Oh, Shelly, I love you! Her mother doesn't say anything anymore! Whenever I bring up our daughter's marijuana problem, my wife says "I'm gonna lose my mind if you bring this up again." It's destroying all of us! I just think, maybe a night in jail is the wakeup call that she needs. I'm barely gonna have fun at the Halloween Special now! It's gonna be really hard for me to rage knowing you're in here, Shelly. It's gonna be really hard for me to rage!  Hey, come on in, guys! There's candy and hot dogs! Samplers of the special are there on the table, guys. Feel free to light up! Okay, I'll hold down the fort.  Naw, you see, fluvial geomorphology deals with the way rivers change over time. It's geology shit. It's why I got out of it, really. Oh! That's a company secret, my friend! Hey, are you alright there, buddy?  Towelie! There's something wrong with thte special! Oh Jesus! What happened?!    Ooooohh! Winnie the Pooh! Winnie the Pooh! There's monsters everywhere! It's some kind of curse! Unspeakable evil! All different kindds of monsters! Zombies and plant people and bears! Oh my God! What's that?! Oh my God, it's Harvey Weinstein! He's got me! You've got to-argh! He's inside me! Harvey Weinstein is inside me! You've gotta send help! People are dying everywhere! No! Harvey, I said no! Please, somebody co-  Oh God, it's the cows we killed! Get 'im off of me! Get 'im off of me! Oh my God! Get 'im off of me!  Waugh! Get 'im off of me! Get 'im off of me! Augh! We gotta fight them, Towelie! Waugh! We're going to live! We're going to live!  Hey, guess I slept in late, huh? What time is it?  Ooof, wow. That was some strong-ass Halloween Special, y'all. I mean... I saw rapists in the hot tub, zombie cows. I thought I was gonna die, and then, this fat, bitchy angel came and put me to bed.  Did everyone enjoy the Halloween Special? Oh. Well, that was pretty much my target audience anyway.
