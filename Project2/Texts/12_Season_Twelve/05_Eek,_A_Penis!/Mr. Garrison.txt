Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man. Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!
