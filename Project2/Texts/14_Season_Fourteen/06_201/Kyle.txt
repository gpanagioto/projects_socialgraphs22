Aw crap. Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.  Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it! Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig? I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on!  Come on, Muhammad, the door is open. Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand. Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications! Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now! Oh, you are not doing ''that'' again! Stop talking with your stupid hand! Dude! We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist! Oh, yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back. That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only ''true'' power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works. Look, man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear. Wwait, what? Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?! You gotta be kidding me! Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
