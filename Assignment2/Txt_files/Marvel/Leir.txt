'''Leir''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is one of the Celtic gods of [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)#The island of Avalon and the Celtic Gods|Avalon]], god of lightning and the spear.  For ages, enmity existed between the gods of Avalon and the gods of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Leir is based on [[Lir]] in [[Celtic mythology]].

==Fictional character biography==
Leir dwelt in the realm of Avalon with the other Celtic gods.

When the [[Heliopolitans (comics)|Heliopolitan]] god [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]] sought to make war against the other gods, he dispatched foul beasts to both Avalon and Asgard. When [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] pursued one of these beasts, the griffin-like beast traveled through a dimensional rift to Avalon, and Thor followed. When the Celtic gods saw Thor, they blamed him for the beasts, and Leir battled Thor through the misunderstanding. [[Hogun]] the Grim had followed Thor to offer his support, and when one of the beasts appeared, the gods knew that none of them were responsible for the beasts. The three gods battled the beast and drove it off.<ref>''Thor'' #386</ref> Leir felt that he owed Thor a debt for helping against the winged monster, and sent a force of Celtic gods, including [[Caber (comics)|Caber]], to battle the armies of Seth when he attacked [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' #398-400; ''The West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #41</ref>

Leir and Caber next attacked the camp of the Fomorians, the traditional enemies of Avalon.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #30</ref> Leir and Caber later entered Asgard again through a dimensional portal. Leir attempted to claim [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] as his bride, but she said he must help rescue Thor, and battle her champion.<ref>''Thor'' #417</ref> Leir and Caber clashed with [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] in Asgard, and then accompanied Sif to Earth in search of Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #418</ref> Leir, Caber, and Sif then traveled to the [[Black Galaxy]] and found [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] there. The gods then traveled to Asgard, with [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Leir, Caber, and Hercules then battled [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]], and witnessed Asgard's victory over Ymir and [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #425</ref> Leir then challenged Thor to a duel over Sif, believing him to be her champion, but was instead defeated in a duel with Sif.<ref>''Thor'' #426</ref>
