Hiya, Sparky. That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop. Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy? He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain. He's not meaner than Sparky. Sparky'll kick his ass. That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! Sparky! Bad dog! What?! What do you mean? He's just confused. Sick, shut up dude! Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Huh? Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he ''is'' smart. Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down! Get down, Sparky! Down! Um, I'm not really prepared either. Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it- Wow, cool! Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question? What's a... homosexual? I guess. Shut up, dude! Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf? He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky. Good boy, now shake. Good boy. Now, don't be gay. Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay. I don't know. Come on you guys, I have an idea. Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't- Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?! No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. Atta boy, Spark! Get her! Yes! Ah crap! Now what do I do? I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil. Like who? Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual. Damn it! I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews. Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares? No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog! I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay. I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice. Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back. I think he might've run away. I'm not playing. I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog.  Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be? Sparky! Sparky! Fine, how are you? My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here. Do you have lots of gay dogs here? Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy. Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'? I missed you old pal, you really had me scared. Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game. We can work on making you not gay together. Sparky? What don't I understand? This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand. Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al! No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! I will Big Gay Al, I will. I've been getting my best friend back. Hike! Mph! Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys. And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year! And it's okay to be gay! Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing. I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety. It's true, I'll show you. But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club... Oh, there you are dude. How's it going? Wow!
