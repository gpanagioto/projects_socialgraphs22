==Fictional character biography==
Jinx is an Indian elemental [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] whose powers include the ability to command elements such as air, the manipulation of magical energy that she can manifest as offensive force bolts and green flame, the ability to dissolve matter, and creation of ground tremors. Jinx is bald and slender. She traditionally wears only a white two-piece [[loincloth]] [[bikini]] with golden [[jewelry]], and she is always barefoot due to the fact that she must be in contact with the ground to use her nature element abilities.{{issue|date=August 2018}}

She first encountered the Fearsome Five when that group attacked Tri-State prison where she was incarcerated at the request of Indian authorities. The Five are defeated by the Teen Titans, but Jinx and Neutron decided to join the Fearsome Five. Jinx remained with the group even after Neutron subsequently left it, but after their next appearance in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #430 (July 1987), in which they fought Superman alongside new members Deuce and Charger, the group disbanded, and Jinx was incarcerated in the [[metahuman]] prison on [[Alcatraz]], along with her teammates [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] and [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]].

Jinx was part of [[Circe (comics)|Circe's]] army of female supervillains that was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and Earth's other superheroines.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #174-175. DC Comics.</ref> Shortly thereafter, Jinx was recruited by [[Queen Clea]] into the re-formed all-female crime organization Villainy Inc. Together with Cyborgirl, [[Doctor Poison]], [[Giganta]], and [[Trinity (comics character)|Trinity]], Jinx assists Clea in conquering the other-dimensional land of [[Skartaris]]. The plan, however, is commandeered by Trinity. The team has not appeared since.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #179-183. 2. DC Comics.</ref>

Later, in a storyline in ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #12–15 (July–October 2004), frequent [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] archenemy [[Dr. Sivana]] freed Jinx, Mammoth and Gizmo from Alcatraz. Having summoned teammate [[Psimon]] and having brought her teammate [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]] back to life after she had been turned into glass and shattered, Sivana put the team to work for him in a scheme to [[short selling|short sell]] [[Lexcorp]] stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building. Sivana also had them destroy two other Lexcorp properties. At the latter of the two, a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] processor factory of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the Outsiders. After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's nuclear missile facility near [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]], [[California]]. When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again. The Five decided to enact their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at Canada, but were defeated by the Outsiders. Mammoth was returned to Alcatraz Island, but Jinx and the other members of the Five remain at large.{{issue|date=August 2018}}

She was later seen among the new [[Injustice League]], and is one of the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. She is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].{{issue|date=August 2018}}

As part of DC Comics' 2011 reboot of its continuity, [[The New 52]], Jinx is a member of the [[Fearsome Five]], which is part of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], and allies with [[Crime Syndicate of America|The Crime Syndicate]].<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #29. DC Comics.</ref> She is sent with the other members of the Fearsome Five, Mammoth, Gizmo, Shimmer and Psimon, along with [[Doctor Psycho|Dr Psycho]] and [[Hector Hammond]] to fight against [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and the [[Metal Men]]. She ends up defeated by Lead.{{fact|date=February 2022}}

In DC's 2016 relaunch of its titles, [[DC Rebirth]], Jinx appears as a member of the Fearsome Five.<ref>[[Abnett, Dan]] (w), [[Booth, Brett]] (p), [[Rapmund, Norm]] (i). "Made in Manhattan Part Two: Buzz Kill", ''Titans'' (vol. 2) #9 (May 2017). DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jinx is a formidable elemental sorceress who draws her magic from the solid, natural ground. This is why she must have contact between the ground and her bare feet at all times, or else her magical effects become weakened or lost altogether. Her elemental abilities include, but are not limited to: generating powerful force blasts, conjuring wind bursts, summoning emerald flames, creating earth tremors, creating illusions, and even dissolving solid matter. Jinx also has precognitive abilities that allow her to sense dangerous events moments before they occur. Jinx has an ability to converse with the Earth itself, in order to gently manipulate even greater magic stored there. She may have other mystical abilities as well, although none are certain.{{fact|date=May 2022}}

==Other versions==
The animated version of Jinx makes numerous appearances in the comic spin-off of the ''Teen Titans'' animated television series, beginning in issue #1. In #26–27, hints are given of Jinx later reforming her criminals ways (much as in the episode "Lightspeed"). In issue #34 she is depicted as [[Kid Flash]]'s girlfriend. In issue #40, she is still a member of the Hive Five, and issue #43, she aids the Titans in confronting the Fearsome Five. In #53, Jinx' nickname is "Lucky".
