 Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual. It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz? Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll. You're looking ultra-fabulous.  Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that. Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight. Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about? What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about. Oh really?! Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare. Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!  Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you! Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets! Oh my God, it's on fire!  I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants! Put it out! Put it out! Fire! Hey eses.
