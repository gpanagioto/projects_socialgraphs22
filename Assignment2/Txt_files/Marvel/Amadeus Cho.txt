==Fictional character biography==
{{long plot|date=January 2020}}
Amadeus Cho is a Korean American named after his parents' love for [[Mozart]]'s music and [[Methodist]] beliefs. His story begins when he wins the Excello Soap Company's "Brain Soap" competition, making him the seventh-smartest person in the world. Pythagoras Dupree, the game's creator and the world's sixth smartest man, tries to kill Cho to preserve his ranking. In a botched attempt, Cho's parents are killed, but he survives and goes on the run with a [[Vespa]] scooter and a [[coyote]] pup. When the [[Hulk]] later saves him from some of Dupree's men, Cho considers the Hulk a friend and a hero worthy of respect.

Cho is next seen during the events of the crossover event, [[World War Hulk]], where he first comes across a de-powered [[She-Hulk|Jen Walters]].<ref name="ReferenceA">''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #106</ref> He then gathers Hulk's former colleagues, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], both of whom considered themselves in debt to the Hulk for mistakenly attacking him on a previous occasion. With the assistance of [[Namora]] they attempt and fail to stop the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #107</ref>

===''The Incredible Hercules''===
The ''Incredible Hulk'' series is then retitled ''Incredible Hercules'' from #112 on, and Cho becomes Hercules' sidekick. While on the run with Hercules, Cho participates in a number of adventures, including helping Hercules and other Earthly gods defeat the pantheon of [[Skrull]] gods during the [[Secret Invasion]] storyline. It is revealed that Cho's greatest fear is finding out that all the bad events in his life are his fault.

Following this storyline the pair battle [[Amazons]]. Amadeus is attracted to the Amazon warrior [[Delphyne Gorgon]], but upon her becoming queen she is obliged to end any flirtation, to his sadness.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #121-125</ref>

Together with Athena, Amadeus and Hercules next confront the new head of the Olympians, [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]],<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #127-128</ref> and travel to the Underworld to rescue [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] from Hades. There it is revealed that Cho's sister is still alive and missing. Upon learning this, he tearfully leaves Hercules, determined to find out what happened to his sister.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #129-131</ref>

Venturing to the town of Excello, Utah, he encounters former FBI Agent Sexton, who had contacted him shortly after the death of his parents, and battles Dupree. Cho realizes the potential of his brain to serve as a 'hypercomputer', and figures out that Sexton is in fact Athena in disguise.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #133, 135</ref>

Amadeus finally confronts Dupree in person, and learns that Dupree was not aware of Amadeus' sister being missing. Amadeus also learns that his destiny is to be the new hero of the modern era of reason and to stop the "primordial darkness." Dupree then challenges Amadeus to a specialized version of Russian roulette, which Amadeus refuses to do, leaving Dupree to simply shoot himself. After grieving about the situation, he then discovers the truth about Hera's mysterious "Continuum" project.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #137</ref>

Parallel to those stories, in the aftermath of the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, the character is used by writer [[Dan Slott]] in his run on the ''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' series.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Mighty Avengers'' #21</ref>

Athena then reveals to Cho that he is her choice to be the next Prince of Power, the "hero of the mind" as opposed to Hercules' "hero of strength," thereby suggesting that Hercules will soon meet his death. Cho vows to prevent this, but ultimately appears to be unsuccessful.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #138</ref> After a fight to restore Athena to life after  [[Delphyne Gorgon|Delphyne]] uses a weapon to turn her to stone,<ref>''The Incredible Hercules''#139</ref> Athena destroys the Continuum, causing the universe Hercules is in to be destroyed.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #141</ref>

A funeral service is held at the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, where a tearful Amadeus demands Athena show herself and pay her respects.

But the combatants ultimately turn against the gods, and Phobos uses his power over fear to manipulate Hades into opening a portal to the Underworld. Amadeus travels into the land of the dead to look for Hercules and meets Persephone, wife of Hades. She tells him that Hades would not have allowed him in if Hercules' soul had been there. The following Monday Athena arrives at Olympus Group headquarters to find that Amadeus has accepted her offer and is now acting as CEO. He tells her that he is not her champion, he is Hercules' champion, and that he will be using all the powers given to him to find Hercules.<ref>''Hercules: Fall of an Avenger'' #2</ref>

Cho steals the list from Vali and goes to Asgard himself, only to find that Vali had already stolen the apples, framing him for the theft. Cho convinces Thor that he is innocent, and Thor then joins his quest to both stop Halfling and resurrect Hercules. With some additional assistance from Delphyne, who is now his girlfriend, Cho succeeds in thwarting Halfling and using the elixir to assume true godhood. However, he realizes that he is inadequate to wield this power permanently, and he instead transfers it to the returned Hercules, as Hercules warns that the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Chaos King]] is coming.<ref>''Heroic Age: Prince of Power'' #1-4</ref>

After the others agree to recruit him, Hulk is later seen kissing Viv in the forest. They later head to Lasibad, Sharzad to help a group of women and girls that are being gunned down by terrorists. After rescuing a small group, they form a plan to drive the oppressors away. After their victory, the team argues over who should be the leader when their ship gets hit by a bazooka. Upon surviving the crash, Hulk and Cyclops propel the vehicle forward because Viv saw land. Unfortunately, the 'land' they saw turned out to be an Atlantean ship and they were kidnapped. They manage to break free of their captors, escape the ship and fly away. But somewhere else, the Champions also inspired another well-known, but troublesome hero: [[Gwenpool]]. They later appear in a small town that is experiencing a wave of hate crimes. Gwenpool arrives to help them and they figure out that the town sheriff is responsible for the spread of the hate crimes.

The team then manages to defeat Psycho-Man and cure Cyclops.<ref>''[[Champions (comics)|Champions]]'' vol. 2 #10-12</ref>

===Dealing with his Hulk side===
Amadeus Cho exiles himself into space to find a way to contain his Hulk form's dangerous side. However, he was interrupted by a distress signal from the restored planet Sakaar which Hulk had once freed from the Red King. He finds that the many nomadic tribes of Sakaar are being threatened by the Warlord from Fillia. Amadeus Cho's Hulk form represented the Dokka'abi Clan in a series of survival trials.

However, the Hulk persona took over his body while Amadeus' normal side is trapped in his own mindscape.<ref>''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #709-713</ref>

During the "[[World War Hulk#World War Hulk II|World War Hulk II]]" story arc, the Dark Hulk side of Amadeus Cho's Hulk form defeats Phalkan when he attacks using a combination of his Hulk abilities and Amadeus Cho's intelligence. With Phalkan badly defeated, Amadeus Cho's Hulk form declares war on his enemies which is seen on the news.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #714</ref> This causes the Alpha Flight Space Program, the Champions, the Protectors, and Odinson to work together to defeat Amadeus Cho's Dark Hulk form. Maddy Cho discovers that the dark side of Amadeus Cho's Hulk form has trapped Amadeus Cho's mind in its body. Thanks to the injection of counterbots, the nanobots that were used to transform Amadeus Cho into Hulk in the first place start to lose their power. With Amadeus starting to overpower his Dark Hulk side and deciding to embrace his fate, the aftermath of it has left Amadeus with a Hulk form that more resembles a taller version of him. Amadeus quotes to Maddy "I'm not the Hulk anymore, I'm just..." before Captain Marvel interrupts by quoting "Cho", just as Cho turn himself in for the crime when Dark Hulk took over his body. Three months after spending in prison, Cho was informed by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] that the former is now relieved from the position of Olympus Group’s CEO, whereas Maddy and Hercules are able to handle the company’s respective administration holdings.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #715-717</ref> Since obtaining this new form, Amadeus Cho has called himself Brawn.<ref>''Champions'' vol. 2 #22</ref>

==="War of the Realms"===
In the 2019 "[[War of the Realms]]" storyline, Brawn and the Protectors take part in a demonstration for Jimmy Woo's Pan-Asian School for the Unusually Gifted in [[Mumbai]] where Amadeus is reprimanded by Kamala for his reckless behavior and disregard for teamwork. While Jimmy offers the Protectors membership to the [[Agents of Atlas]], the team is suddenly alerted by the news of [[War of the Realms|Malekith's invasion of Earth]]. Most of the New Agents of Atlas head to [[Seoul]] while Ms. Marvel joins Jake Oh and the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] in New York. The Agents find Seoul under attack Malekith's ally Queen Sindr and her Fire Goblin forces from [[Muspelheim]] with the Korean heroes [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]], [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent, Io]] and [[Luna Snow]] defending the city. Jimmy is knocked unconscious when their aircraft crash lands, forcing an unprepared Amadeus to take charge of the team. White Fox mistakes Brawn for the Hulk and attacks him along with Crescent and Io; Brawn accidentally freezes Luna with her own ice when he attempts to clear up the misunderstanding.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #1</ref>  Eventually two groups team up and begin fighting off the invaders. After Sindr threatens to summon a volcano in the middle of the city and kill millions of innocents, Amadeus uses Bruce Banner's technology to teleport Atlas and their new allies away from the battle, allowing Sindr to annex [[South Korea]] and imprison Luna. With the help of the team Amadeus disguises himself as a Fire Goblin and rescues Luna from her prison. Afterwards Amadeus teleports the Chinese heroes [[Lin Lie|Sword Master]] and [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]], [[Philippines|Filipina]] heroine [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]], and the [[Hawaii]]an Goddess of Fire and Volcanoes [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] from [[Shanghai]] to help assist in the fight against Sindr. The newly summoned heroes are initially furious with Amadeus for taking them out of their battle with Sindr's forces in Shanghai and attack him and the group, but Pele quickly puts a stop to the infighting, warning the group that Sindr plans to melt the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice caps]] if they don't work together.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #2</ref> Amadeus, Jimmy and White Fox contact Codec from [[Tokyo]]'s Future Avengers, [[Triumph Division#Red Feather|Red Feather]] of [[Manila]]'s [[Triumph Division]] and the Ascendant member [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]] in [[Beijing]] to form a battle plan. After formulating a plan, Brawn confronts Sindr and her forces directly while Aero, Wave and Luna use Sindr's black Bifrost to travel to the [[Arctic]] to decrease its temperature; the remaining members are teleported to Northern China where Shang-Chi begins training the remaining members for their final fight.  After a long fight, Amadeus is eventually overwhelmed and is taken prisoner by Sindr, who begins flying with her forces to Northern China.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #3</ref> It is later revealed that Brawn's capture was a ruse, as the remaining Agents arrive and take Sindr and her forces by surprise; Pele reveals herself to be M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced Atlas Android, who then absorbs Sindr's energy and self-destructs, weakening her.  With Shang-Chi's training the group defeats her, although at the cost of Monkey King sacrificing himself. Despite given the chance to surrender, Sindr flees, only for Amadeus and the others to follow her with Brawn's teleporter, where they help [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat her and her remaining forces at the [[Great Wall of China]] near [[Beijing]].  While the team recuperates in [[Shanghai]] after Malekith's defeat, Brawn confronts Jimmy for withholding the truth about Pele from the team as M-41 could've been used to defeat Sindr in Seoul earlier. Jimmy justifies his actions, saying that using the android earlier would've killed civilians and that he hid the truth to guarantee success, noting that "Pele" was able to lead the team when Amadeus couldn't. Amadeus then warns Jimmy of the ramifications for impersonating a god and tells him that the team can no longer trust him. After Amadeus leaves to check on his teammates, Jimmy quietly congratulates him and the rest of the group.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #4</ref>

===New Agents of Atlas===
Shortly after the "War of the Realms" storyline, Jimmy has resumed his duties as the head of the Atlas Foundation while Amadeus is appointed as the leader of the New Agents. Amadeus and a few members of the new agents are seen in [[Madripoor]] fighting one of Sindr's remaining Fire Dragons, where they encounter Isaac Ikeda, the self-proclaimed "Protector of Pan", who uses his technologically advanced weaponry to slay the dragon and teleports away with its corpse.  Afterwards, while Amadeus has a video chat with Jimmy from the Atlas bunker in Seoul, their conversation is interrupted by a white light engulfing the city, which Amadeus recognizes as Ikeda's teleportation technology. Amadeus, along with the reunited Agents and the newly summoned [[Giant-Man#Raz Malhotra|Giant-Man]] discover the cities they were in (along with other Asian, Pacific and [[Ethnic enclave|predominantly Asian cities outside of Asia]]) have been merged and connected together with portals made from Ikeda's technology.  Mike Nguyen of the Big Nguyen Company reveals himself to be behind the newly merged city, "Pan", which he states for 24 hours would allow every citizen to easily explore each other's respective cities without any political and economic restrictions. Despite the excitement of his teammates and the citizens, Amadeus is wary of Nguyen's proposal. Shortly after the announcement, Pan is suddenly beset by [[wyvern]]s, which the agents and Ikeda confront.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' vol. 3 #1</ref>

After driving the wyverns off, the group is praised by Nguyen for their heroics, who offers to enlist the agents as Pan's protectors along with Ikeda as well as giving them lifetime Pan Passes. A suspicious Amadeus rejects the offer, saying that the group are Agents are Atlas; when Giant-Man asks if this includes him as well, Amadeus informally invites him to the team.  During a celebratory banquet held in the [[Mumbai]] section of Pan, Amadeus confides with Cindy and Luna his suspicions of Nguyen and Ikeda. Amadeus and Luna later have a stroll along the beach, where they end up rescuing a raft Mandripoorian refugees from [[sea serpent]]s. Several armed members of the Pan Guard arrive and accuse the Madripoorians of using the serpents to illegally to enter Pan, which this leads to a confrontation between the guards and Brawn and Luna who help the refugees escape. After the fight, Amadeus and Luna share a kiss; it's then revealed that the rescue, the fight with the Pan Guard and the kiss is being broadcast by Nguyen to promote Pan Passes to spectators,<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' vol. 3 #2</ref> much to Amadeus' and Luna's embarrassment and anger. After the Atlas agents and Ikeda team up with the Pan Guard to save the refugees from the serpents, Nguyen clears up the misunderstanding, claiming that the Madripoorians had been out of range during Pan's activation and the Pan Guard mistakenly believed they were trespassing with help from the serpents; Nguyen has the refugees escorted to the Pan Grand Hotel as special guests. When Amadeus summons the team to the Atlas secret bunker in Seoul, they are unexpectedly joined by Ikeda. When Ikeda is interrogated by Amadeus the team about his and Nguyen's motives, Issac explains that he was hired by Nguyen due to his expertise in fighting dragons, but offers little about Nguyen. Isacc has his own suspicions of Mike and suggests that the Atlas agents to join him as Pan's protectors as it would be easier for them to gather information about the Big Nguyen Company on the inside. Amadeus reluctantly agrees to have the team continue helping Pan and to find out more about Nguyen; when the team goes their separate ways to different Pan sectors, Amadeus and Silk go to the Pan Grand Hotel to check on the Mandripoorian refugees. Unbeknownst to the agents, their actions are being monitored by Jimmy and Mr. Lao, the dragon adviser to the Atlas Foundation.<ref name="AoA 3-3">''Agents of Atlas'' vol. 3 #3</ref>  When Amadeus visits his old Champions teammates at their mobile base for movie night, they are interrupted a news report featuring Geoffrey Patrick, a [[United States Senate|senator]] from [[Indiana]], who cites Amadeus' actions during "World War Hulk II" to voice his opposition to teenage [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]].<ref>''Incoming!'' #1</ref>

Following another confrontation with the Pan Guard who were harassing some young beggars, Amadeus splits the team up again: Aero, Wave and Luna are sent to patrol the city for more dragons; Giant-Man is ordered to continue working with Ikeda to gather more intel on him, much to Raz's chagrin due to his growing attraction to Issac; while tasking Shang-Chi with finding the still missing Jimmy, Amadeus confides in the Master of Kung Fu his own struggles with leadership and his suspicions of Jimmy. During their investigation, Brawn, Silk and White Fox discover that the central heart of Pan doesn't correspond with any known location on Earth, which causes Amadeus to deduce that the city is in a separate dimension. Amadeus becomes more suspicious when one of the Madripoorian refugees tells him about hearing dragons roaring from Nguyen's personal tower.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' vol. 3 #4</ref> Discovering a photograph of Jimmy and Nguyen together in Jimmy's office in the Mumbai sector of Pan, Shang-Chi relays this to the group and uncovers a laptop that broadcasts the sound of a dragon's roar from Nguyen's tower in the Heart of Pan. Brawn, Silk, Sword Master and White Fox break into Nguyen's tower and discover a sea serpent imprisoned in a lab, while Shang-Chi and Crescent discover a secret tunnel in Jimmy's office that takes them to the Atlas Foundation's headquarters in the Pan sector of [[San Francisco]], where they come face to face with Jimmy and Mr. Lao, who introduces himself to the Atlas agents. Nguyen denies that he and Jimmy are in league with each other, other than signing nonaggression treaty between Atlas and Pan, which the agents just violated. Nguyen explains that since dragon scales contain magical properties associated with portals and teleportation, the imprisoned dragon was having its scales harvested to supply Pan's portal and teleportation technology. Suspecting the serpent's identity, Lao and Jimmy order to agents to free her lest awakening the wrath every dragon on the planet, while Nguyen and Ikeda argue that releasing the dragon will cause the portals to collapse, displacing every citizen and refugee that had settled in the portal-city. Rejecting both Jimmy and Nguyen's arguments, Amadeus attempts to come up with an alternate solution that could save the dragon without disrupting the Pan portals. When Lao warns Amadeus that he is running out of time, a massive storm begins engulfing the city. While Ikeda reveals that the imprisoned dragon, which he captured a year ago for terrorizing the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], is from [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Regions and countries|Atlantis]], an enraged [[Namor]] emerges from the waters off of Pan's coast and [[Atlantis Attacks#Atlantis Attacks (2020)|begins invading the city]]<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' vol. 3 #5</ref>

==="Atlantis Attacks"===
In the 2020 "[[Atlantis Attacks]]" storyline, Brawn confronts Namor, who had summoned tidal waves along the coasts of the [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]] and [[Manila]] sectors of Pan. When Namor demands the release of the dragon, Brawn asks for some more time, arguing that immediately releasing the dragon would cause Pan's portals to collapse, putting its citizens' lives at risk.  Unmoved, Namor continues his assault, only to stop when the New Agents of Atlas arrive to back Brawn up. Before retreating, Namor warns the group to return the dragon or face the wrath of Atlantis. Immediately after the skirmish, Jimmy introduces Amadeus and the New Agents to the original Agents of Atlas.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' #1</ref>  Wary of [[Namora]]'s familial relationship with Namor, Brawn discretely orders Shang-Chi and Sword Master to spy on her while she, [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]], Aero and Wave are sent by Jimmy on a diplomatic mission to Atlantis. With help from [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Uranian]] and [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]], Amadeus is able to successfully replicate the dragon's magic with [[M-11 (comics)|M-11]]'s generator, allowing the dragon to be safely released from captivity while keeping Pan's portals stabilized.  However upon her arrival, the dragon suddenly goes berserk and beings attacking the underwater kingdom. After Atlantis' scientists discover the source of the dragon's behavior to be an implant embedded in its scales, Namor accuses Brawn to be behind the deception and immediately flies to Pan for revenge, where he viciously assaults Brawn and attacks Nguyen's tower.  After the Pan Guard and Brawn are able to push Namor's assault back to the ocean, Nguyen reveals that he has recruited the [[Sirena (Philippine mythology)|Sirenas]], the longtime enemies of Atlantis, to help defend Pan.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' #2</ref>

During his fight with Namor, Amadeus mutates back into his original Hulk form after some taunting from Namor, but is overpowered by the King. Before he could land a finishing blow, Namor is overpowered and captured by the Sirenas. While tending to his wounds, Brawn attends a meeting between Atlas, the Pan guard and the Sirenas. When Nguyen and the Sirenas' leader Sea Hunter propose to launch a retaliatory attack Atlantis, Amadeus objects, pointing out that the dragon was being manipulated into attacking Atlantis. Namora accuses the Sirenas as the culprits, revealing the dragon's implant to be made from Sirena tech.  After Namora and Carina of the Sirenas recount their people's history, Amadeus and the rest group find themselves torn between protecting Pan, attacking or defending Atlantis. Amadeus decides to go with Jimmy's group to Atlantis to defend it from the Sirenas while ordering Uranian, 3-D Man and M-11 to stay in Pan to reboot Pan's Pass codes in case of an invasion from Atlantis.  When Ikdea and Wave announce their intention to side with the Sirenas, the disagreement escalates into a brawl between the two parties. During the commotion, Namor is able to break free from his prison.<ref name="Atlantis Attacks #3">''Atlantis Attacks'' #3</ref> Namor swiftly subdues the combined group and flies back to the heart of Pan, threatening Nguyen and Pan's citizens as retribution for attacking his kingdom. A hologram of Nguyen offers an alliance between Pan, Atlantis and the Sirenas to Namor; before the king could retort the recovered Agents are able to catch up to Namor and resume fighting him.  Brawn talks down the combatants and confronts Woo over the secrets that he's withheld from the team.

Woo reveals to all that for thousands of years, ancient dragons have served as advisors for human rulers, with the Atlas Foundation having its own dragon, Mr. Lao, serving him as well. As fighting each other openly would raze the planet, dragons have used humans as proxies in their own personal conflicts against each other, making them responsible for almost every major war in history. Woo is content with this balance of power, but Nguyen suggests uniting the world under Pan, proposing to Namor and Woo that by harvesting the power of their dragons, they could overtake the rest of them. As Namor returns to Atlantis with Namora, Venus and Aero, the rest of the Agents uncover Nguyen in his personal bunker and confront him. Having anticipated this, Nguyen attaches a Sirena tech implant onto Amadeus, transforming him into the Hulk.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' #4</ref> Under Nguyen's control, the Hulk makes quick work of the Atlas Agents. To prevent any further invasions against Pan, Nguyen commands the Hulk to kill Namor, much to the shock and anger of Pan's citizens.

In Atlantis, just as Wave is able to get Namor and Carina to come to a truce, Silk warns the group a mild-controlled Hulk is on his way to destroy Atlantis. With help from the Agents, Namor is able to isolate himself and the Hulk to a deserted island two miles from the Heart of Pan for their fight. As the Hulk pummels Namor, Sword Master distracts him long enough for Shang-Chi to remove the device, freeing Amadeus from Nguyen's control and reverting him back to Brawn. Unfortunately they are too late, as the shockwaves emitted by Amadeus as the Hulk have created a massive [[tsunami]] that is heading towards the Heart of Pan. With some goading from Woo and Namor, Brawn transforms back into Hulk and creates another shockwave to weaken the tsunami with help from Namor, Wave, Aero and Luna. The city is saved, although Nguyen dies protecting a Madripoorian refugee and her young son from the tsunami.  One month later at the Heart of Pan, Woo announces to the Agents and Pan's new leadership at a banquet that Atlantis and the Sirenas have signed a non-aggression pact, recognizing Pan as an independent nation. Still feeling guilty for Nguyen's death and angered with Woo's machinations, Amadeus quits the team.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Amadeus is a teenager gifted with a super-genius mind, bearing the "natural ability to identify the variables and quantum possibilities in any situation". He is described by [[Reed Richards]] as being the 7th most intelligent person in the world,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> though [[Hank Pym]] claims that, with his return to Earth from Skrull captivity, Amadeus is actually the 8th.<ref name=autogenerated1/> Meanwhile, [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] claims he is actually the 10th,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #607</ref> but later says to the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] that Cho is one of the eight smartest.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #610</ref> The Eternal [[Ajak]] believes that Cho is actually more intelligent than some immortals,<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #118</ref> and he has claimed to [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]], who says that intelligence is essentially "pattern recognition", that he sees patterns better than 99.999999993% of people on Earth.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #116</ref> Hercules has claimed twice, the first instance to Athena herself, that Amadeus is smarter than even she,<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #124</ref><ref name="Chaos War #2"/> and the super-genius Olympian god of fire and blacksmith [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]] himself admits that Cho is more intelligent than he is.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #140</ref>

Amadeus is able to rapidly and without mechanical aid perform mental calculations of almost unimaginable complexity enabling him to, with minimal stimuli on his part, set multiple physical reactions into motion in his vicinity, forestalling technological and human activity with equal ease. This intelligence is portrayed in the comics as various numbers and other details labeled on everything he sees as relevant, shown from his [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. He has shown himself capable of doing anything from redirecting a laser-guided missile with a [[wing mirror]] to tracking the Hulk based on his [[trajectory]] and jump height. However, performing mental calculations in rapid succession costs him immense amounts of energy, requiring him to consume large amounts of food thereafter. He previously rode a Vespa scooter and carried a phone/radio, Walkman, or other device altered to control nearby electrical signals.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #610, Amadeus, along with hundreds of others, is zapped with the Cathexis Ray, which further enhances his intelligence. It also allows him to alter the laws of physics within a ten-foot radius of himself. He uses this power to shut down the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]'s equipment and revert [[MODOK]] to his original human form. He loses this power when [[Bruce Banner]] uses a recalibrated Cathexis Ray to remove the powers of the newly created Hulks.

When the helmet of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]], also known as the second Ant-Man, fell into Amadeus' possession, he, with [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]]'s blessing, chose to use it as a telepathic enhancer, downplaying the size changing aspect of the Ant-Man power to focus on the mind-controlling abilities on the insect mind instead<ref name=autogenerated1/>

Also, he has inherited Hercules' adamantine mace. He also uses [[Bruce Banner|Bannertech]] to augment himself with devices including scanners and forcefields.<ref>''Heroic Age - Prince of Power'' #1</ref>

After the "death" of Hercules, Amadeus is made the new Prince of Power and head of the Olympus Group by Athena. This status somehow protected him from certain effects of the Chaos King. He also has access to all of the Olympus Group's wealth and resources.{{issue|date=January 2017}}

Using a special device in his left arm, Amadeus Cho could turn into a Hulk and had the same powers as the original Hulk,<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #1</ref> but he lost most of the power. As Brawn, he now assumes a gamma-powered form that more closely resembles his normal appearance, but is weaker than his original Hulk form.  However, Amadeus is capable of turning back from his Brawn form into his original Hulk form when angered enough.<ref name="Atlantis Attacks #3"/>

==Kerberos the Coyote==
[[Image:AmadeusCho1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Amadeus Cho with Kirby the Coyote in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol 2 #106 (July 2007). Art by [[Gary Frank (comics)|Gary Frank]].]]
Amadeus was once usually accompanied by a coyote pup who peered out the front of Cho's jacket. He picked him up along the side of the road, near a roadside diner where he met the Hulk for the first time. The coyote's mother had been hit and killed by a car, but the pup had remained with her body. Cho, not failing to see the similarity, took him in. Cho has since trained him to distract opponents and perform simple search operations.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Kerberos's name was chosen in a contest held by the writers of the comic; the winner was a reader from Montevideo, Uruguay, Martín "MaGnUs" Pérez. The name was chosen by the reader both because of the [[Cerberus|mythological connotations]] and [[Kerberos (protocol)|the computer network authentication protocol of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=8977 |title=Incredible Hercules (2008) #118 &#124; Secret Invasion &#124; Comics |website=Marvel.com |access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TEoH2Eg8LgA/SFsSOPBKZeI/AAAAAAAAAvo/bitYYbeac7g/s1600-h/kerberos.jpg|format=JPG|title= Scan of the panel where the name is revealed|website=4.bp.blogspot.com|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref> Kerberos is also known by the [[hypocorism]] "Kirby".

During the Secret Invasion, it was revealed that Kirby was abducted immediately following ''World War Hulk'' by Skrulls posing as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents after they knocked out Amadeus with gas; Kirby was then replaced with a Skrull agent. The infiltrator was able to destroy the ship by driving it off course after disguising himself as Cho. He is slain by Cho's ally, Aton, who sees him transform back to Kirby and bites his head off. Using a tracking system he had implanted in the pup beforehand, Amadeus manages to track Kirby down, finding him in the Mojave Desert. Once there, he discovers that the now full-grown Kirby has adapted to the wild, even gaining a mate. Amadeus decides to leave Kirby where he is, reasoning that his life had become too dangerous for him.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #126</ref>

Banner attempts to evacuate the facility, whilst Amadeus uses flight technology to get onto the gamma bomb.
