Awwww! How long does this thing last? Whoa.  Those contorting Romanian chicks rule. Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical! Hey, we should start our ''own'' Cirque du Cheville. Let's go practice.  It's Kenny's singing! What?!  What's a "quin-tuplet"? But there's only four of you. So if you're identical, does that mean you all ''think'' alike? How can you say that? Oh, ''yeah!'' Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll ''never'' get our Cirque dei Ceville going.  You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there. Alright! Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now?? Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?! Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
