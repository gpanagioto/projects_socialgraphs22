+++++The episode begins with a bleak landscape. Everything in town looks abandoned and decayed. In the school playground, one of the swings is falling apart. At the bus stop, a shoe print echoes the one at the moon landing, while a Vons sign is on the ground nearby. Butters sits on the front steps to his house, his head on his hands, wearing an N95 face mask. His father Stephen exits the house wearing a mask, with a trash bag+++++
Butters : Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could go to Build-A-Bear today?
Stephen : Butters, for the last time, you can't go to Build-A-Bear!
Butters : But they said they were open again, so I-
Stephen : Yes, they're open, but we are not the Johnsons, and we do not go to nonessential businesses when it's nonessential! ''[looks out into the street. A group of four people walks by. Two of them are not wearing their masks properly]'' Hey, do you people mind?! You're supposed to wear your mask over your nose. Looks like you're wearing a diaper for your chin. Chin diapers don't help. ''[the group just moves off, followed by mumbling. More people walk by, eventually becoming a crowd]'' What the? What's going on now?!
Roger Donovan : Something at the town square. Everyone's gathering!
Stephen : Well are we protesting or are we rioting?
Roger : No no, it's something to do with the pandemic. Something big is going on.
Stephen : Stay here, Butters. ''[sets the trash bag down and joins the crowd]''
+++++The Town Square. The stage is set up, with a sign over it reading "SOUTH PARK BENEFIT FOR COVID-19" Behind him, the background said "WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER"+++++
Randy : Hey everybody. Can everyone hear me okay? Thanks for turning out, everyone. You know, we've all been through a lot these past several months. We've shut down and people have lost their businesses, lost their livelihoods. I also own a small business. I sell weed, and I have to say ... I'm actually doing pretty good. Amazing. ''[a business growth chart for 2020 pops up, showing how the business has grown since the pandemic began.]'' Tegridy Farms weed has seen a 400% increase in sales since the shutdown in March. I see Thomas Turner out there ''[Heidi's dad, shown with her mom]''. Thomas opened a restaurant in SoDoSoPa... doesn't seem like such a good idea now, does it, Turner? ''[a flash of anger appears on their faces]'' And there's Marley Jarvis, who owned and operated her own tanning salon. Whoops. But I just can't stand here and gloat, because Tegridy Weed is about giving back to people. And that's very proud to announce... that Tegridy Weed is having a Pandemic Special! ''[a collage of pictures taken over the year appears, with "$ PANDEMIC SPECIAL $" plastered over it]'' And all-new hybrid of our best weed sold at nearly 10% off our usual price. Not only that, but when you buy three pounds or more of the Pandemic Special you get a complimentary Pandemic 2020 bong ''[a large blue bong with PANDEMIC 2020 on it.]''. We are a community. Let's all be together... with Tegridy. ''[the Tegridy Farms logo pops up]''
+++++Randy and Sharon are driving home+++++
Randy : I think people are really excited. What do you think?
Sharon : A pandemic special, Randy?! Really?!
Randy : What?
Sharon : People are hurting! People are dying, Randy! And all you can think about is making a special about it?
Randy : ''[assertively]'' I'm doing positive to try and help. People really need this right now.
Sharon : You are a child, Randy! These are very serious times and nobody wants or cares about your stupid special right now!
Randy : ''[a bit softly]'' We'll see if they like my special.
+++++An aerial view of the suburbs. A drown zeroes in on Cartman's house. "SOUTH PARK Pandemic SPECIAL" appears on the screen.+++++
+++++Cartman's room. He's in bed, but wakes up refreshed and jumps up. A rod with a small "6'" flag sits by the bedroom door+++++
Mrs. Nelson : Good morning, guys. Everyone ready to start school? '' ''[Cartman's screen fills up windows of his classmates and teacher]'''
Clyde : Good morning.
Wendy : Hello.
Kyle : Hi.
Sef Furman : Hello.
Stan : I'm, I'm here.
Mrs. Nelson : Okay, I think we're all here. I see Jimmy and Clyde are on now. Eric, are you there?
Cartman : Yes, teacher, I'm here. I can't wait to start ''[fakes a computer glitch]'' schoo... schoo... schoo... oo... oo...
Mrs. Nelson : Oh no, Eric, I think your computer is freezing up again.
Cartman : Oh no? Can you guys hear me? I just said eh... eh... eh... eh...
Mrs. Nelson : Eric, you'll just have to listen again, okay? Best you can. So let's start today, guys, by going over yesterday's grammar examples. ''[Cartman puts up a tablet with the same facial expression he just made, making sure he can see it is his own Zoom window, and leaves]'' Wendy, can you read the first one?
Cartman : <poem><i>I'm cut off from the world, isolated, alone. This is what I can existencing. No one can touch me or boss me around. Social distancing-</i></poem> ''[grabs the rod and goes downstairs]''
Liane : ''[sees Cartman coming down the stairs]'' Eric, aren't you supposed to be on your Zoom call?
Cartman : ''[jabs at her with the rod as he goes to the kitchen]'' <poem><i>Stay away from me, Mom, yeah. You've got to keep your social distance. 'Cause all I'm gonna do is sing about how much I love you and need you, social distancing</i></poem> ''[pours himself some Cheesy Poofs cereal and milk]''
Liane : Sweetie, I know these are challenging times.
Cartman : Yeah Social distancing, Mom.
Liane : But we all still have to try and do our work.
Cartman : ''[between bites]'' Computer keeps freezing, Mom. Maybe, if you were an essential worker, we could afford faster Internet.
Liane : I at least need you to get some of your homework done, okay? And then m-maybe take a shower.
Cartman : Oh, what a folly a shower seems when my generation is being denied their lives. I can't see my friends. I can't even go to school. How I miss Kyle. Heh heh heh heh.
Liane : Sweetie, it's all going to be over soon. They're actually talking about school opening up again in a few days! ''[Cartman stops eating, then turns around to look at Liane]''
Cartman : What... the fuck... are you talking about?
Liane : There's going to be a big meeting. Sounds like they're trying to get you, kids, back in school!
Cartman : We can't go back to school: there's a fucking pandemic.
Liane : But they're talking about maybe staggering you kids every other day.
Cartman : They can't do that!
Liane : Eric, you're going to be able to be with all the other kids again!
Cartman : Oh no, I see! There's all this horrible stuff going on in the world, but apparently, Cartman's life doesn't matter! ''[storms out of the kitchen]''
Liane : ''[gives chase]'' Eric, you can't-
Cartman : ''[forces her back in the kitchen with his rod]'' Ahp! Get back! Get back! Six feet, Mom! Six fucking feet! ''[makes sure she doesn't move, then leaves]''
+++++Tegridy Farms, day. A sign on the farm's board says "Get Your PANDEMIC SPECIAL!!" Other signs promote safe distancing and safe curbside pick-up. A line of cars waits for its purchases. Randy has an umbrella out, as it's raining.+++++
Randy : ''[as a driver pulls away]'' Okay, thank you very much! Hope you enjoy the Pandemic Special! ''[another driver pulls up]'' Hi, you here for the special? Here you go.
+++++The farmhouse window, day, kitchen. Sharon is eating lunch when Stan walks up to the table and joins her.+++++
Sharon : How was school, Stanley?
Stan : It's not school! It's a freakin' joke. We're not even learning anything.
Sharon : I know this has all been really hard on you, Stanley. Do you wanna talk about it?
Stan : No, I'm fine, Mom! You know, I'm strong. I'm just worried about how this is all affecting weaker kids like, you know, like Butters.
Sharon : Yeah. Well, it's nice you care about our friend, but if you need to talk... I know this is really hard on everyone.
Randy : ''[Walks in happily]'' Well, that's it, guys. We have run out of weed for the day. ''[takes a seat next to Stan]'' Oh, hang on. Sorry, uh, didn't somebody say the pandemic special was a bad idea?
Sharon : I wasn't saying you wouldn't make money, I was saying maybe that's not what should matter right now!
Randy : Oh, come on, think about it. Do you even know anyone personally who's dying of COVID?
Sharon : Yes! My brother Jimbo, who is in the hospital!
Stan : Yeah, Uncle Jimbo.
Randy : Jimbo's a fat alcoholic who'd be in the hospital anyway. All I'm saying is that we let some dirty virus from "China" completely upend our lives and shut us down!
Sharon : Please do not quote the President in front of our child!
Randy : Sharon, I went to China, remember? Last season? I went there to sell our weed and ended up hanging out with Disney and Mickey Mouse. You remember all that? I know what China's like. Doesn't surprise me all this shit came from there.
Shelly : ''[off screen]'' We're going back to school!
Sharon : What?
Shelly : ''[peeks in]'' They're gonna let us go back to school! ''[runs out]''
+++++the living room. The TV is on and Shelly runs in to watch the news. Randy and Sharon join him+++++
Anchor Tom : The Park County School District is holding a parent meeting tomorrow, and officials are hopeful that students can return to school on Monday.
Stan : Wow, that's great!
Sharon : Oh, I don't know if this is a good idea.
Anchor Tom : The openings come on the heels that scientists are getting closer to finding the origins of the COVID pandemic.
Chief Scientist : Y-yes, we've been able to trace the virus and confirm that it did, in fact, come from a seedy part of China.
Randy : HA. Told ya! ''[turns and walks towards the kitchen.]''
Chief Scientist : And, in fact, we've pinpointed the virus to a certain bat in Wuhan.
Randy : ''[stops in his tracks and looks back]'' A bat in Wuhan?
Chief Scientist : What we still don't understand is, how did a transmitted disease get from a bat to a human? How can a virus jump species like that? We just don't know.
+++++Randy flashes back to his China trip last year, on which he's traveling with a bunch of other American companies to pitch their products to the Chinese. He remembers the landing and the arrest for the marijuana in his luggage...]'' +++++
Randy : Hello. Oh, Oh hey! ''[...his time in a Chinese prison making goods, his trial at a tribunal...]'' You could use some, Tegridy, China! ''[...celebrating the discharge with Mickey Mouse]''
Mickey Mouse : Here's to China! Haha.
Randy : To China!
+++++Some scenes that weren't seen in last year's episode, "Band In China": Randy and Mickey are at a bar downing some drinks+++++
Randy : Boy, you sure know how to party, Mick!
Mickey : Oh my God! Look at her! Haha! She's so hot! ''[Randy gets a good look at the female Mickey's looking at]''
Randy : I think that's a bat.
Mickey : Yeah! It's a bat! It's a mouse, with wings!
+++++outside the bar, Randy wanders the narrow streets looking for Mickey.+++++
Randy : Hey, Mick? Where'd you go? ''[stumbles upon Mickey fucking the bat]''
Mickey : Haha, haha. Oh boy!
Randy : Oooh!
Mickey : Haha! Randy, you gotta try it! Go ahead, take a turn!
Randy : ''[takes his turn and thoroughly enjoys it, then snaps out of the memory]''
Stan : If they're letting us go back to school, then soon we can get back to everything! I mean, doesn't this mean things are finally going back to normal? Dad?
Randy : I gotta go! ''[runs through the kitchen]''
+++++Walt Disney Co., Burbank, CA., day. In the corporate office, Mickey is fielding calls+++++
Mickey : Then sell fucking Epcot Center! If we can't get people on the rides, then sell the fuckin' thing! ''[hangs up that phone and switches to another]'' Nonono! I said MORE Mandalorian! ''[hangs up that phone]'' Jesus Christ! We're fucking dying here! ''[answers his cell phone]'' What?! Fucking what?! Haha.
Randy : Hey, it's Randy Marsh From, from Tegridy Farms?
Mickey : What do you want, Marsh?! I'm in the fuckin' weeds here!
Randy : Look, um, do you remember when we fucked that bat in Wuhan?
Mickey : I've fucked a lot of bats!
Randy : Well, I've only fucked one! I remember. Right after, I got really sick, and this was all back in October.
Mickey : Jesus Christ, you fucker! You started all this!
Randy : You told me to fuck the bat!
Mickey : You didn't quarantine yourself after you got home?!
Randy : Nobody knew anything about COVID when I fucked the bat! I thought I just came back from China with the flu! Look, we can't let scientists find that bat. My wife is crazy. If she finds out I started the pandemic, she's gonna be a total bitch about it. ''[Mickey is stunned]''
+++++The neighborhood. Cartman runs through it with his 6-foot pole. A couple walks their toy dog; he jabs the male aside with his pole. A jogger goes towards a park exit; he jabs him aside with his pole. He reaches Kyle's house and knocks on the door. Then he bangs on the door with the pole. Then he throws the pole through Kyle's bedroom window. Kyle opens the front door+++++
Cartman : Dude, you are not gonna believe this.
Kyle : What are you doing here??
Cartman : ''[barges in]'' Is your dad home, Kyle? We need to talk to a lawyer! Mr. Broflovski?!
Kyle : Dude, get out of my house! If you wanna talk, we can go outside!
Cartman : They're gonna try and make us go back to school.
Kyle : ''[covers his mouth and nose under his jacket]'' Dude, you could be spreading germs! ''[backs away]''
Cartman : Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle! They want us to go back. To school!
Kyle : So?
Cartman : "So?" What the fuck is-? You really wanna go back to that slavery?!
Kyle : I want an education! I want to be able to compete for a job when I get older!
Cartman : You crazy, psychotic... Kyle, we need to get a lawyer to stop schools from forcing us back! Now, whatever your messed-up beliefs are about "wanting to go to school"
Kyle : You really wanna spend the next year on Zoom?
Cartman : You don't have to be on Zoom, there's a million ways around it! Mark my words, Kyle: first they'll force us back to school, then they'll take social distancing away from us completely, and I'll be out of my room having to hang out with you!
Kyle : You're out of your room hanging out with me now!
Cartman : ''[realizes this]'' Oh my God. They won't get away with this!
+++++South Park, day. Randy walks down Main Street with his mask on, deep in thought. He hears a woman sobbing. He looks over to see an elderly woman weeping as her husband is carried out on a gurney into an ambulance. He walks by the town cemetery, where he sees a casket lowered into the ground. He then sees something that astonishes him: Red Robin going out of business due to COVID-19. As booth benches are being carried into trucks, Death appears and points to the interior. Randy turns away and cries silently+++++
Man with Orange Shirt : Hey! Excuse me ''[Randy turns to see him, and he approaches]'', y-you're Randy Marsh, right?
Randy : Uh... m-maybe.
Man with Orange Shirt : Yeah. Look man, I just wanna say thanks, you know? The Pandemic special is really amazing.
Randy : Oh yeah. Cool. Thank you.
Man with Orange Shirt : Nono, listen. You... you're awesome! All this horrible stuff going on and... well, you come along and try to fight it!
Randy : Okay, thanks.
Man with Orange Shirt : Y-you see, I... I lost my wife... to the virus. My kids, I... I don't even know how to talk to them, you know. Just... just thank God for your Pandemic Special. Thank God. It's a great special, it really is.
Randy : Okay.
Man with Orange Shirt : No, it's an awesome special. And i-and it was a great idea to do a special.
Randy : Okay okay, just stop! ''[runs away]''
+++++Mr. Mackey's home office. He's on a Zoom meeting with the parents+++++
Mr. Mackey : M'kay, welcome, parents, to this all-school town meeting to talk about how we're gonna get your kids back into the classroom. Can everyone hear me okay? ''[parents all replying]'' Okay, well, parents, we've made some amazing adjustments and hirings, m'kay? We believe we can welcome students back on Monday. M'kay?
Sheila : How are you going to do this?
Stephen : Yeah, what happens when my son is sitting in a room with Craig Tucker, whose father doesn't even wear a mask outside?
Thomas : Oh, here we fucking go again! Stop mask shaming, Stotch!
Stephen : Well, it's really not a mask if you wear it down around your chin. That's a chin diaper.
Thomas : There's no real proof that a mask even fuckin' does anything!
Stephen : Spoken like a true redneck!
Carol McCormick : Oh, fuck you! ''[everyone starts talking over each other. One of them says "That's not fair!"]''
Mr. Mackey : Okay. Okay, everyone. Alright. ''[presses a key on his computer to mute everyone else's microphone]'' Mmkay! I just muted everybody! Okay! Now, if we don't get along, I'll just sit here with you all on mute! ''[no one on screen is moving]'' Okay, now let's try this again. ''[presses a key and the mics are back on]''
Mrs. Tweek : I saw Wendy's mother not wearing a mask in the changing room at Ross.
Mrs. Testaburger : The fuck are you doing spying on me in the changing room?! I was at Ross- ''[accusing resumes]''
Mr. Mackey : Okay, BOOM! ''[silences the mics again]'' You're all muted! Mmkay?! I can do this all day! Now, we've made changes at the school, and we feel prepared to welcome your students back! ''[Roger Donovan raises his hand]'' Mr. Donovan!
Roger : I don't care what changes you've made, my son Clyde is not going to class!
Mr. Mackey : And that is your prerogative. Mute! ''[mutes Roger, unmutes Sharon]'' Mmkay, Mrs. Marsh.
Sharon : I thought that the issue was the teachers not coming back.
Mr. Mackey : That is correct. Our teaching staff does not feel safe to return, BUT... we have hired all new teachers, m'kay? These are people who have recently lost their jobs due to recent events and are desperate for work. Mmkay, so they'll do just about anything.
Stephen : What new teachers?
+++++South Park, day. The police force is now the new teaching staff. Harrison Yates addresses them outside the police station+++++
Yates : Alright, men! As you all know, due to recent events totally beyond our control, we have lost most of our funding. But this new venture will be great. and I know we will all thrive as elementary schoolteachers. This might be our last chance at a job, so I don't want any unnecessary deaths. ''[the officers groan "Awww!"]'' Ahp! Ahp! No unnecessary deaths! And let's show this town just what great leaders we can be. This is gonna be great.
+++++Tegridy Farms, day. Sharon gives Shelly and Stan their lunches+++++
Anchor Tom : All over South Park this morning, children are getting ready for their first day of class. And as they do, scientists say they're closer to finding a vaccine.
Stan : Oh cool! Turn it up!
Bill Keegan : Tom, I'm standing in front of the newly built viral research center where scientists say they have found the animal which started the coronavirus. ''[some lab scientists are shown working on samples]'' The creature was located in China and then flown to the facility here, where scientists are studying it thoroughly.
Randy : ''[peaks in upon hearing the report]'' Heyheyhey, whoa whoa! W-what are you guys doing?!
Stan : They think they're about to find the vaccine.
Chief Scientist : Yes, now that we have the animal in our possession, we'll finally be able to unlock what caused a virus to jump from it to humans.
Randy : ''[stands in front of the TV]'' Does it matter what started coronavirus?! Who cares what started coronavirus?! You guys are being racist! We don't need to watch this! Where's the remote? ''[begins looking all over the sofa]'' This is... this is racist television and we're not gonna watch it! ''[checks out the sofa on either side of Sharon]''
Sharon : I want to hear this, Randy!
Randy : No! No. You know what? You guys are horrible! Just, just stop it right now!
Bill Keegan : You traced the virus to Wuhan, but what you found was not a bat. Is that correct?
Chief Scientist : Nono, the virus did not come from a bat.
Randy : You guys- ''[stops mid-sentence]'' What? What did he say?
Chief Scientist : We were able to break down the virus enough to see there was actually no bat involved.
Randy : No bat involved. No bat involved! ''[dances around gleefully]'' Oh yeah! Oh yeah! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! In your face! In your face! It wasn't a bat!
Chief Scientist : When we tracked the virus, we found it did originate in Wuhan, but from a species called pholidota.
Bill Keegan : And what exactly is pholidota?
Chief Scientist : It's a pangolin. And here it is, right over here. ''[Bill Keegan and the Chief Scientist walk over to a cage holding the pangolin]''
Stan : What's a pangolin, Mom?
Sharon : I'm not even sure. Do you know what a pangolin is, Randy? ''[Randy is lost in a memory]'' Randy?
Stan : Do you know what a pangolin is, Dad?
+++++Randy flashes back to his time in China with Mickey. They're in the back seat of a taxi, tired+++++
Mickey : Haha haha. Dude, I still can't believe you fucked that bat. Haha.
Randy : Okaaay, okaaay, Shhhh.
Mickey : Haha. You really let her have it! Oh boy!
Randy : Okay! I don't wanna think about that right now, Mickey!
Mickey : I'm just impressed, that's all. I mean, if you can handle a bat, then...
Randy : Then what?
Mickey : You ever have sex with a pangolin?
Randy : What the fuck is a pangolin? ''[Mickey tells the driver in Chinese to stop]''
+++++A hotel room in Wuhan. While Mickey is the iPhone making more deals, Randy is fucking a pangolin+++++
Randy : Ha ha, ha whoa! ''[he's enjoying it rather thoroughly, then he snaps back to the present]'' Shit! ''[runs out of the farmhouse]''
+++++South Park Elementary. A sign over the entrance reads "Welcome Back Students!" The 4th Grade classroom is shown, with 12 decks instead of the usual 24. The desks are divided into groups of two. Each desk has a protective plastic shield in front and to the right, with a slot at the bottom for school work to be handed through. The officers are wearing clear plastic face shields, the kids are all wearing face masks+++++
Yates : Alright, children, welcome back to class. I'm your new teacher, Detective Harris, and this is our homeroom teacher's assistant, Officer Johnston. Let's start the day off with some math. Does anyone understand math? Who would like to lead the class with some math? ''[the sounds of a squealing pig approach the classroom door. The door opens, and Cartman is being carried in by two officers. He's mumbling gibberish, but then gets out a few sentences.]''
Cartman : Pandemic! There's a pandemic! You can't make me go to school! ''[the officers tie him to his chair]'' You can't! Argh! Araraaagh! Nonono! Nonono! You can't make me! You hear me?!
Yates : I don't know if I can do this, Mitch. I fuckin' hate kids. I can't be a teacher.
Mitch : It's all we got, sir ''[steps forward and assumes an assertive stance]'' Let me try. Kids! Alright, come on! Let's settle down! Now we're gonna do some fingerpaints. You got that? You're gonna fingerpaint... ''[reads from a small notebook]'' a marsupial of your choice or a fun thing you did over the summer.
Cartman : You can't make us stay here! This is a violation of our freedom! Who's with me, guys?!
Mitch : Now, listen! We're gonna start fingerpaintin' right now!
Cartman : Oh my God, I forgot how much it sucks to be around everybody! I think I'm gonna be sick, all over Kyle! ''[pretends to vomit and cough over Kyle]''
Kyle : Fuck you! ''[Kyle jumps out of his seat and beats him up. The other kids start cheering]''
Mitch : That's enough! ''[Harris beings out his service revolver and aims. Mitch does as well, and they fire away. A shot goes through Tolkien's front shield. A few more follow, and he takes a shot in the arm]''
Tolkien : Ow! ''[his left hand is over the wound. He falls out of his seat and onto the floor. Gunfire and cheering stop]''
Yates : Got 'im!
+++++South Park Viral Research Center, day. The pangolin is in its cage. A scientist shines a sensor onto it for a second+++++
Chief Scientist : ''[leads a new research team in and walks to the cage]'' Aaand here it is. This is the pangolin we tracked down in China, the animal that could lead us to a vaccine. The mysteries of COVID can be unlocked by our studies of this creature. I'll just ask you all to keep a good distance away. Obviously, we can't let anything happen to this pangolin. ''[Randy sneaks up behind the scientists]'' You see, this pangolin's DNA has mutated, which is what we believe started it all.
Scientist 1 : The pangolin has mutated, how?
Chief Scientist : We're not completely sure, but we believe now that something somehow... got its DNA up into the pangolin.
Scientist 2 : How exactly could that happen?
Chief Scientist : Well i-it's almost like another creature somehow inserted its DNA up into the pangolin.
Scientist 3 : Perhaps some other species somehow mated with the pangolin?
Scientist 2 : Oh, come on! What kind of animal would have sex with a pangolin?
Scientist 1 : Yeah! Look how ugly that thing is!
Scientists : ''[chuckle at the possibility]'' Yeah, yeah.
Randy : Okay, Okay.
Chief Scientist : Again, what really matters is that we decode the foreign DNA inside the pangolin. That would be the key to the vaccine, perhaps even a cure. We have to know what raped the pangolin.
Randy : Oh, so now it was "rape."
Chief Scientist : Excuse me, sir. Who are you? ''[Randy stays silent]'' This tour is for scientists that specialize in pandemics. Are you... a pandemic specialist?
Randy : Yeah I'm a pandemic specialist. I'm making one right now.
Chief Scientist : Uh-kay. Anyway, if you all follow me now to the micro labs, I can show you the containment system for once a vaccine is able to be tried. ''[Randy pretends to walk with them but pulls back to the cage. He takes the pangolin out and struggles with it for a few seconds, then stuffs it down his pants and sneaks away.]''
+++++South Park Elementary, day. A crowd of parents has gathered in front of the school. Mr. Mackey and the police officers look back at them. Mr. Mackey pulls out his bullhorn and turns it on, causing a reverb+++++
Mr. Mackey : M'kay. mmkay, parents? Can everyone hear me okay? ''[the crowd is shown from his point of view - they all have masks, but have lowered them to speak]'' Everyone listens up. We don't want anyone to panic, okay, but there has been a COVID exposure here at the school. ''[parents gasp]'' Okay, one of our fourth graders was taken to the hospital a couple of hours ago, okay? But we think Tolkien's gonna be okay. Now, due to county protocol, everyone that was in the school now has to quarantine for two weeks. So we will be keeping your kids here, and the teachers will be staying with them. ''[parents shout back.]''
+++++The school gym, day. All the school kids are here, not just the fourth graders. They are talking amongst themselves+++++
Yates : Alright, students. shut up. ''[conversations fade off]'' I know this situation is not ideal, but we all have to quarantine together for two weeks.
Cartman : This is bullshit!
Yates : You don't want to infect your families, do you? You were all exposed to a student here who was taken to the hospital due to COVID. Yes?
Stan : Uh, we were there, and Token was actually taken to the hospital because you guys shot him.
Yates : Yes, due to COVID. If it weren't for COVID, all the previous teachers would have still been here, we wouldn't have been in the class, and nobody would have gotten shot. Therefore, the young man is in the hospital due to COVID.
Officer 1 : It was COVID-related.
Stan : That doesn't make any sense!
+++++Tegridy Farms, day. Randy watches the news in the living room+++++
Newsman : And scientists are asking all South Park County residents to keep an eye out for the creature. Once again, the pangolin escaped from the facility yesterday, and many people are fearing the worst. Scientists say that even though they have samples from the pangolin, they now don't have what they need for a vaccine.
Chief Scientist : Yes. You see, what we needed was the foreign DNA that was up inside the pangolin. It's whatever that DNA was that was our key to the cure. ''[someone outside sees Randy and whistles to him. Randy looks over and cowers a bit]''
Delivery Express Man : Hello! Anyone home?? ''[Randy gets up and goes outside to see who it is. It's a delivery man with a package for him]'' Got a delivery here. Needs a signature.
Randy : ''[relieved]'' Oh, okay.
Delivery Express Man : Oh, he-hey, if you're gonna come any closer, would you mind wearing a, you know, chin diaper?
Randy : Oh, sorry. ''[reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a face mask and puts it on... as a chin diaper. They approach each other.]''
Delivery Express Man : Here you go. Just sign right there. ''[Randy signs a small tablet and hands it to the delivery man, who hands him the package]'' Have a nice day. ''[they part ways, but the delivery man turns around]'' Oh, and hey, I'm really loving the pandemic special.
Randy : Yeah thanks. ''[he goes inside and opens the package, but drops it once he says what's inside: a bloody heart with "YOU'RE DEAD" written in blood on one of the flaps. Randy is afraid, yet puzzled]''
+++++The barn. Randy calls up Mickey+++++
Randy : Why did you send that to me?
Mickey : Haha. Because you're a dead man, Marsh. It's your DNA that they need for a vaccine! Haha!
Randy : Yeah, I know, but I can't just turn myself in!
Mickey : This isn't personal, Marsh. It's business. I'm having you killed, then secretly we'll send your DNA to the scientists for the vaccine. Haha.
Randy : This is all your fault, Mickey Mouse! You made the deal with the devil when you sold your Mulan shit to China! And then you took me out and sold me on how great China was, and how we should all suck their dick! You made me lose my tegridy and anything special that I had-! ''[stops]'' Special. Wait a minute. That's it!
Mickey : What's it? Haha.
Randy : The Special. The Pandemic Special! That's how we can get my DNA into people! We can vaccinate them without them even knowing!
Mickey : What are you talkin' about?
Randy : Just give me a couple of more days before you have me killed. I-I think I know a way out of this.
+++++Hell's Pass Hospital, night. The hospital has set up a COVID-19 ward. where the sickest patients are housed. In the still of the night, one hears only monitors and ventilators. Jimbo is in one room with a picture of himself and Stan, and a sign above his bed wishing him well. Someone pounds on something nearby. Jimbo opens his eyes and notices the window... and the spooky figure outside of it. The figure opens the window and jumps in - it's Randy+++++
Jimbo : Randy?
Randy : Shhh. Hey Jimbo.
Jimbo : Wha-what are you-?
Randy : It's okay, Jimbo. I think I might have a cure for COVID. ''[he brings out a jar of Tegridy Weed and opens the lid, then pats Jimbo on the shoulder]'' You're just gonna have to trust me, okay? ''[walks off and masturbates into the jar, then rolls a joint, walks over, and motions for Jimbo to keep quiet]''
Jimbo : Uh, uh...
Randy : Shhhh, this is gonna be great.
Jimbo : No, uh... ''[Randy lifts up the oxygen mask and puts the joint in Jimbo's mouth]''
Randy : It's okay, it's okay. Just breathe. Breeeathe. ''[Jimbo coughs]'' It's okay. It's okay, breathe.
+++++South Park Elementary, day. "QUARANTINE AREA. DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION." In another 4th Grade classroom, the students are working on an assignment in silence as the assistant monitors them with a baton in hand. During recess, another officer monitors Wendy as she swings silently. At the computer lab, a sign next to the door says "PARENT ZOOM VISITATION 5 MINUTES MAXIMUM." An officer stands guard outside. A few kids are inside talking to their parents on Zoom+++++
Mr. McArthur : ''[to his Red]'' We miss you, honey. We can't wait for quarantine to be over! Huh.
+++++in the school gym, kids are inside playing with various sports balls. Stan dribbles a basketball until a whistle blows, then stops. In the cafeteria, several kids eat lunch socially distant from each other. A buzzer blares+++++
Officer 2 : Group 4, your meal is over! Back to your class! ''[motions the kids to head for the entrance. The kids take their trays, dispose of the meals, and exit]''
Officer 3 : Alright. Group 5, it's now mealtime. Come in, but keep your social distance. ''[the next group comes in, including Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman.]'' Yeah, that's good social distancing. Real good.
Butters : ''[muttering to himself]'' March 16th. It was March 16th! That's how long it's been! It was supposed to be a party! A big, happy gathering at Build-A-Bear to celebrate me being a big boy at the dentist! Then they shut it all down. They said I'd have to wait until April. And then it was May. And then they said, "Wait until summer." It's fucking October now! ''[swats his lunch away, then hops onto the table to rant. Four officers behind him by the wall react]'' Why doesn't anyone tell me the truth?! ''[grabs Monica's lunch then throws that away]'' That I'm never going to Build-A-Bear! ''[one of the officers taps his baton against his anti-riot shield, and two officers to his left move forward]'' That I'm never going ever again!
Stan : ''[notices the officers moving towards Butters]'' Butters, Butters, you gotta calm down.
Butters : I'm never going to Build-A-Bear, am I?! ''[the officers flank him]'' Oh, hey teachers. Sorry. ''[they carry him out of the cafeteria]'' W-wait, I'm sorry. I don't need to go to Build-A-Bear! Fellas?! ''[the other kids are stunned]''
+++++Tegridy Farms day. A customer honks his car horn. Randy is asleep in his underwear. Sharon walks up to him+++++
Sharon : Randy? Where are the car keys? Randy!
Randy : Huh? Uh, what? What?
Sharon : Where are the car keys?
Randy : They're probably in my pants pocket. Why?
Sharon : I have to get over to the hospital.
Randy : The hospital? For what?
Sharon : It's Jimbo. Doctor said he's better, so I can take him home.
Randy : Jimbo's better?
Sharon : They said he doesn't have any symptoms, and his tests are showing negative.
Randy : Holy shit. ''[realizing that his DNA might have just saved Jimbo's life.]''
+++++The barn. Randy walks up to a jar of Tegridy Weed.+++++
Randy : It works. It can help. ''[opens the jar and masturbates into it. Then he faces shelves and shelves of jars and realizes he has to masturbate into all of them.]'' Hoh boy. ''[he unzips his pants and drops them]''
+++++South Park Elementary, day. Kyle walks down the hall, Stan catches up to him+++++
Stan : Kyle, I need to talk to you.
Kyle : Hey dude.
Stan : I'm really worried. About Butters. I think he's sick.
Kyle : You think he got the virus?
Stan : No! It's all the other stuff. The isolation and the uncertainty. ''[put his hands in his jacket pockets and wanders off]'' I'm just really worried what all the stuff around COVID is doing to some kids. You know, not every kid is like us. There's some kids who really can't take it anymore.
Kyle : I know. This bullshit sucks. But Butters will be okay.
Stan : ''[getting emotional]'' And what if he's not? What if Butters is actually starting to lose his mind? What if he feels his body shutting down right now?
Kyle : You really think it's that bad?
Stan : It's time for us to ask for help. From someone who has more authority at this school than these cops.
+++++The White House, day. In the Oval Office, Pres. Garrison looks out the window, his back to the entrance+++++
Male Aide 1 : Mr. President, the CDC is on the line. They need to speak with you urgently!
Garrison : Tell them to suck my asshole.
Female Aide : Mr. President, Dr. Fauci is on line 2 and the FDA chief is on line 3.
Garrison : Ooo! Tell Fauci to shove it up his ass, and let the FDA chief know he can eat shit off my balls.
Male Aide 2 : Sir! Sir, you have an urgent call on line 4 from a Mr. Slave?
Garrison : ''[turns around in his chair and wonders]'' Mr. Slave? Okay, go, gogogo! ''[the aides leave and Garrison clears his throat. He picks up the phone]'' Yes, this is the President of the entire United States.
Stan : Uh, hi, it's Stan Marsh.
Garrison : Stan Marsh? Where's Mr. Slave?
Stan : I'm sorry. We had to get your attention. Listen, we're being kept at the school, and one of the students here is really sick.
Garrison : Oh, for Pete's sake, here we go again. ''[rolls his eyes and closes them]'' Just deal with it. I am busy.
Stan : Nono, Mr. President, please! You gotta come back to South Park. Our teachers are shooting people. Everyone's arguing and, and there's a facility outside of town that found the pangolin and are working on a vaccine! You might be able to stop the pandemic.
Garrison : Why would I do that?
Stan : ...Huh?
Garrison : Stan, this is gonna be very difficult for a child to understand, but I made a promise to the American people- to get rid of all the Mexicans.
Stan : But the pandemic isn't just killing Mexicans.
Garrison : It's killing a lot of them. I've gone over the statistics, Stan. ''[walks over to a chart showing U.S. COVID fatalities by race. Mexicans are by far the most affected ethnicity, and whites the least affected.]'' All I have to do now is sort of guide the avalanche in the right direction, and I'm fulfilling my promises to the American People. I was doing a crap job until this pandemic happened.
Stan : You're just gonna sit there and not do anything?!
Garrison : I am going to actively not do anything. And you can eat shit off my balls and die. ''[hangs up]''
Stan : God dammit!
+++++Tegridy Farms, day. A line of cars waits at the entrance, with horns honking. A small booth is by the mailbox. Randy is using a cane to support himself. All that masturbation has weakened him+++++
Randy : Ogh. Ogh-o. ''[limps to the next customer]'' Okay, there you go. That's all I can sell you right now. Just make sure you smoke it, okay? Enjoy the special. ''[the customer drives off. He limps back to the small booth]'' Han-hang on, guys. I gotta prep some more. Just give me like four minutes. ''[enters the booth and masturbates into the next jar.]''
Sharon : ''[comes out of the house]'' Randy?!
Randy : Ogh.
Sharon : Randy?!
Randy : Just... ''[irked]'' what?!
Sharon : Randy, you've gotta get in here!
Randy : I'm doing something important, Sharon! People need this right now!
Sharon : Come upstairs. Something's wrong with Jimbo! ''[Randy slowly limps upstairs.]'' He's just been sleeping for days. ''[puts her mask on and goes to Jimbo's room]'' They said he was getting better. ''[Randy limps forward, holding his crotch]'' Last night his fever came back. And then a few hours ago, this thing appeared on his face.
Randy : What thing? ''[Sharon slowly lowers Jimbo's mask, and ... it's Randy's mustache. Randy's jaw drops]''
Sharon : Jimbo's never been able to grow a mustache.
Randy : Huh. That's weird.
Sharon : Should I call the doctor?
Randy : No! Nonono! Don't call the doctor! They're busy. These are u-un- precedented times. W-we have no idea what caused this.
Jimbo : ''[slowly]'' Special...
Sharon : What, Jimbo?
Jimbo : Pandemic... uh special...
Sharon : ''[looks at Randy]'' Why's he talking about your special?
Randy : ''[rapidly]'' Everyone's talking about the special, Sharon. It's a big deal. He obviously needs it right now.
Sharon : I'm gonna get the thermometer. ''[walks away. Randy quickly goes to Jimbo's side]''
Randy : ''[whispering angrily]'' Just fucking shut up! You have no idea if it's because of the special. You could just be sick again 'cause you're a fat, fuckin' alcoholic, and I am not going to jail for you! ''[smacks him and walks away, holding his crotch and grimacing]''
+++++Hell's Pass Hospital, day. A doctor is checking out the mustache on Gerald's face, which is different from the one he usually has.+++++
Dr. Doctor : And you say you've never had a mustache before?
Gerald : No! Never! It just came outta nowhere!
Sheila : How can this happen, Doctor?
Dr. Doctor : Have you put anything toxic in your body lately? Any drugs or alcohol?
Gerald : No! I mean... I've enjoyed a little of the Pandemic Special...
Dr. Doctor : Oh, nonono. That-that's totally fine.
Nurse : Doctor? You better come to the emergency room! ''[they both go to the ER, which is filled with patients, including women, who have the pandemic mustache.]''
Dr. Doctor : Holy shit!
+++++Breaking news. COVID-19 UPDATE?+++++
Anchor Tom : Another strain of COVID, or simply more COVID-related symptoms? A reported 1 in 10 people in Park County are experiencing mustaches, and nobody seems to know why. The Mayor has called for help from infectious disease experts, and Dr. Anthony Fauci arrived at South park Hospital today to give his advice.
+++++Hell's Pass Hospital entrance. Dr. Fauci addresses the crowd+++++
Dr. Fauci : We aren't sure why some people are getting a mustache and some aren't, but we have to do all we can to avoid it becoming fashionable.
Man 1 : Will our chin diapers keep us safe?
Dr. Fauci : Yes, but we must wear them where the mustache would be. We need to wear them over our mouth and nose.
Stephen : Are you out of your mind? You expect people to wear a diaper over their nose? That's disgusting! Fuck you, Fauci!
+++++Back to the news report+++++
Anchor Tom : Citizens are asked to stay indoors and just try and relax, and maybe enjoy some of the Pandemic Special.
Randy : Nooo! Shit! ''[Sharon has her hands over her mouth]''
+++++South Park, night. The school gym is shown from above. Twenty-nine students are sleeping there, each in his own circle. Stan is wide awake, looking at the ceiling. An officer sits in the coach's office looking at a jar of Tegridy Weed+++++
Officer 4 : Nice. ''[Stan sits up. He looks to his left and sees Death staring back at him through a window, then crawls up to Butters and shakes him awake]''
Stan : Butters. Butters!
Butters : Wha?
Stan : Don't worry. I'm going to save you!
Butters : Okay. Save me from what? ''[nods off, and Stan walks to the middle of the gym]''
Stan : Guys, guys! ''[claps. The kids begin to stir]''
Students : What? Who is it?
Stan : Shhh. You guys, we have to get Butters out of here.
Kyle : Who else can we call, Stan?
Stan : No! We have to get him out of here! Now! We need to take him... to Build-A-Bear.
Craig : Are you nuts??
Stan : He has to go out and do something normal!
Jimmy : Stan, Build-A-Bear is currently by appointment only, and only a maximum party of four can visit at one time.
Stan : We can't wait around and wait for people to figure things out, okay?! It's not gonna happen! They just keep taking everything from him and saying it's for his own good! But who's to say he can't go out and have a little goddamn fun?! If we want things to go back to normal, then we just gotta go do it!
Cartman : ''[stands up]'' Stan's right. If we want things to go back to normal, we have to do it ourselves.
Stan : They're just gonna be making more restrictions, and more rules, and who's gonna fight to go back to the way things were?
Cartman : I sure as hell will!
Stan : We can make things normal for Butters again, and make school the way it was!
Cartman : The way it was! Online, in our own rooms!
Stan : Wait, what? No, in a class, with real teachers!
Cartman : Wait, what? What normal are you talking about?
Stan : I'm talking about normal, like back in March. What normal are you talking about?
Cartman : I'm talking about normal, like three days ago, when everything was awesome.
Stan : Look it doesn't matter. We just gotta break the fuck out of here.
+++++The hallways. Sef Furman runs down the hall; the police do not notice. Craig and Tweek follow the boy, then the Boy with Brown Hair and Red Shirt follows them. The rest of the class follows, including Timmy whose wheelchair moves loudly. At the front of the school, Jimmy heads towards the bolted doors with bolt cutters+++++
Timmy : TIMMAH! ''[cuts the bolt, and the chain drops to the floor. The kids rush out the door and pour out of the school triumphantly]''
+++++News Break. COVID-19 UPDATE+++++
Anchor Tom : The new outbreak in South Park is spreading rapidly, and as highways into town close and governments consider a full lockdown, one question is on everyone's mind: where is the damn pangolin?! Some speculate the pangolin took its own life, while others think that- ''[something is being whispered in his ear]'' Sorry. Sorry, we're getting some breaking news. Oh, God. Students at South Park Elementary have broken quarantine and are now out on the loose!
Bill Keegan : ''[outside the school, during the day]'' The fugitives broke out sometime last night. Teachers are reporting there's no cause for alarm, except that these children have all been exposed to COVID ''[his voice gets more urgent]'' and could be running around spreading mustaches right now!
Woman : ''[hears this and screams]'' Aaaaaaaaow! ''[This sets off a mass panic]''
Man 2 : Super-spreaders! ''[drivers get into near-collisions, shoppers stock up on toilet paper and other goods, ]''
Stocker : ''[notices a woman carrying two cans]'' One can of shaving cream per family! ''[Park County Shoes is broken into and looted]''
Stephen : ''[he and Linda have their masks on as chin diapers]'' Butters?! Butters, you get back to quarantine or you are gonna be grounded!
Thomas : Hey, Stotch! ''[Stephen looks over and sees that Thomas has his mask on properly]'' You heard what the scientist said! Get your diaper up over your mustache area!
Stephen : I'm not wearing a damn diaper over my nose!
Mrs. Testaburger : Don't you care about people?
Stephen : Yeah, we care way more about what's right than you do, bitch! ''[walks up and punches her once, and she goes down. Thomas punches him in return]'' Oh! ''[a brawl breaks out in the street]''
+++++The Mayor's Office. She looks out over the rioting while she's on the phone+++++
Mayor McDaniels : For Christ's sake, the entire town is in chaos! How the hell did you let those kids out of quarantine?!
Yates : ''[at the school, with all his officers at attention]'' Don't blame this on us teachers! You opened the school and gave us barely enough resources to do our job!
Mayor McDaniels : Everyone is terrified of catching something from these super-spreaders!
Yates : Well, I don't know what you're gonna do, Mayor. You took all our funding away. You said our equipment was too extreme. Now, if we had some of that stuff back...
Officer 1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yates : Tsst-tst-tst-ch-ch-ch!
Mayor McDaniels : We certainly don't want you, teachers, to be without every resource available. I'll write an executive order to get you everything you need.
Yates : ''[hangs up]'' Boys? We are back in business!
Officers : ''[cheering]'' YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!...
+++++The police roll-out with patrol cars and Peacemaker tanks. Motorcycle and equestrian units with semiautomatics join them. An officer arms a bazooka. K9 units join in. It's a massive show of force.+++++
Yates : Possible COVID exposure at 4 o'clock! ''[the Boy with Brown Hair and Red Shirt is building a snowman. Yates gets on the bullhorn]'' You there. ''[the boy looks up]'' You are violating a mandated safer-inside order! Put down the snowball and get back to quarantine! ''[the boy drops the snowball]'' We've got a runner! ''[the police fire all their weapons and decimate the boy. Kenny and Annie Knitts run down the street and Kenny is shot to death. Two officers walk by Univers Coffee, then Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Butters come out of hiding]''
Stan : Okay, all clear! Come on! Go go go! ''[Butters is lying down in a small wagon, the other three wheel him down the sidewalk]'' All right, you ready to have some fun, Butters?
Butters : I sure am, fellas!
Kyle : Okay!
Stan : Shit shit, get back, back, back, back, back! ''[they hide in Parking Lot A. Death rides by and they come back out]'' Okay, all good. Come on. ''[They reach a plaza]''
Kyle : Dude, we made it.
Stan : Butters, Butters. ''[wakes Butters up]'' Look! ''[Butters looks up and sees Build-A-Bear Workshop]''
Butters : Whoa! Is it really for reals?
Stan : Yeah, it's real. Come on! We got an appointment! ''[helps Butters out of the wagon. They reach the entrance, only to see James the shopkeeper closing the shop.]'' Oh, uh hey, excuse me. We had an appointment.
James : Oh no, s-sorry. We're closed.
Stan : But I called. Y-you said you were open today for appointments.
James : Yeah, we had to shut down again. Somebody came into the store with a mustache.
Kyle : A mustache?
Stan : Ple-hease, my friend has to build a bear.
James : ''[walks away]'' I'm sorry! These are unprecedented times!
Stan : Ohoh, just give us one minute!
Butters : Oh! Good job, Stan! Thanks for getting my hopes up, you asshole!
Kyle : ''[walks up to Stan with Cartman]'' Come on, dude. We'd better get outta here before we're spotted.
Stan : We can't go.
Kyle : What do you mean?
Stan : We don't have a choice. We're gonna have to break in.
Kyle : And then do what?
Stan : And then build him a bear.
Cartman : Without any employees? What, do you expect us to just, just... build our own bear?
Stan : If we have to, yes!
Kyle : Dude, you need people to help you do the stuffing and the closing. You don't- you don't actually build your own bear.
Stan : I don't care! I'm not following the rules anymore!
+++++Tegridy Farms, day. Randy is piling his unsold Tegridy Weed onto the company truck. After the second load, Sharon stops him.+++++
Sharon : What the hell are you doing?!
Randy : I just... gotta take all the Pandemic Special over to Thompson Lake and dump it.
Sharon : Dump it? Why are you worrying about this right now?!
Randy : Because the Pandemic Special needs to end! A special has to end, Sharon, or else it's not really a "special," is it?! ''[runs for some more weed]''
Sharon : Goddammit, Randy, our son is out in this chaos! ''[heads towards the driver's seat]'' This is not the time for you to be dealing with your fucking marijuana! ''[hops into the seat and closes the door]'' Somebody's gotta find him! ''[starts the engine]''
Randy : Nono, okay, okay, okay, hold on! I'm coming! ''[gets into the passenger seat]'' Maybe we can just drop the special by the lake on the way.
Sharon : Fuck you!
+++++Build-A-Bear Workshop, day. The boys have broken in+++++
Stan : Here we are, Butters! Look! You made it!
Butters : Oh boy, is this a dream?
Stan : No, it's not a dream! We are really here, and we are going to build you a bear! Which one you want? You want the panda? You want the Bronco koala?
Butters : The Caballero Grizzly.
Stan : Caballero Grizzly. ''[gets the materials needed]'' Okay, we just find the sh-shell and the uh, the outfit.
Cartman : Stan, you really need employee assistance with this.
Stan : It's gonna fucking work! Just fucking shut up! ''[take the shell to a stuffer]'' Okay! Okay, Butters. Look! ''[starts the machine]'' We're gonna put the stuffing in!
Butters : Wow!
Stan : Okay, uh, um... ''[starts pressing buttons. All of a sudden, the shell is pumped full of cotton and explodes]''
Butters : Aaaah! God! Daaagh!
Stan : It's okay! We can start over! We can start over! There'a do-over machine right over there! Look! ''[walks over to a shredder and drops the mangled bear in. The shredder has a window through which the bear is seen being destroyed.]''
+++++South Park. The rioting continues. Sharon drives through it+++++
Sharon : Stanley! Staaaaan! What if he's dead, Randy?!
Randy : He's not dead, Sharon.
Sharon : Then why hasn't he even called?! ''[two people jump onto the truck, both with mustaches]''
Man 3 : Hey, can we have some of that Pandemic Special?
Randy : No! ''[the men slip off the truck]'' Nobody needs the special right now! It's not helping! ''[looks out the passenger-side window]'' Oh my God. Oh God no.
Sharon : What?? ''[they see Applebee's closed, and two men carrying a table into a moving truck.]''
Randy : ''[sheds a tear]'' They got Applebee's too. [turns to Sharon] Drive me back to the farm, Sharon. I need to get something.
+++++Build-A-Bear Workshop, day. Stan is trying to build another bear, but the cotton isn't going in+++++
Stan : God dammit! ''[looks out the window and sees Death there. Stan tries one more time to fill the shell, but the gust of air knocks him to the ground. Stan gets right back up to try again]''
Kyle : Dude, just let it go.
Stan : No, Kyle, we can't let Butters down!
Kyle : ''[walks up to Stan]'' Stan, are you sure this is about Butters? 'Cause you seem really desperate to build a bear.
Yates : ''[on his bullhorn outside]'' Attention protesting looters. ''[the boys look over and walk up to the entrance]'' Protesting slash looting is a violation of the Mayor's health order! You have five minutes to come out or we will have to take action
Butters : We gotta surrender, fellas. I'm honestly not having that much fun anyway.
Stan : No! I'm not giving up!
Yates : All right, that was about five minutes. ''[on the bullhorn to the officers]'' Okay, boys! Light 'em up! ''[an officer aims a cannon at Kyle, who has his back to the window]''
Randy : ''[steps into the cannon's scope]'' Wait! Everyone just stop!
Yates : Who the hell is that?
Randy : I have something that might change all of this! ''[reaches into a bag and pulls out the pangolin. The crowd gasps]''
Stephen : It's the pangolin.
Thomas : Look!
Other townsfolk : The pangolin! He's found it! The pangolin! Whoa!
Randy : This... is what you've all be looking for, right? Well here! Go ahead and do all the tests you want on it. You'll find out... everything you need to know. ''[the crowd murmurs]''
Cartman : Oh no! You're not ending this pandemic! ''[grabs the pangolin and runs back inside the store]''
Kyle : Hey!
Stan : Cartman, no! ''[follows Cartman inside with Kyle. Cartman prepares to drop the pangolin into the store's shredder]'' Don't do it, Cartman! That thing is our only chance!
Cartman : ''Your'' only chance! For ''your'' normal, not ''mine!'' I am ''not'' going back to school!
Stan : You guys were right, okay? This hasn't been about Butters. I've been acting like this because I can't take these shutdowns anymore, and I'm scared what it's doing to me! I'm looking for whom to blame. Saying I'm trying to help people to make myself feel better because the truth is... I just wanna have fun again. ''[Cartman looks at him]'' I wanted to see that I could go out in the world and do things that I used to do, but I can't. I'm not any better, and I don't care any more than anyone else. And I did all this ''[tears well up in his eyes]'' because I just want my life back! I just want my life back... ''[begins to weep silently. Cartman's look softens. He looks at the shredder, at the boys, then steps down from the shredder, carries the pangolin out of the store, and gives it to the Chief Scientist]''
Kyle : ''[awed by this act of mercy]'' I don't believe it.
Stephen : So, so what happens now?
Chief Scientist : Now we have hope. We've learned that we might never get back our old lives, but by working together, we just might find a new way to- ''[a plume of flame attacks the pangolin and the Chief Scientist. Behind this act is President Garrison with a flamethrower. Garrison doesn't let up until the Chief Scientist no longer screams.]''
Garrison : Don't forget to get out and vote, everybody! Big election coming up. ''[turns around and walks away]''
+++++Tegridy Farms, evening. A banner covers the sign: "CLOSED DUE TO FIRES"+++++
Radio reporter : And since the students broke quarantine, all South Park residents are now exposed and under complete lockdown for the unforeseeable future. ''[a wall of flames looms in the distance. Death appears in the field, then gets on his bike and rides away. Randy looks at his phone. The lock screen has a picture of his family in it.]''
Randy : How do I even begin to apologize? You guys were right. I think all the marijuana really did go to my head. You said it: a drug is a drug, and... I'm not who I used to be. It's time for me to own up to everything. It's time everyone knew what started this pandemic. ''[walks into the house and upstairs, and enters his bedroom. He finds Sharon asleep and walks to the bed]'' Hey, Sharon, I need to talk to you. ''[sits down]'' I'm not as strong as you are, Sharon. I can't deal with hard times the way that you can. ''[Sharon sits up, and her new mustache is quite visible]''
Sharon : If you're ready to talk, I'm ready to listen, Randy. ''[Randy looks at her and has no words]'' What?
Randy : ...You want nothing to do with the Pandemic Special.
Sharon : No. I don't smoke marijuana, Randy.
Randy : Uh huh. ''[gets up and walks off]''
Sharon : Well, what did you want to talk to me about?
Randy : I just... think maybe I'm gonna do a few more specials. You got some shit on your face. ''[leaves the room. Sharon reaches for her upper lip]''
