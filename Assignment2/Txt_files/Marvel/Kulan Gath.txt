'''Kulan Gath''' is a fictional [[villain]]ous [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[Dynamite Entertainment]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' #15 (May 1972) as a foe of Conan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=208}}</ref>

He was later fully integrated into the [[Marvel Universe]], and he became popular for his appearances in ''X-Men''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sims|first=Chris|title=Bizarro Back Issues: Avengers vs. X-Men… vs. Evil Time Traveling Wizard Magic (1985)|url=https://comicsalliance.com/avengers-vs-xmen-wizard/|access-date=2021-10-29|website=ComicsAlliance|language=en}}</ref><ref name=Morris>{{Cite web|last=Morris|first=Bryce|date=2021-08-20|title=Marvel's Darkest Sorcerer Turned New York Into a Savage Medieval Realm|url=https://screenrant.com/kulan-gath-xmen-spiderman-conan-new-york-medieval/|access-date=2021-10-29|website=[[ScreenRant]]|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2006, he was also used by [[Dynamite Entertainment]] when they secured the rights to [[Red Sonja]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Allen|first=Todd|date=2018-09-18|title=A Drunken Santa Crosses Paths with Kulan Gath – Red Sonja Holiday Special|url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/a-drunken-santa-crosses-paths-with-kulan-gath-red-sonja-holiday-special/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-03|website=The Beat|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
===Conan era===
Kulan Gath was a sorcerer in Earth's Hyborian Era,<ref name=Bacon>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-06|last=Bacon|first=Thomas|title=Marvel Just Revealed The DARKEST Sorcerer Supreme|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-darkest-evil-sorcerer-supreme-kulan-gath/|access-date=2021-04-03|website=[[ScreenRant]]|language=en-US}}</ref> the ancient time period in which Conan the Barbarian lived. At some point, he marries the witch Vammatar in an alliance to obtain the power of the demon [[Shuma-Gorath]]. He has an apprentice named Razal Gulath, and is an enemy of the immortal vampire-like [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] named [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. In his first appearance, he seeks the power of the Melnibonéan sorceress Terhali, who had been exiled to Earth and placed in suspended animation; when Terhali awoke, she disintegrated Kulan Gath with a magical bolt of energy.

This proves to be only a setback for Kulan Gath, as he had achieved effective immortality by placing his life energy into a magical amulet. He eventually regains his body, allied with Vammatar, and fought Conan and [[Red Sonja]]. Kulan Gath and his bride were apparently destroyed when they attempted to control the demon [[Shuma-Gorath]]. Kulan Gath returned again in the miniseries ''Conan: The Flame and the Fiend'', thanks to the efforts of his new wife, Armati, but he was killed by Conan. At some point, his body was restored, but his heart was cut out by Red Sonja; a silhouetted scene in ''Marvel Saga'' No. 1 suggests that this may have occurred with the assistance of Conan.

===Modern adventures===
Millennia later, Kulan Gath returned to life in the modern world when the necklace that housed his essence turned up at a museum display in New York City. The necklace was donned by a night watchman; the sorcerer transformed the guard's body into a duplicate of his own, which he then possessed. He was defeated by Red Sonja, who had been temporarily reincarnated in the present day in the body of [[Mary Jane Watson]], and her newfound ally [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man later tossed the necklace off a ferry bound for Staten Island, but it was found not long afterwards by a fisherman named Jaime Rodriquez; although Jaime resisted Kulan Gath, a mugger who subsequently killed him was considerably weaker in willpower, and when the mugger donned the necklace, he was possessed instantly and transformed by the wizard.

Kulan Gath, now returned to the height of his power, transformed [[Manhattan]] into a likeness of his native time. Everyone trapped on the island believed that the transformed world was the true world, with the exceptions of his enemy Spider-Man and the modern-day Sorcerer Supreme, [[Doctor Strange]]. Kulan Gath mystically bound Strange, and he transformed [[Professor X]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] into a hybrid creature under his control. He also took control of the minds of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who hunted down Spider-Man. In the end, Spider-Man and several other heroes were killed by Kulan Gath, his enemy [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], or the mind-controlled agents of one of the two. Strange and the New Mutant [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] used their powers to change time so that the mugger who had originally killed Jaime Rodriquez and had been Kulan Gath's host had instead been slain by the time-travelling android [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], creating a new divergent timeline in which all the changes and deaths caused by Gath never occurred. In the process of the mugger's death, Kulan Gath's amulet was lost in the New York City sewers; Gath, however, still possessed the memories of the original timeline. In gratitude for saving his life, Jaime took Nimrod into his home, unaware of the Sentinel's true nature.

Yet another fisherman later found the amulet and was transformed into Kulan Gath's new host. Kulan Gath traveled to the Latin American nation of Costa Verde, and transformed the region inhabited by the fictional Kamekeri Native Americans as he had previously transformed Manhattan. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]- currently consisting of the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Iron Man]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Ms. Marvel|Warbird]], [[Henry Pym|Goliath]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Triathlon (comics)|Triathlon]], and accompanied by their ally [[Silverclaw]], traveled to Costa Verde to stop him. He attempted to sacrifice Silverclaw's mother, the Kamekeri goddess Pelali, to his demonic gods, but Silverclaw was able to free her (though Pelali died from the effects of the ritual later). The gods, having been partially summoned, still required a sacrifice, and when no other victim was offered, they took the unwilling Kulan Gath to their native dimension.

In the 2008 ''Spider-Man/Red Sonja'' mini-series, Gath was able to return to Earth when the amulet came into contact with a corrupt U.S. senator, providing him with a new body that he subsequently used to transform New York once again. Knowing that Red Sonja would return to fight him (once again possessing Mary Jane's body), Gath attempted to negate that threat by enchanting Sonja's blade so that she saw Spider-Man as an enemy. Fortunately, Sonja was eventually able to overcome the spell and fought alongside the wall-crawler, encouraged to trust him by Mary Jane's residual memories. Seeking to enhance his power, Gath attempted to lure [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] to him, subsequently stealing the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] and bonding with it to become "Kulan Venom", intending to then sacrifice Red Sonja and use her holy blood, blessed by a goddess, to complete his dominion over this plane and then expand to all others. Despite his attempts to delay his adversaries by pitting them against altered versions of [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], the symbiote's attempts to rejoin with Brock distracted Gath long enough for Sonja to destroy the amulet and break Gath's spell, thus restoring the world to normal.

In 2021 Kulan Gath was featured in the ''Savage Avengers'' storyline "The Defilement of all Things by the Cannibal-Sorcerer Kulan Gath.",<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-13|title=The X-Men Are Useless Against an Ancient Villain (and It's Not Apocalypse)|url=https://www.cbr.com/x-men-kulan-gath-defeats/|access-date=2021-10-29|website=CBR|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-10-06|title=Marvel Just Killed One of the Last Avengers You'd Ever Expect|url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-kills-savage-avenger-member-conan-barbarian/|access-date=2021-10-29|website=CBR|language=en-US}}</ref> where he is shown killing off most of the Marvel Universe's superheroes.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-14|title=Doctor Strange Learned Thanos Isn't Marvel's Most Terrifying Villain|url=https://screenrant.com/thanos-doctor-strange-kulan-gath-villain-marvel-comics/|access-date=2021-10-29|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Other versions==

===Exiles===
In ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #s 55-57, the Exiles visited an alternative universe where Kulan Gath's spell (from ''X-Men'' #s 189-191) was still active but controlled by [[Zarathos]]. At first, they were transformed by the spell, but were then freed by [[Illyana Rasputin]] and [[Spider-Man]], who were working with Kulan Gath. Eventually, after helping Gath fight Zarathos, [[Werewolf by Night]], [[Morbius (comics)|Morbius]] and others, [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] turns into Tanaraq and kills Gath, leaving [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] to undo the spell.

===Paradise X===
In ''[[Paradise X]]'', one of many alternate realities shown is a continuation of the original timeline in which Kulan Gath transformed Manhattan and killed Spider-Man. Gath went on to kill many other super-heroes and reverted the entire world back to a primitive age which he ruled over, turning the population into a barbarian army under his control. He had just executed [[Mr. Fantastic]], symbolizing his final triumph over the modern age of science and super-human heroes, when alternate universe versions of [[Machine Man|X-51]] and [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] arrived hoping to warn the people of that reality of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] seed in the Earth's core. When Gath stated that the Celestial seed was the source of his power, Hyperion killed him, allowing X-51 to pass on information to the people of that reality to help them save their world.

===Legenderry===
In ''Legenderry'', a [[Steampunk]] reality with versions of many Dynamite properties, Kulan Gath is an enemy of that setting's version of Red Sonja, and a member of a cult that seeks to control The City, In  ''Legenderry: Red Sonja'' v2, he has a son named D'Nar.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-07-01|title=In Review: Legenderry Red Sonja #4|url=https://www.scifipulse.net/in-review-legenderry-red-sonja-4/|access-date=2021-06-04|website=SciFiPulse.Net|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Reception ==
''[[Screen Rant]]'' reviewer Bryce Morris characterized Kulan Gath as a famed villain from the ''Conan the Barbarian'' series, as well as "one of the most powerful" and the "darkest sorcerer" in the world of Marvel Comics. Despite this, Morris judged that Kulan Gath "has not been a major player in the comics over the years" and has rarely received the same spotlight as other infamous magic users.<ref name=Morris/>

Morris' colleague Thomas Bacon labelled the character "the darkest [[Sorcerer Supreme]]" from the Marvel Comics, "a classic villain" and "a formidable foe" to other powerful players in their fictional universe. Bacon judged Kulan Gath's origin story "horrific, but loses a little of its shock value" because due to a lapse in the publication schedule some information on it was already disseminated beforehand.<ref name=Bacon/>

Comic book author Amy Chu stated in ''[[Kiss (comics)#Dynamite Entertainment|KISS]]'' in 2017 that in her view "Kulan Gath has been pretty much treated as a very one dimensional villain", focussing on his trait of megalomania. While she found "that's kind of fun", she planned to "develop him as a more complex character" with more differentiated goals in her run of ''Red Sonja''.<ref>{{cite journal |date=January 2017 |title=Amy Chu: From Hyrkania to the Big Apple |journal=[[Kiss (comics)|Kiss]] |volume=4 |pages=21 |publisher=[[Dynamite Entertainment|Dynamite]]}}</ref>

[[James Lowder]] commented critically about the use of the character in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #190/191: "As a spectacle, the Kulan Gath story worked well enough", with the evil wizard causing "blood-letting sadistic enough to sate fans of [[Grand Guignol]]-style entertainment". But Kulan Gath's strikingly depicted torture and murder of Spiderman and other characters in which readers were deeply invested, combined with the "cheat ending", where the sorcerer was defeated and all events erased by resetting the timeline, produced in Lowder's view a "profoundly unrewarding" tale.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lowder |first=James |author-link=James Lowder |editor-last1=Wein |editor-first1=Len |editor-link1=Len Wein |editor-last2=Wilson |editor-first2=Leah |date=2005 |title=The Unauthorized X-Men |location=Dallas, Texas |publisher=[[Benbella Books]] |chapter=Infinite Mutation, Eternal Stasis |pages=54–56 |isbn=1-932100-74-1}}</ref>
