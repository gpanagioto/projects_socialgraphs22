Well this sucks! You want something new every week, fatass. My fault?  Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman! Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that? Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go out and shop. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family. What's that?  What?  What's going on? What did he do?  Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop! Come on, this is ridiculous! Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel.  Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit cards to practically anyone who applies for them.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless ''until'' we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money. I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this. I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me.   Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith. There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now.  It's okay, Ma.   Aww, come on!}}
