Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house.  According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued. The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks.  The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside. We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house  showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards! I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest? So what are your plans, commander? Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander. For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out.  Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics? Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves. Yes. Huh? , proving that the people inside are not cultists after all.
