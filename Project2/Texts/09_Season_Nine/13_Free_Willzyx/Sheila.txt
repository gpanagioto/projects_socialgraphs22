 Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us? All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry.  Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though. I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico. Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.
