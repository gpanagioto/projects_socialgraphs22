 Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady! Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode! It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5! Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at? It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine.  Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready? Go below!  Stay calm! You have to stay calm!  No no, that's only if the boy gets off. Got it! I think! Up, up!
