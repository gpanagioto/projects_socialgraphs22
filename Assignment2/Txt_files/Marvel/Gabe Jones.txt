==Publication history==
Gabe Jones appeared as a regular cast-member in virtually every issue and annual of ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.'' In present-day stories, initially in the feature "[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]" in ''[[Strange Tales]]'', he appears as an agent of that fictional espionage organization &mdash; inexplicably aged very little, like fellow World War II vet and agent [[Dum Dum Dugan]], despite a [[retcon]] explanation for agency head [[Nick Fury]]'s youthfulness. As a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, Jones has appeared in issues of ''[[Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters (comic book)|Godzilla]]'', the first two volumes of ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and the 1988 miniseries ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.''

Although colorist Stan Goldberg knew that Jones was African American, the company that made the engraving plates for ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #1 thought a mistake had been made and colored him the same color as the rest of the Howling Commandos.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe |last=Lee |first=Stan |author2=Roy Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-4027-4225-5 |page = 54 }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Gabe Jones was born in [[New York City]]. He is an original member of the (fictional) elite Howling Commandos combat squad of World War II. The squad's senior officer [[Happy Sam Sawyer|Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer]] was given virtual carte blanche in choosing its members, including the [[African-American]] Jones, despite the fact that (at the time) integrated units were unheard of; The [[U.S. Armed Forces]] in real life were not integrated until 1948 by executive order of President [[Harry S. Truman]]. He is one of [[Nick Fury]]'s close confidantes, serving under his sergeant during the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]] in reunion missions and also joined the international espionage organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] at some unspecified point after the World War II.

During the war, the Howling Commandos travel to [[Wakanda]] to combat a Nazi invasion of that land. Jones helps out the ruling family by directly killing a Nazi agent who had taken one of the babies hostage.<ref>''Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers'' #3 (2010)</ref>

In 1959, he is shown working with [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and Fury, hunting down and executing Nazis.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #9 (February 2011)</ref> Later in the same year, Gabe assisted Fury and Dugan in creating the first team of Avengers. They successfully stopped a Nazi splinter group from gaining a version of the Super-Soldier formula.<ref name="New Avengers">''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #10 (May 2011)</ref>

Jones retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. sometime after, but returned to help train a new corps of recruits.<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' vol. 2 #7</ref> This new class is slain by the terrorist organization [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary nemesis.<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' vol. 2 #25</ref>
