I'll keep it at my house. What?! How dare you say that?! Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut. Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever! Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class.  O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history.  Yes? O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?  Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!  Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!
