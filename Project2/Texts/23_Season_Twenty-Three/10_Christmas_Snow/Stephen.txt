Yeah! Let's drive!   Mornin', Jim. Mornin', Kate. You really tied one one last night, huh? Happy holidays.  The fuck is this? But this is ridiculous.  Manager? Manager! Manager, there's a chain and sign blocking our way into the liquor aisle. What? Who has that kind of power? We drank it all before driving to the tree-lighting ceremony! Hey, woah woah woah, wait! Hold on!  I've got family coming over, from out of town! You can't expect me to be sober!  Skeeter! Thank God you're still open. I've me a Cabernet, huh? And a couple of bottles to take home. Oh what's the point, Jimbo? What's the point in driving now? We all do, Randy. You a-you're not gonna let a little cold weather stand in your way. Tegridy Farms is about community. I hate the holidays.  Oh wow, this smells great! Well, what are we waiting for, everyone? Let's do some driving!  And it's gonna be the best Christmas ever!  The hell is...? Did you do all my marijuana-free Christmas snow? What are you talking about? No!  Clearly you did! Thomas, we were just wondering if we could borrow a little Christmas Snow. You're darn tootin' we do! Well, only one thing left to do, gang. Let's go driving!
