'''Black Cat''' ('''Felicia Hardy''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Throughout her history, Black Cat has sometimes been an enemy, love interest, and ally of the superhero [[Spider-Man]].<ref name="ASM194"/>

Felicia Hardy is the daughter of [[Walter Hardy]], a world-renowned cat burglar. After suffering from a traumatic assault by an ex-boyfriend as a college freshman, she trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics and, after deciding to follow in her father's footsteps, adopted the costumed identity of the Black Cat.<ref>''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]''</ref> She has the subconscious ability to affect [[probability]] fields, producing "bad luck" for her enemies. The character was originally depicted as a [[supervillain]] and adversary of Spider-Man, but over time the two fell in love, which motivated her into becoming both an [[antihero]]ine, and his partner. However, their relationship grew complicated after it became apparent that Black Cat was only attracted to the [[alter ego]] of Spider-Man and had little interest in the hero's [[Secret identity|civilian life]] as Peter Parker. After their break-up, Black Cat maintained her role as one of Spider-Man's most trusted allies and for years the pair shared an [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-again, off-again]] romance. Following her introduction, Felicia Hardy has been labelled as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female antiheroes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Medina |first=Joshua |date=2022-06-03 |title=Marvel Anti-Heroes Who Should Make Their MCU Debut Soon |url=https://movieweb.com/mcu-marvel-antiheroes-debut/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=MovieWeb |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Polanco |first=Carlos E.

Being a part of his [[List of Spider-Man supporting characters|supporting cast]] and one of his principal love interests, Black Cat has been featured in many media adaptations related to Spider-Man, including animated series and video games. [[Felicity Jones]] played Felicia Hardy in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.

==Publication history==
[[File:BlkCatfh.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Black Cat from the ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' miniseries]]

In 1979, creator [[Marv Wolfman]] was looking for a female foil for [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. He decided to base a character on a [[Tex Avery]] cartoon, "[[Bad Luck Blackie]]", in which a black cat brought misfortune to anyone in close proximity.<ref name="cbulr22">{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-22/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #22!|website=CBR|date=October 27, 2005|accessdate=November 12, 2021}}</ref> The Black Cat's costume and appearance were designed by [[Dave Cockrum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002527565.cfm |title=Saying Goodbye to Dave Cockrum |access-date=June 21, 2007 |author=Matt Powell |date=November 27, 2006 |publisher=Wizard.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228085620/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002527565.cfm |archive-date=February 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=51}}</ref>

When Wolfman changed writing assignments within [[Marvel Comics]] to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', he brought his character with him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5550-5 |page=189}}</ref> He and Cockrum made considerable changes to the character and her appearance over this time; the Black Cat intended to debut in ''Spider-Woman'' had only her name and powers in common with the one who finally appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Dan |date=August 2006 |title=Marvel's Dark Angel: ''Back Issue'' Gets Caught in Spider-Woman's Web |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=17 |pages=57–63 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> On the bottom of the [[Letter to the editor|letters page]] of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194 (July 1979), a [[thumbnail]] of the intended cover for ''Spider-Woman'' #9 (December 1978) appears along with a rejected cover for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194. Wolfman said in an interview:<blockquote>I didn't plan Black Cat to be in Spidey. I created her for Spider-Woman (look at the letter column of the first B.C. story and you'll see). I then decided to leave Spider-Woman and moved her over. So, I never even thought of [[Catwoman]] when I did her. I got the idea for her from a [[Tex Avery]] cartoon, [[Bad Luck Blackie]]".<ref name="cbulr22" /> </blockquote>Black Cat's first comic book appearance was drawn by ''Amazing Spider-Man'''s (at that time) regular penciller [[Keith Pollard]].

Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] began writing the ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' miniseries in 2002. After the third issue the series went on a hiatus until 2005, when Smith revealed he had finally finished writing the scripts. Smith has stated, "While I have zero defense for my lateness (particularly when folks like [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis]] turn out great stories in multiple books on a monthly basis), I will say this: it's a much better story now than it would've been had I completed it back in '02."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=36769 |archive-url=https://archive.today/2012.07.30-095844/http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=36769 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 30, 2012 |title=The impossible has happened... |access-date=June 21, 2007 |author=Kevin (Presumably Kevin Smith) |date=July 28, 2005 |publisher=View Askew Message Board}}</ref>

In the mid-2000s, she starred alongside [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a limited comic book miniseries titled ''Claws''. A sequel to this miniseries, entitled ''Claws II'', began publication in July 2011. Black Cat was a lead character in the 2006–2007 ''Heroes for Hire'' series.

The ''Black Cat'' ongoing series written by Jed Mackay debuted in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/02/21/black-cat-2019-comic-series-marvel/|title=Marvel Announces 'Black Cat' Ongoing Series|access-date=June 26, 2019|last=Peters|first=Megan|date=February 22, 2019|website=comicbook.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814121606/https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/black-cat-2019-comic-series-marvel/|archive-date=August 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Spider194.png|thumb|''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #194 (July 1979): The Black Cat's debut. Cover art by [[Al Milgrom]].]]
Felicia Hardy was born in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Her father [[Walter Hardy|Walter]] pretended to be a traveling salesman but was a world-renowned cat burglar who, before his arrest, encouraged her to never settle for second best. If she loved [[basketball]], she should work to become a basketball player and not just a [[cheerleader]].

In ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]'', Black Cat herself reveals that as a freshman at Empire State University, she was raped by her boyfriend Ryan. Hating the idea of being a victim, she trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics, intent on killing him. Finally, after months of preparing, she set out for revenge, but before she could find him, Ryan was killed in a drunk driving accident. Furious that she was denied the chance for revenge, Hardy decided to utilize her new skills to follow in her father's footsteps. After amassing a fortune in stolen items, Felicia adopted her costumed identity.

She first dons the Black Cat costume in order to break her father out of prison. On the same night, she meets Spider-Man. Her father dies, and she then fakes her own death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194–195</ref> Despite her antipathy towards men, Felicia feels a kinship with this lone hero; Spider-Man is the first man she felt she could trust and she grows to believe herself in love with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #204–205</ref> Felicia looks for a way to earn his trust and continues with the Black Cat persona as a misguided attempt to attract his affection. Seeing the good in Felicia, Spider-Man makes every attempt to have her criminal record expunged.

Felicia is placed in a mental institution but escapes. She joins forces with Spider-Man against the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. She is granted conditional amnesty, and again convinces Spider-Man that she has died.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #226–227. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Black Cat finally finds the opportunity to prove herself after learning the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] controls an incredibly powerful detonator. The [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] plans to use the weapon to hold New York City hostage. Meanwhile, [[Doctor Octopus]] plans to use the weapon to destroy the city altogether. However, the Black Cat uses her abilities to steal the item first and protect it from all parties. She gives the detonator to Spider-Man and becomes the target of Doctor Octopus' revenge. Although Spider-Man tears off his mechanical appendages, Octopus is still able to mentally control them and hold the Black Cat still while his men open fire. Spider-Man barely gets her to the hospital in time and as they operate on the dozens of bullet and knife wounds, Peter realizes just how much he cares for Felicia.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #74–76. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After she recovers, they begin a relationship and soon Peter reveals his identity to her. Felicia has difficulty accepting the fact that Peter is just a man beneath the mask and cannot understand his need for a civilian life. Peter is hurt, but continues the relationship since it was the first time he did not need to hide his life as Spider-Man from someone.

Initially, the "accidents" which seem to befall those who crossed the Black Cat's path are merely well-planned stunts and traps. After her near-death experience,<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #75</ref> Felicia fears her lack of superpowers make her a liability to Spider-Man. She is terrified that his overwhelming need to protect her will eventually get him killed, so Felicia seeks a way to make herself Spider-Man's equal. Felicia is offered an opportunity to undergo the same process that was used to create the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #87–89. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kingpin uses it on the Black Cat as payback for a theft she committed. Scared and ashamed of being empowered by the Kingpin of crime, she keeps her new abilities a secret from Peter. Her 'bad luck' power turns out to be infectious, and begins to jinx Spider-Man, which was exactly the Kingpin's intent. Feeling a wall of secrets growing between them, Spider-Man breaks up with Felicia.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref> Felicia then begins a "[[Robin Hood]] crusade", stealing from the rich to give to the poor.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #112. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Peter soon realizes something is amiss with his own luck and enlists the aid of [[Doctor Strange]] to remove the "hex" on him. By doing so, he alters the hex's source and changes the Black Cat's powers in the process. She finds she has heightened [[superhuman strength|strength]], agility, balance, vision, and retractable claws. While burglarizing the mercenary known as the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]], Black Cat is attacked by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], the Foreigner's hitman; Spider-Man saves her life.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Black Cat updates her look and her attitude and rekindles her relationship with Spider-Man. She makes peace with his need for a normal life as Peter Parker and stands by him while he is accused of murder as Spider-Man. Together, they track down the source of the elaborate scheme to frame him and fight the Foreigner.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #115–117. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her apartment is fire-bombed by the Foreigner's hitman Blaze, and she begins living with Peter Parker.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #123–124. Marvel Comics.</ref> Peter later discovers their relationship is just a ruse against him, and that she had secretly been in a relationship with The Foreigner. However, despite her anger during her ruse, Felicia begins to fall back onto her desire to love Peter. Spider-Man comes home to discover Black Cat discussing her plans to ruin his life by framing him for murder, during a telephone-conversation with The Foreigner. Before he can catch her, she escapes. Spider-Man tracks her down to the Foreigner's apartment by attempting to trick Lt. Keating into revealing evidence as Peter Parker. Peter then intercepts a phone-call on Keating's phone, which turns out to be Felicia, telling Keating to meet her. However this is a part of her plan, as she intentionally lured Spider-Man into finding her at the Foreigner's apartment, causing a fight to ensue between The Foreigner and Spider-Man. Later she clears Spider-Man of his murder charge. In the end, the Black Cat double-crosses the Foreigner and Spider-Man, detailing her plan and her feelings towards Peter in a letter, also explaining that she has fled to Paris in order to start a new-life.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #128–129. Marvel Comics.</ref> This pushes Peter to find support and a new relationship with [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #290–293. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years later, the Black Cat returns to America, and goes "shopping" (actually [[shoplifting]]) with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2 #10.

As she battles against Electro and Spider-Man deals with Black Cat, J. Jonah Jameson remains on the channel forcing the cameraman to film the action. Spider-Man tries to convince Black Cat to stop even while she does not believe his story of being mind-swapped. Black Cat deviates one of Electro's bolts, hitting Spider-Man and knocking him down in the process. Black Cat attempts to unmask Spider-Man as Jameson aims the camera,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #5.

In the Slide-Away Casino, [[Melter]] and [[Killer Shrike]] take [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] to the back room where Black Cat is waiting. Black Cat shows him various items and tells him that even she cannot steal everything and sometimes must pay for them and asks him how is she supposed to do that when nobodies like him do not pay her weekly cut. Ringer tells her he did not pay because he was captured by Silk, owed the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] for getting him out of jail, and had to pay the [[Tinkerer]] for new equipment. He also tells Black Cat they worked in some works before and remembers her having a heart and asks for compassion. Black Cat hesitates long enough for the Ringer to attack them, hitting her in her arm before she takes him down. Black Cat tells Ringer that he will make three times the cut and will also serve as an example by having Killer Shrike and Melter beat him up. Black Cat is surprised Ringer could tag her as she normally is more lucky. She wonder if it was luck to remind her of who she is now and tests her luck with one of the casino's machines and wins. Black Cat notices that lately the harder she listens to the part of her that tells her not to let anyone put her down, the more her luck gets off the charts. She remembers her life in the elite class before she lost it all. Melter and Killer Shriek bring in Ringer and Black Cat tells him to spread the word that no one steals from her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> Two years ago, Felicia Hardy presents a painting in an elite party. In the present day at a museum, Regina Venderkamp, the woman who bought all the items confiscated from the Black Cat in an auction, presents the same painting that Felicia did. However, the lights go out for a moment and the painting is gone. An enraged Regina and her bodyguards go to her apartment only to find all of her treasures gone. She goes upstairs to see if she also took everything there, despite a bodyguard protesting since Black Cat could still be there. Black Cat then appears and says she couldn't leave without Regina learning that no one takes from Black Cat without paying. Regina orders her bodyguards to attack, but Black Cat quickly takes them out. She reflects that her bad luck powers seem to work better when she is ruthless and she may have been holding back before. Black Cat throws one of her claws to Regina's neck causing her to pass out. Hours later, Regina wakes up handcuffed to a chair at Black Cat's hideout. Black Cat contemplates almost all of the items that were confiscated and those she retrieved with only one missing. In J. Jonah Jameson Sr. and Aunt May's apartment, they contemplate the last item the only thing they got at the auction and go watch TV unaware that the Black Cat plans to steal it back.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following Spider-Man's fight with [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] at [[Parker Industries]], Black Cat places the statue with the rest of her things while having Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina Venderkamp tied up. Jay asks her why did she took them as she doesn't need money and they didn't do nothing to her. Felicia pours gasoline around her apartment and tells Jay he is wrong as they bought her things in the auction, a collection she spent years acquiring. She tells him that's the problem with possessions, they can break, you can lose them or they can be taken. And when that happens, everyone thinks they can take what's yours unless you prove them wrong. She says that nothing and no one will have that hold on him before setting the apartment on fire. When Spider-Man arrives, May warns him that the Black Cat is still in there and Peter asks Felicia for help. She tells him to save them if he wants as she made her point and the more people know the better. Parker tries to convince her that this isn't her but she tells him that the Felicia he knew is gone and she is done being who others want. She tells her that she controls her fate and anyone who stands before that will also be gone. Spider-Man manages to save Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina, who screams at him for not saving her things before May shushes her, telling her that people are what count, not things and Spider-Man knows that. In the Slide-A-Way Casino, Black Cat tells her men that they have seen what happens when they stay on her good side and what happens when they cross her. But from now on, there's nothing holding her back and no limit to what she will do.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Fresh Start===
During Marvel's "[[Fresh Start (comics)|Fresh Start]]", Black Cat teamed up with Spider-Man to confront the Thieves Guild, a group of robbers established hundreds of years ago that was trying to make their name known again by stealing the equipment of various super heroes. As an honorary member of the Guild, she was able to allow the two to break in and fight off Guild members until the rest of the heroes showed up to reclaim their items. Later that night, Felicia tells Spider-Man that her darker mentality didn't start when Doctor Octopus arrested her, but instead when she forgot Spider-Man's secret identity as a result of Doctor Strange making everyone forget it after a ''Civil War'', feeling that she lost a significant part of her life in the process. In response, Peter takes off his mask and reveals his secret to Felicia, which she gladly accepts. Afterwards, Kindred ([[Harry Osborn]]) learns of Spider-Man's rekindled friendship with Black Cat and claims that Peter "drags everyone into his own Hell".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol 5. #9–10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Last Remains]]" storyline, Black Cat gets her hands on the Hand of the Vishanti and makes a 3D replica of it. This attracts the attention of Doctor Strange who wants it back.

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, the Black Cat had no [[superhuman]] abilities. Later, a test induced by the Kingpin gave her the psionic ability to affect [[probability]] fields; essentially, she could produce "bad luck" for her enemies.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #89</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Isaak |first=Joshua |date=2022-07-07 |title=Marvel Uses Black Cat To Create Its Own Mission: Impossible |url=https://screenrant.com/black-cat-iron-man-iron-cat-teamup-marvel/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US |quote=Although she was introduced as an enemy without any powers, the Kingpin changed her and granted her the unconscious power to affect probability fields}}</ref> The "bad luck" power entails that under stress she is subconsciously able to cause anyone in her immediate vicinity that she perceives as a threat to be susceptible to freak accidents, like guns jamming and exploding, or tripping on objects. This ability also had the [[side effect]] of eventually causing problems for anyone spending long periods of time around her.

[[Doctor Strange]] eventually tampered with her powers that briefly removed her bad luck abilities, along with the unwanted side effect. However, this magical tampering temporarily endowed her with cat-like abilities, giving her [[night vision]], retractable talons in her fingertips, superhuman speed, strength, agility and endurance, proportionate to a cat.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #116. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' Vol 2 #11.

The Black Cat has reflexes, agility, and stamina of an Olympic level acrobat.

Hardy is a talented photographer; while dating Spider-Man she takes pictures of the hero that he admits are better than his own work.{{issue|date=March 2018}}

The Black Cat has also acquired several devices from the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] that increase her agility and heighten her strength.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> She wears earrings that interact with the balance centers of her brain to grant her enhanced agility. She has contact lenses that let her see in various ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]. Her costume contains micro-[[Servomechanism|servos]] that enhance her strength above normal human levels. The gloves of her costume contain steel micro-filaments, which form retractable claws at the fingertips when she flexes her fingers (triggering a magnetic surge which condenses the filaments into polarized talons) which enable her to tear through most surfaces and easily scale walls. Using this equipment, the Black Cat has been able to beat enemies who have superhuman abilities.

The Black Cat has a miniature grappling hook device hidden in the "fur" of each glove, designed by her father [[Walter Hardy]] which enables her to swing from buildings in a manner similar to Spider-Man, though not quite as fast. She can also use the cable from this device as a tightrope, wall scaling device, swing line, or as a weapon in combat.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Indigo |first=Xan |date=2022-04-11 |title=Spider-Man 4 Needs To Introduce Black Cat As An MCU Antihero |url=https://screenrant.com/spiderman-4-black-cat-mcu-antihero-first/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Liam McGuire of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' referred to Black Cat as a "fan-favorite figure in the comics," writing, "The character has become an A-list character in the comics, as her costume, personality, and playfulness - all displayed in the piece - have captured the attention of readers and turned Black Cat into an antihero they are thrilled to see pop up in stories."<ref>{{Cite web |last=McGuire |first=Liam |date=2022-05-16 |title=Marvel’s Black Cat Shows Being Bad Is More Fun In Gorgeous Fan Art |url=https://screenrant.com/black-cat-gorgeous-fan-art-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-08-23 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Elliot Swan of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called Black Cat "interesting and complex," saying, "She has proven herself as a hero worthy of the chance to develop outside the web of Spider-Man and has developed beyond being a footnote in the life of Marvel's iconic web-slinger. [...] Jed Mackay has been instrumental in igniting a new era of passionate fanfare for Black Cat, and she is very deserving of the acclaim.

However, she eventually proved that she possesses a moral fiber, which resulted in Felicia becoming an ally against evil and on-again-off-again romantic interest for Spidey (in a dynamic that one could argue too closely mirrors DC’s Batman and Catwoman).

She’s a bluntly sexual character who is also hilarious. She doesn’t have to be a man to crack a joke about body parts or to banter with Spider-Man about the Green Goblin’s latest hair cut. Her willingness to be sexually appealing doesn’t mean she can’t snort when she laughs.

Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' asserted, "Spider-Man doesn't have a lot of iconic female villains (Peter Parker isn't the type to punch a girl if he can help it), but he does have Black Cat. Black Cat is similar to Catwoman, both in the sense that she's a skilled thief who dresses with a cat motif and because she has a complicated and sometimes romantic relationship with Spidey. That's not to say Felicia Hardy is a carbon copy of Selina Kyle. She's a complex character who looks out mostly for herself and struggles to move forward from a rough youth."<ref>{{Cite web |first=Jesse |last=Schedeen |date=2014-08-05 |title=Spider-Man: Which female character will get her own movie? |url=https://in.ign.com/the-amazing-spider-man-3/61578/feature/spider-man-which-female-character-will-get-her-own-movie |access-date=2022-08-23 |website=IGN India |language=en-in}}</ref> Eric Diaz of ''[[Nerdist]]'' wrote, "Although initially created as a Catwoman-like, sexy cat burglar villain for Spider-Man to fight back in 1979, much like her DC counterpart, Felicia Hardy had a soft spot for the hero she battled the most. Eventually, Felicia got romantically involved with Spidey, and she learned his true identity long before his main squeeze Mary Jane ever did.

They both have “cat” in their name. And they both enjoy a will-they-won’t-they relationship with an urban male superhero — Batman and Spider-Man, respectively — who feels conflicted about dating them because of their illegal activities. But the unlikely truth is that all of those similarities are pure coincidence — or maybe just Felicia Hardy’s bad luck to be created second [...] Stories of deliberate ripoffs and open inspiration are so common in the comics world that nobody could be faulted for thinking there was some funny business going on in Black Cat’s creation. But what actually happened is even more interesting.

Anthony Orlando of ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' said, "Now that Peter and MJ have officially separated, now is the perfect time for him to meet the Black Cat. Born Felicia Hardy, this cat burglar became Spider-Man's partner/girlfriend, and she has repeatedly fought alongside him over the years, making her increasingly popular with fans. Though she may seem like a copycat of Catwoman, Hardy is still a fascinating and complex character all her own, and she could provide much-needed support to Spider-Man in his new, lonely life."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Orlando |first=Anthony |title=12 Spider-Man Characters Sony Should Introduce After "Morbius" |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/spidey-characters-to-introduce |access-date=2022-08-23 |website=BuzzFeed |language=en}}</ref> Joshua Medina of ''[[MovieWeb]]'' stated, "With Tom Holland's Spider-Man having fantastic success in the MCU and possibly getting a second trilogy of movies, fans can only hope to see the stunning and cunning Black Cat in action.

By that, I mean her time in the live-action world. With three separate movie franchises built around Peter Parker, you’d think that we’d have more of her in our films. Instead, we have Felicity Jones in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and … that’s pretty much it. (Granted, we were supposed to have her in one of the Raimi films, but alas.) So now, with a plethora of rumors surrounding the Spider-Verse (like the fact that we could be getting a show led by Silk and the Olivia Wilde movie heading our way) and who we’re going to get in the live-action form, my pitch is for a Black Cat anything Whether it’s just in the Tom Holland movies or in a franchise all her own, Felicia Hardy deserves her time."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-09-07 |title=Give Black Cat Her Live-Action Due |url=https://www.themarysue.com/give-black-cat-time/ |access-date=2022-08-23 |website=The Mary Sue |language=en}}</ref> Nahila Bonfiglio of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' asserted, "One of the things that many viewers love about the current iteration of Spider-Man is his charming innocence, something that doesn’t mesh well with a character like Black Cat. While every iteration of Peter Parker arries some degree of good-natured naiveté, at his current age, he’s better equipped to handle adversaries who don’t utilize their sex appeal. In the future, however, Black Cat would make a welcome addition to the MCU, as a cameo or full movie. Fans of the comics and films alike would love to see Peter Parker mature, and the inclusion of such an engaging, complicated antiheroine would no doubt delight viewers. We don’t know if it will ever happen, but here’s hoping the future sees plenty more Black Cat on the big—and small—screen."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bonfiglio |first=Nahila |date=2019-07-14 |title=Will the Black Cat movie ever happen? |url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/spider-man-movies-black-cat/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=The Daily Dot |language=en-US}}</ref>

Craig Lines of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' stated, "The tone of Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray’s script, although quite violent, is very much classic romantic adventure, with Wolverine and Black Cat trading flirtatious banter and saucy body language as they splat bad dudes. It’s the sort of naughty comedy-action romp that Kevin Smith started and should’ve finished with his failed ''The Evil That Men Do'' mini-series (as opposed to the jumbled, misogynistic angst-fest it became). Whilst not exactly challenging, there are some good laughs and even a touch of suspense. In addition to zippy writing, the artwork is also consistently nice. I liked Joe Linsner’s interpretation of the Black Cat costume and, having seen her drawn so atrociously in recent years (come on down, Clayton Crain), ''Claws'' scores points on that front alone. On the down side, the mini-series is maybe an issue too short and I personally felt it lost its pace a little in Issue Three with an extended (and utterly unnecessary) flashback sequence, but otherwise, ''Claws'' is a sharp little critter and well worth getting your paws on."<ref>{{Cite web |last=jbindeck2015 |date=2007-09-13 |title=Claws review |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/books/claws-review/ |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=Den of Geek |language=en-US}}</ref> Kirsten Murray of ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked the ''Claws'' comic book series 5th in their "10 Greatest Black Cat Stories Ever" list, saying, "An unlikely duo teamed up in three-part miniseries, ''Claws''.

If the pair make it to a boat waiting to take them to their rescue on the other side of the island, they can go free. However, they have to evade the huntsmen. An action-packed adventure ensues, with Wolverine and Black Cat working together effectively as they dodge bullets, rockets, and even killer robots.

According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Claws'' #1 was the 130th best selling comic book in July 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: July 2011 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2011/2011-07.html |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 300 Comics Actual--July 2011 |url=https://icv2.com/articles/comics/view/20795/top-300-comics-actual-july-2011 |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=icv2.com |language=en}}</ref>

Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Wolverine & Black Cat: Claws'' #1 a grade of 6.5 out of 10, asserting, "Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray offer up another rollicking adventure that's heavy on action and laughs and light on anything resembling substance. There's really no deep connection to exploit between the title heroes, so this story plays out like another take on the Wolverine/Domino dynamic from X-Force: Sex + Violence. It would have been nice to see the writers throw a new batch of villains into the mix rather than Arcade and White Rabbit. The humor also borders on being too silly and simplistic at times, such as the scene where a villain crashes into a hot dog cart and elicits a stereotypical New Yorker reaction from those around him. Again, the story is good, dumb fun, but too heavy on the dumb at times. In any case, the main appeal with either volume of ''Claws'' lies in seeing Joseph Linsner try his hand at Marvel's stable. For the most part, that's enough to sell the book. Linsner's work is sexy, playful, and dynamic - an all-around perfect fit for the script. Sure, his Wolverine is some bizarre amalgamation of hairless ape and furry were-beast, but at least he's back to being short and ugly. Lighthearted romps are all good and well. Where ''Claws'' ''II'' will find its greatest challenge is in competing with books like ''Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine''. That series has proven a comic can offer simple, unfettered fun and still rank as one of the best of the year. ''Claws'' can't get by with coasting on the bare minimum."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2011-07-07 |title=Wolverine & Black Cat: Claws Vol. 2 #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/07/wolverine-black-cat-claws-vol-2-1-review |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>

Sam Stone of ''[[CBR.com]]'' compared ''Black Cat'' #1 to ''[[Ocean's 11]]'' and ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', writing, "Fun, true to the character, and action-packed, the inaugural issue of ''Black Cat'' is a top-down joy to read both for longtime fans of the character while being completely accessible to new readers. The creative team seamlessly mixes genres and explores the possibilities of the character without shying away from Felicia Hardy's recent villainous history. Reestablishing the character as a cool, confident burglar with her own checkered past, ''Black Cat'' #1 sets the stage for a heist-oriented adventure in the heart of the Marvel Universe for its eponymous protagonist."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stone |first=Sam |date=2019-06-20 |title=REVIEW: Black Cat #1 Effortlessly Blends Heist Thrills & Superhero Action |url=https://www.cbr.com/review-black-cat-1/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Charlie Ridgely of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' called ''Black Cat'' #1 a "surprisingly enjoyable read," saying, "''Black Cat'' #1 is a simple and grounded, but exciting series that gives an underutilized character the chance to shine on her own.

Charlie Ridgely of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''Black Cat'' #2 a grade of 4 out of 5, asserting, "Color me surprised once again, but Black Cat is a good book. It's a caper-heist comic that continues to be better than you'd think it has any right to be, turning a supporting character like Felicia Hardy into an effortlessly compelling leading force. It's almost impossible not to be captured by her, as well as the characters around her. Everything at work in this book was already great, but adding in a crazed Merlin and a trip to the Sanctum Santorum make it even better. It's time to add this one to your pull list."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 7/10/2019 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/new-comic-reviews-dc-marvel-image-279492/ |access-date=2022-09-05 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref>

Sam Stone of ''[[CBR.com]]'' described ''Black Cat'' #1 as a "solid relaunch," stating, "MacKay and Villa reunite to take springboard Black Cat's latest comic off the back of "King in Black", staying true to the spirit of the character and their previous series while managing to complement the bombastic crossover event. MacKay and Villa succeed in making this opening issue feel more like a tie-in to the crossover's story than several of the previous issues bearing the "King in Black" tie-in banner. Despite the new #1, Black Cat's relaunch keeps very much in line with what came before it while inviting new readers to jump on for a thrill ride as Felicia rises as the Marvel Universe's unlikely greatest savior."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stone |first=Sam |date=2020-12-16 |title=REVIEW: Black Cat Jumps Into a Solid Relaunch Against the King in Black |url=https://www.cbr.com/black-cat-king-in-black-1-review/ |access-date=2022-09-01 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Tanner Dedmon of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' called ''Black Cat'' #1 an "excellent jumping-on point," asserting, "Black Cat also has a surprisingly reserved presence in her own debut issue, but that's again owed to everything occurring around her. Seeing Black Cat slay symbiote dragons might have been memorable, but considering how other heroes have performed against similar threats, it never would've been believable. As such, Black Cat sometimes gets overshadowed during the more explosive moments of ''Black Cat'' #1. That type of action was never her game anyway—"above my pay grade," she says at one point in the issue—so her sacrifice of the spotlight was a necessary one to set her up for an opportunity to do what she does best. Like Captain America's confidence imbued in her, Black Cat's resolve is infectious, easily carrying whatever comes next in her new series."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Black Cat #1 Review: This is a Heist for the Ages |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/black-cat-1-review-marvel-jed-mackay-knull/ |access-date=2022-09-01 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref>

Dustin Holland of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score'' #1 the "perfect ending for Black Cat and the [[Infinite Destinies]] Crossover," asserting, "''Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score'' #1 gives Felicia the heroic ending she deserves. The issue delivers a fun, action-packed story that addresses numerous characters and storylines without rushing anything. MacKay and Villa give Black Cat the opportunity to finish one of the most important jobs of her storied career. Felicia definitely still has some unfinished business, but this ending encapsulates the spirit of the ''Black Cat'' series perfectly."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Holland |first=Dustin |date=2021-12-08 |title=Marvel's Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score #1 Comic Review |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvels-giant-size-black-cat-infinity-score-1-comic-review/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Adam Barnhardt of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score'' #1 a grade of 4.5 out of 5, saying, "Jed MacKay's time with Black Cat has already been exceptional enough—then you factor in a stellar one-shot like Infinity Score, and it takes everything to a whole other level. Here, you have Felicia Hardy using half of the Infinity Stones for a relatively small purpose in the cosmic scheme of things—but it's an extremely personal and heartfelt reason as to why she does. And that's where MacKay often succeeds most: making these bombastic heroes as human as they can be. Hardy sets out to do her biggest score, regardless of the costs and she aces it, in more ways than one. As far as finales go, it's hard to imagine Infinity Score being a better endcap. For a street-level character that oftentimes aligns herself with the slimiest characters in the entire Marvel stable, ''Black Cat: Infinity Score'' #1 is packed to the brim with heart and a certain warmth that's perfect for the holiday season."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 12/8/2021 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/new-comic-reviews-dc-marvel-image-december-8-2021/ |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref>

Sayantan Gayen of ''[[CBR.com]]'' referred to ''Mary Jane & Black Cat: Beyond'' #1 as a "thrilling tale peppered with drama and intrigue," writing, "It is not an exaggeration to say that ''Mary Jane & Black Cat: Beyond'' #1 features one of the best Marvel crossovers in recent history. Jed MacKay writes an equally beautiful team-up of Black Cat and Ben Reilly in the ''Death of Doctor Strange: Spider-Man'' #1. Needless to say, MacKay has a good grasp on the character of Felicia Hardy and has found a seamless way to connect her with other characters across the Spider-Man mythos. Mary Jane and Black Cat may look at each other as romantic rivals, but the instant bonding between the two and the comfort they feel in each other's company is heartwarmingly beautiful to see.

I-J Wheaton of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Iron Cat'' #1 a "neon-tinted team-up comic," saying, "''Iron Cat'' #1 draws together many elements of the mythos that have been steadily building around Black Cat. It is very exciting to see a relative newcomer like Black Cat being pushed further into the mainstream with a team-up with a prominent Marvel character like Iron Man. With any luck, we'll see a whole new generation of readers checking out Black Cat and her previous solo comics.

In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] continuity, Black Cat is cybernetically enhanced. She was originally a simple thief, who stole a cursed magical amulet for its monetary value, but this act attracted the attention of [[Alternative versions of Daredevil#Marvel Mangaverse|Matt Murdock, the Devil Hunter]], and she was cut in half. The Kingpin of Crime reconstructed her body with cybernetics, including a shut-down mechanism he planned to activate if she failed to serve him. After completing her mission for the Kingpin, he claimed to have permanently deactivated the mechanism, but whether he kept his word or not remains to be seen. She is still [[Spider-Man]]'s old flame, but in the New Mangaverse storyline (with Spider-Man having chosen [[Mary Jane Watson]] over her) she is trying to move on, and is now showing a romantic interest in [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Mangaverse|Wolverine]] though by the end of the story arc it is clear that she has a hidden agenda as she is later seen with [[Nick Fury]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

In [[Marvel Noir]], Felicia Hardy is the owner of "The Black Cat", a speakeasy that caters to the most powerful and corrupt in New York City.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir #1''. Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes without a Face'', she takes on a more prominent role, sheltering Peter after he is almost killed by [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], as well as dating [[Crime Master]]. Like most incarnations, Felicia has a relationship with [[Spider-Man Noir]]. Crime Master slashes her when he finds out about this, but before passing out, she alerts the FBI that he is in league with [[Otto Octavius]] and his inhumane experiments. The final panel of the series shows her with a mask similar to [[Madame Masque]], angrily refusing to see Spider-Man since she blames him for her scars.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Mask Issues #1–4''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline, she was assaulted by Kingpin and his men in hopes of extracting the identity of Spider-Man, but with nothing to lose anymore she retains her silence. She was then used as a hostage to lure Spider-Man in accepting Mysterio's challenge. After the battle, she would secretly grab the blood of Spider-Man which was extracted earlier to avoid it falling into Mysterio's hands.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

She would later appear tending to an injured Spider-Man Noir (accompanied by Silk and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]) while on the run from the [[Spider-Verse|Inheritors]].{{issue|date=December 2014}}

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified Black Cat is briefly seen battling [[Iron Fist (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Iron Fist]]. He punches a hole straight through her.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

When asked about this during his Joe Friday 100, Joe Q explained that "the MZ world is not exactly like the regular Marvel Universe. Our Captain America is their "Colonel America". Their Reed Richards is evil. A lot of the costumes are from different eras in our world. We assumed it was obvious from the context that in the MZ world, Felicia Hardy has a twin sister, Felicity Hardy, who is the costumed adventurer known as Night Cat".<ref>[http://classic.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/JoeFridays100_2.html Joe Fridays – Week 100, A Weekly Q&A With Joe Quesada, Part 2]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Newsarama]]</ref>

She uses her new powers for heists, constantly getting the best of her friend Detective Jean DeWolff. She eventually gives herself up to Jean as her powers have made stealing too easy and has taken away the thrill of it. Before she is arrested, Anya Corazon arrives on Earth-194 requests her help in stopping a threat that endangers the Spider-Verse, which she accepts due to the scope of the challenge.<ref>''Edge of Spider-Verse Vol. 2 #3''.

The Cat Lady hired private investigator Howard the Human to find a spy within her organization, but someone was able to find him before Howard and killed him. The Cat Lady then gave Howard twelve hours to find the assassin. Otherwise, she would kill him. Howard figured out that the informant was playing possum on orders from a simian version of Wilson Fisk who wanted to take his main rival the Cat Lady down. She confronts him and Adrian Toomes at a bar but they are both arrested as Howard planned. Howard kept the informant Peter Possum alive to get the reward money from the district attorney and to have Peter testify against Felecia.<ref>''Howard the Human'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===
Felicia Hardy makes her appearance in issue #17 of the series. She is a teenager who transfers to the same high school attended by Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. Felicia is considered "bad luck" due to her violent past and confrontational personality. She flirts with Flash and challenges his girlfriend, [[Liz Allan]], to a fight, which was merely a ruse to establish her reputation as a girl not to be messed with.<ref>''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Supernaturals===
A different version of Felicia Hardy is part of a team led by [[Brother Voodoo]]. Unlike her 616 counterpart, this version of Black Cat possesses enchanted vocal abilities that allow her to alter the outcomes of events by speaking certain phrases aloud (for example, at one point, saying "Break" causes a noose to snap). This ability is shown to be useless once [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] tapes Felicia's mouth shut.<ref>''The Supernaturals'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Cole |date=2022-05-30 |title=10 Best Versions Of Black Cat From Marvel Comics, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/best-versions-black-cat-marvel-comics-ranked/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Black Cat (Ultimate Marvel character).jpg|upright|thumb|Ultimate Black Cat on the cover to ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #152 (November 2005). Art by [[Jeff Scott Campbell]].]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the Black Cat is Felicia Hardy, a young woman who blames her father's death on [[Kingpin (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin]].In this version, the Black Cat actually has short brunette hair and wears a white-haired wig as part of her costume. Seeking revenge, she stole a priceless tablet that he was going to use on his comatose wife. Kingpin hired the assassin [[Elektra (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Elektra]] to retrieve it. When Black Cat threw it into the harbor, Elektra threw one of her [[sai (weapon)|sai]] into the Black Cat's chest, sending the thief over the edge. She was presumed dead, though no body was found.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She later returned during a gang war, stopping [[Hammerhead (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Hammerhead]] from shooting [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] in the right temple.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #81. Marvel Comics.</ref> She later expressed interest in working for Hammerhead if it would mean getting rid of the Kingpin although Spider-Man opposed this.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #82. Marvel Comics.</ref> She later assisted Hammerhead and Elektra in a confrontation against Moon Knight, Shang-Chi, Iron Fist, and Spider-Man.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #84. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, after the crisis was resolved, she passionately kissed Spider-Man through his mask, her previous interest in him having gotten stronger. She had apparently no idea of the age disparity between her and Peter, and mistakenly assumed, after he left in a rush, that he was a married man. When she managed to unmask him and realized how young he truly was, she was repulsed. The shock and embarrassment of such a discovery caused her to vomit on his costume.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #85. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is next seen trying to assassinate the Kingpin. However, [[Mysterio]] beats her to it.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #153. Marvel Comics.</ref> She then tries to steal the Zodiac Key from the Kingpin's vault. Mysterio, knowing that it contained great power, tried to steal it from her. Felicia tried to wish Mysterio to go away, but instead she accidentally caused the key to create a massive explosion. Shocked by what she did, she handed it over to Mysterio. Spider-Man came to the scene with [[Iron Man]]. Mysterio subdued Iron Man and then Spider-Man, Mysterio, and Felicia then fought over the key. Spider-Man won and then both he and Felicia decided to help the people who were caught in the middle of Felicia's mistake.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #152–154. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===What If?===
Black Cat was featured in two ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' storylines:

* In ''What if the Alien Costume had Possessed Spider-Man?'', after the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] forms a permanent bond with Spider-Man due to [[Mister Fantastic]] being unable to examine the web-slinger until it is too late to break them apart, Felicia goes on a brief crime spree until she learns that the symbiote—which here lives on adrenaline from superhumans—has abandoned the now-deceased Spider-Man in favor of the [[Hulk]]; she favors killing the Hulk over the objections of the other heroes. After Spider-Man's funeral, she is contacted by the Kingpin, who helps her develop a weapon that will kill the symbiote in exchange for a lifetime of service from her; despite the heroes having already defeated the symbiote thanks to the actions of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Black Bolt]], with [[Doctor Strange]] being about to banish it, Felicia kills the symbiote anyway, subsequently berating the heroes for not knowing the price she had to pay to ensure that justice was done.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

* In another storyline, Spider-Man marries the Black Cat rather than Mary Jane – [[Alistair Smythe]]'s attack having left Mary Jane injured in this reality, leaving Peter doubting his ability to look after her, with he and Felicia rekindling their romance while fighting supervillains together, but their relationship is complicated by such factors as Peter and Felicia being unable to live together in order to preserve his secret identity. After Felicia's carelessness results in Spider-Man's identity being discovered by an unidentified informant, combined with her own jealousy over Peter's continued friendship with Mary Jane, she is killed by [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] after he mistakenly assumes she attempted to kill Mary Jane, resulting in Peter forming a romantic relationship with [[Silver Sable]] as the two bond over their shared grief at the loss of their loved ones.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #20–21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Additionally, she comes from a wealthy background as her mother is the head of the lucrative Hardy Foundation. Her father, [[Walter Hardy|John Hardesky]], was tricked by the Nazis into sneaking into an American lab during [[World War II]] to memorize the super-soldier formula behind [[Captain America]] and report back to the [[Red Skull]]. At the last moment, Hardesky realized the deception and ran away to a life of crime. In the present, he was held in a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] prison before the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] breaks him out. On Kingpin's behalf, [[Doctor Octopus]] kidnaps Felicia as leverage and to use her as a guinea pig for an improved super-soldier formula as Wilson Fisk introduces Felicia to the father that she never knew. It proves a success, enhancing her overall physical prowess and granting her the ability to transform between her normal blonde form and her empowered white haired form at will. Using her new power, she recruits Spider-Man to help her rescue her father and destroy the super-soldier formula. After Morbius turns himself into a vampiric entity, Felicia grapples with her feelings for him while trying to stop him. Along the way, she joins forces with Spider-Man, Morbius, and the vampire slayer [[Blade (character)|Blade]] to stop the Vampire Queen from creating an army of vampires. Following this, Felicia leaves New York to work with Blade and Morbius, though she returns to help Spider-Man defeat [[Hydro-Man]] and attend Peter and Mary Jane's wedding. In the three-part episode "[[Secret Wars]]", Spider-Man pulls Felicia away from a mission with Blade and Morbius to help him and a group of superheroes combat a group of supervillains assembled by the [[Beyonder]]. Once the battle is over, she is returned to the moment she was pulled from with no memory of what happened.
* Black Cat appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Tricia Helfer]].<ref name="btva" /> This version is depicted as a thief with no probability-based abilities, and frequently flirts with Spider-Man.

===Film===
* Black Cat appeared in early scripts for the live-action film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' as part of a subplot in which she tries to convince [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Spider-Man]] to give up being Peter Parker. This idea was to contrast with the other subplot of Peter giving up being Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/movie-legends-revealed-did-doc-ock-and-mary-jane-nearly-date-in-spider-man-2/ |title=Movie Legends Revealed: Did Doc Ock and Mary Jane Nearly Date in 'Spider-Man 2'? |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=May 4, 2016}}</ref> Though she was removed in later scripts, the Black Cat and her subplot are used in the video game based on the film. Felicia Hardy was then originally supposed to appear in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man 4]]'' as a secondary love interest of Parker's, though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat, as in the comics. Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new super-powered figure called the '''Vulturess'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieline.com/2009/12/exclusive-spider-man-4-circling-john-malkovich-anne-hathaway.php?page=all |title=EXCLUSIVE: Spider-Man 4 Circling John Malkovich, Anne Hathaway |publisher=MoveLine |date=December 8, 2009 |access-date=December 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213005246/http://www.movieline.com/2009/12/exclusive-spider-man-4-circling-john-malkovich-anne-hathaway.php?page=all |archive-date=December 13, 2009 }}</ref> In March 2013, Raimi stated that [[Anne Hathaway]] would have played Black Cat if ''Spider-Man 4'' had been made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/175363-sam-raimi-confirms-that-anne-hathaway-would-have-been-his-black-cat-in-spider-man-4 |title=Sam Raimi Confirms That Anne Hathaway Would Have Been His Black Cat in Spider-Man 4 |publisher=SuperHeroHype.com |date=March 5, 2013}}</ref>

It was intended to be a part of a [[shared universe]] called [[Sony's Spider-Man Universe]], which is centered on characters from the ''Spider-Man'' mythology and began with the live-action film ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' in 2018.

At the end of the game, Black Cat calls Venom and [[Captain America]] to help rescue Spider-Man from Doctor Octopus' self-destructing base.
* Black Cat appears as a supporting character in the main console version of the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (2004 video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' film tie-in game, voiced by [[Holly Fields]].<ref name="btva" /> Similarly to the comics, this version is a master thief who develops an interest in Spider-Man. She steals an artifact from a museum and attempts to escape, but Spider-Man gives chase. After he catches up with her, he persuades her to return the artifact and the two of them eventually become close allies; working together to stop various crimes over the course of their subsequent meetings. Throughout the game, Black Cat tries to persuade Spider-Man to "ditch" his normal life for a permanent life as Spider-Man. While she is ultimately unsuccessful, she understands his decision.
* Black Cat appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Audrey Wasilewski]].<ref name="btva" /> She joins [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to help stop the P.H.A.N.T.O.M. invasion shortly before Spider-Man was sent to investigate the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s' presence in [[Tokyo]]. There, Spider-Man encounters Black Cat trying to break into Doctor Octopus' lab and persuades her to join his team.
* Black Cat appears as a boss and assist character in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced again by [[Tricia Helfer]] in the [[Microsoft]], [[PlayStation]], [[Wii]], and [[Xbox]] versions and by Valerie Arem in the [[Nintendo DS]] version.<ref name="btva" /> After Spider-Man sees her leaving Fisk Tower, he assumes she is working for the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and gives chase. Following her defeat, Black Cat reveals that she is actually a [[double agent]] trying to thwart the Kingpin's illegal activities in an attempt to impress Spider-Man, for whom she still has feelings. The player is then presented with the choice of rejecting or returning her feelings; if the latter choice is made, Spider-Man will work with Black Cat against the Kingpin. Regardless of the choice made, Black Cat will become an ally. Later in the game, amidst a [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] invasion, Black Cat gets infected by one of the creatures and attacks Spider-Man, who defeats her with Mary Jane Watson's help. However, Black Cat is left grievously wounded by the battle, forcing Spider-Man to choose between leaving her in Mary Jane's care or infecting her with another symbiote to heal her. If the latter choice is made, Black Cat will become Spider-Man's "queen" in one of the game's two black suit endings in which he takes over the symbiote army.
** In the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] versions of the game, Black Cat is placed under mind control by [[Spencer Smythe]] before Spider-Man defeats her and is faced with the choice of either destroying the mind-control device to free her or allowing it to kill her so he can claim the device for himself.

Though she escaped after realizing the extent of Alchemax's corruption, they created clones of her as a security force.
