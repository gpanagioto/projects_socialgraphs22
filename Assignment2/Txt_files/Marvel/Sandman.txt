The '''Sandman''' ('''William Baker''', a.k.a. '''Flint Marko''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] endowed through an accident with the ability to turn himself into sand, he started out as a recurring adversary to the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], but has been slowly redeemed over time, eventually becoming an [[antihero]]. The Sandman has also been an enemy of the [[Fantastic Four]], and a founding member of the supervillain teams [[Sinister Six]] and [[Frightful Four]].

The character has been adapted into various other media incarnations of Spider-Man, including films, television series, and video games. In live-action, he was portrayed by [[Thomas Haden Church]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007) and the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021). A creature based on the "Sandman" appeared in the MCU film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), which was actually an illusion created by a series of drones operated by [[Mysterio]]. In 2009, the Sandman was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 72nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/72.html Sandman is number 72] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231132927/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/72.html|date=December 31, 2013}} [[IGN]].

==Publication history==
The Sandman first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 (Sept. 1963), created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] as an adversary of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 20|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= In this installment, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko introduced Sandman – a super villain who could turn his entire body into sand with a single thought.}}</ref><ref name="Sandman">{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 20|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= In this installment, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko introduced Sandman - a super villain who could turn his entire body into sand with a single thought.}}</ref><ref name="Issue #4">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= Nothing Can Stop...The Sandman!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= #4|date= September 1963}}</ref> The character returned in ''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1 and ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #18-19, and was soon depicted in other comics, such as ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]''.

The Sandman served as the villain of the first issue of the Spider-Man spin-off series ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (March 1972), which gave him a more morally ambiguous depiction. Writer [[Roy Thomas]] later commented, "I've been pleased to see Sandman's gradual redemption, whose seeds perhaps I helped plant in that story.

The Sandman was later an ally of Spider-Man, as well as a reserve member of the Avengers and a member of Silver Sable's "[[Wild Pack]]" team of mercenaries.

Besides being most notable as a Spider-Man supervillain, he has also been depicted as a [[Fantastic Four]] [[List of Fantastic Four enemies|antagonist]] in Stan Lee and [[Jack Kirby]] comic books (mostly due to being introduced as a founding member of the original [[Frightful Four]]<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker=[[Chic Stone|Stone, Chic]]|story= The Attack of the Evil Frightful Four|title= [[Fantastic Four]]|issue=#36 |date= March 1965}}</ref>) along with being on the heroic side (being an [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[List of Avengers members|reserve member]]<ref name="casebook99">{{Cite comic | writer = Marc Steven Sumerak | penciller = Eric Eng Wong | inker = John G.

==Fictional character biography==
William Baker was born in [[Queens]], New York. When he was three years old, his father abandoned him and his mother. In these early years, she took her son to [[Coney Island]] beach. He lost himself happily in sand sculptures, a craft he would use in secondary school under the encouragement of his teacher (and first crush), Miss Flint.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1">[[Peter David|David, Peter]]; ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual'' #1 (July 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In preparatory school, a boy named Vic bullied Baker until he learned to fight using an opponents' motions against themselves, a technique he performed as if he "slipped through their fingers like sand". Vic and his buddies eventually befriended Baker. In high school, William played on his school's football team, using the sport to channel his anger. While playing football, he adopted the nickname "Flint", after his former teacher.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/>

After Vic incurs a large gambling debt to a mobster, he begs Flint to fix a football game he bet on to pay off his debt. Flint does, but is kicked off the team after the coach discovers his involvement. The coach taunts Baker, telling him that he will accomplish nothing of importance in his life. Flint hits his ex-coach, resulting in his expulsion from school and the beginning of his life of crime.

His illegal activity increases in depth and scope, turning him into a violent, bitter man. Eventually he ends up in prison on Ryker's Island where he meets his father, Floyd Baker. He is friendly to his father, but does not tell him who he is. He tells Floyd his nickname, Flint, and a false surname, Marko, inspired by his former coach's taunts about not "making a mark" on the world. He uses the alias Flint Marko from that point on<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/> (he changed his name also to prevent his mother from discovering he was a criminal).<ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]; ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #86 (April 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> After Floyd is released from prison, Marko escapes.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/>

Marko flees to a nuclear testing site on a beach near [[Savannah, Georgia]] where he comes into contact with sand that had been irradiated by an experimental reactor. His body and the radioactive sand [[Chemical bond|bond]], changing Marko's [[Molecule|molecular]] structure into sand. Impressed, he calls himself the Sandman after his new powers.

Marko clashes with Peter Parker/[[Spider-Man]] for the first time in Peter's high school. Spider-Man defeats Marko with a vacuum cleaner and hands it over to the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=303–304}}</ref> The Sandman escapes by getting through his window after turning himself to sand, but is recaptured by the Human Torch after the Torch lures the Sandman to a building by disguising himself as Spider-Man, then activating the sprinkler system. After this Marko resurfaces as a member of the [[Sinister Six]], led by [[Doctor Octopus]]. He battles Spider-Man inside an airtight metal box, which is activated when Spider-Man touches a card saying where the Vulture is, but the Sandman is defeated due to Spider-Man having stronger [[human lung|lungs]] than he does.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Alongside the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], he captures the [[Human Torch]] but later succumbs to Spider-Man and the Human Torch.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #18–19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Spider-Man defeats Marko numerous times, Marko diverts his attention to other superheroes. He teams with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], [[Trapster|Paste-Pot Pete]] (later known as the Trapster) and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] to form the [[Frightful Four]] to combat the [[Fantastic Four]], which attacks during Reed and Sue's engagement party. The Fantastic Four, with the help of a few other superheroes, defeat the group.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> In another battle, in which he teams up with [[Blastaar]] and loses against the Four, he dons a diamond-patterned green costume designed by the Wizard.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #62–63. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he and the [[Hulk]] battle for the first time.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #113. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] joins him in his next conflict against the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #114. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In time the Sandman discovers—-starting with his hands—-that his body can transform into glass and back again. He contracts cancer and takes over a medical research center, battling the Hulk again.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #138. Marvel Comics.</ref> He battles [[Wonder Man]] but is cured of his cancer by radiation.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Afterward, he allies himself with [[Hydro-Man]] to battle their mutual enemy, Spider-Man. An accident merges the two villains into a monster called the Mud-Thing. Spider-Man and the police are able to dehydrate the monstrosity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #217–218. Marvel Comics.</ref> Months later, the supervillains manage to separate themselves and go their separate ways.<ref name=autogenerated6>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #86. Marvel Comics</ref>

The time trapped with Hydro-Man caused Marko to question his bad life choices. The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], after an aborted attempt to fight Baker, urges him to straighten himself out and use his ability to do good.<ref name=autogenerated6/> The story continues when he meets with the Thing for a second time to see a sports game.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #24 (back story) 1990, page 44. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Marko boards with the Cassadas and teams with Spider-Man against the Enforcers.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #138. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Sandman then makes sporadic appearances in Spider-Man comics assisting his former enemy. His first appearance has him coming to the rescue of Spider-Man and [[Silver Sable]], who are outnumbered and surrounded by the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. Silver Sable is impressed by the Sandman's performance and recruits him as a freelance operative.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #280–281. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus coerces him to rejoin the Sinister Six, but Marko turns against them. Doctor Octopus turns him into glass for his treason. Spider-Man, however, saved the Sandman.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #334, 338–339. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sandman also appears as part of the [[The Outlaws (comics)|Outlaws]], a group of reformed Spider-Man enemies, such as the [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]], the [[Rocket Racer]], the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] and the [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]], that on occasion that would aid Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #169. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, he receives a presidential pardon and briefly joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a reserve member.<ref>''Avengers'' #329. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he becomes a full-time mercenary in the employ of [[Silver Sable]], as a member of her [[Wild Pack]], serving alongside heroes such as [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] and [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]].<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Sandman is one of the few heroes temporarily overwhelmed by their evil doubles during the [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]. This double almost kills them all.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Marko turns against Spider-Man and his sometimes ally the Thing and declares his allegiance to evil and his former employer, the Wizard. This change proved incompatible to what many fans had thought Sandman had become, a hero.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> This outcry caused Marvel to rush out a story which retconned ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #4 in which the Wizard had kidnapped the Sandman and used his mind control machine, the Id Machine, to turn him back into a villain.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The machine worked too well and the Sandman went about reforming the Sinister Six to destroy both Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, only to be double-crossed by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], who the Sandman recruited as the sixth member of the team. During Venom's brawl against the Sandman, the vicious black symbiote's mouth rips a chunk of sand from the Sandman. That missing sand destabilizes the Sandman, causing him to lose his ability to maintain his human form. Before falling into the sewer (and as a nod to fans who rejected Marvel's attempt to re-villainize the character), the Sandman admitted that part of the reason for his fall from grace was the trouble he had to really cope with life on the good guys' side, and asks Spider-Man to tell his mother he was sorry he did not fulfill his promise to her, to be a force for good. The Sandman washes away and slides down a sewer, from which he mixes into [[Jones Beach, New York]]<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #22. Marvel Comics</ref> and is thought dead.

The Sandman's body and mind are scattered throughout the beach. This separation lasts too long for him, causing his mind to split into good and its opposite, evil, which when dominant created sand vortexes to ensnare beachcombers. Spider-Man arrived to confront the Sandman, ultimately using the Sandman's mental instability to free his captives and cause him to explode.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #42-43. Marvel Comics.</ref>

His sand wafts throughout New York and touches down into piles forming beings that personify him: the good, the bad, the gentle and the innocent. Spider-Man locates these Sandmen to convince them to unify. The Sandman's evil persona merges with his innocent and gentle personas, but the Sandman's good persona rebuffs the evil one. Because the Sandman's mind can handle his personality in separation for only a limited time, he loses his ability to retain himself, crumbling and blowing away, leaving Spider-Man to ponder the nature of his scuttled foe.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #56–57. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Sandman is one of the villains recruited to recover the [[Identity Disc]], but during its recovery seemingly he is killed in a mutiny. At the series' end, the Sandman is found alive and working with the Vulture to manipulate the other villains.<ref>''Identity Disc'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the storyline "Sandblasted", in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #17–19 (April–June 2007), the Sandman asks Spider-Man to help him redeem his father, who has been charged with and imprisoned for murdering a homeless man. He admits his father was a petty criminal, but insists he would not commit murder. Marko also said the victim resembles Peter Parker's [[Uncle Ben]], who had been murdered years before then. The Sandman and Spider-Man find the killer, the [[Chameleon (comics)#Chameleon 2211|Chameleon 2211]]. The Chameleon 2211 kills the Uncle Ben who the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Hobgoblin 2211|Hobgoblin 2211]] brought from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> and had been posing as him after that. Thanks to Spider-Man, Floyd Baker is switched with the Chameleon 2211 and saved, for which the Sandman thanks Spider-Man.

The Sandman returned in "[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|Spider-Man: The Gauntlet]]" storyline, which redefined the character and his powers/mental state. While investigating a series of murders and a missing girl named Keemia Alvarado, whose mother is a victim of those murders, Spider-Man traces the murders and the abduction to the Sandman, the girl's father, who is hiding on Governor's Island with Keemia. The Sandman's powers have evolved to where he can create duplicates of himself who have their own personalities and, to Marko's shock, claim they committed the murders.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #615">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #615. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man sneaks away and uses a fan to obliterate the Sandmen. Originally Spider-Man believed Keemia would be handed to her grandmother, but instead she was sent to a foster home by [[Child Protective Services]]. [[Carlie Cooper]] is exonerated upon being under police suspicion for tampering with the murder evidences, but the Sandman is still at large.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #616. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species" storyline, the Sandman is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains' team where he becomes involved in a plot to receive a reward and securing some specific items for him. The Sandman went after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant, believing that Doctor Octopus would reward him by reuniting him with Keemia. He ended up being accidentally struck with lightning by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], temporarily turning him into [[fulgurite]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #643. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man goes on a rampage against all the villains after the Chameleon stole the infant and tricked him into believing it had died. At the dock, the Sandman, along with the Shocker and the Enforcers, are hiding. However, Spider-Man collapses the floor of the building which falls into the water. The Sandman attempts to rise to attack, but Spider-Man shoots him using the Shocker's vibrational air-blasts.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]'', he is part of the new Sinister Six along with [[Mysterio]], the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], Doctor Octopus, the Chameleon and Electro. He rises up against Doctor Octopus' plan to detonate New York, saying Keemia is still there.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later angered when, during a confrontation between the Sinister Six and the Intelligencia, Doctor Octopus teleports the Wizard into the upper atmosphere using the Intelligencia's equipment. The Sandman was talking with his former Frightful Four teammate and old friend at the time. When the [[Mad Thinker]] goes after Electro, the Sandman violently attacks him, claiming that he did not want to lose any more friends.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #667. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Doctor Octopus [[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|puts his plan into action]], the Sandman is satisfied with the job because of the planned 2 billion dollar "compensation fee", which he reasons will help him gain custody of Keemia. However, although sent to guard a facility in the Sahara Desert giving him complete control of the largest body of sand in the world, he is defeated by Spider-Man, the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Silver Sable]] when Spider-Man identifies and isolates the one grain of sand that contains his conscious mind.<ref name="asm684">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #684</ref> Spider-Man and Silver Sable then violently interrogate the Sandman to reveal all of Doctor Octopus' secrets to them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Dying Wish]]" storyline, the Sandman's captive form is later stolen from the Baxter Building by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) where he takes him to his underwater lab.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Sandman, the Chameleon, Electro, [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]] (an impersonator of Mysterio), and the Vulture are later seen as part of a team led by the Superior Spider-Man called the "Superior Six". The Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds in order to redeem them for their crimes. He does this by forcing them do heroic deeds against their will, some of which almost get some of them killed. Every time he is done controlling them, he puts them back in their containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> They eventually break free of the Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, while nearly destroying New York in order to do so.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the help of Sun Girl, the Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Inspired by the heroism of the villains who had their moralities inverted by the events of "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]", the Sandman rejoins one of his old gangs and breaks into Ryker's Island in search of the group's leader Dixon. Upon reaching Dixon's cell, the Sandman turns on and incapacitates him and his followers. He then leaves with Dixon's cellmate, a "good egg" whom the Sandman had deemed deserving of a second chance.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Frank Barbiere|penciller = Victor Santos|inker = Victor Santos|colorist = Lauren Affe|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Jake Thomas and Daniel Ketchum|story = AXIS: Revolutions|title = Castles in the Sand|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = December 3, 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, the Sandman is among the villains at the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Secret Wars v2'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Sandman later appears as a member of the Sinister Six led by [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Aaron Davis]] in a recolored [[Iron Spider]] armor. He accompanied the Sinister Six in a plot to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #234. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Infinity Wars]]" storyline, the Sandman is among the villains that accompany [[Turk Barrett]] to his meeting with the [[Infinity Watch]] at Central Park.<ref>''Infinity Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Sandman later discovered that he is starting to lose the consistency of his body. When the Mad Thinker and the Wizard are unable to find a solution to counter this and the Sandman is hospitalized after collapsing, he is visited by Spider-Man, who took him to the beach that the Sandman visited in his childhood and stayed with him until his body broke down. After that happened, Spider-Man discovered that the Sandman did not die and that he lost the ability to assume a human shape, where he now sports a blob-shaped body. When the Sandman's body is taken over by a future version of the Sandman from Earth-51838 where the sun went out, Spider-Man received some of the Sandman's powers and used them to defeat the Sandman of Earth-51838 and sends him back to his reality using the Multisect and assistance from the Human Torch. After bidding farewell to Spider-Man, the Sandman left to get adjusted to his new form while having developed a fear of his newly-discovered immortality.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #308-309. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At an unknown beach, Sandman somehow regained his human shape and has lost his sense of direction. Doctor Octopus helped Sandman regain his sense of direction which pleases [[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|Kindred]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #68. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Sandman has the ability to transform his body. He can will his body to be hardened, compacted, dispersed or shaped, or a combination of those qualities, an Earth manipulation of sand and rock particles. More often than not in combat, this ability enables him to absorb most blows with little to no ill effect other than reforming himself, a relatively fast action. His striped shirt and cargo pants are colored sand to make him appear as if he wears clothes. Even when soaked, he was able to stretch his sand molecules, growing to double his size.

Sandman can mold his arms and hands into shapes, such as a [[Mace (bludgeon)|mace]] or a [[sledgehammer]], to battle Spider-Man and his other enemies. His mass, strength and shape shifting ability correspond to the number of sand and rock particles that comprise him. The more he incorporates (nearby) sand grains and rock granules into his body, the more those qualities are enhanced. Even though he controls every particle in his body, his mind exists in the astral plane. He can turn himself into a [[Dust storm|sandstorm]], which enables him to fly great distances and to suffocate his enemies.

His body takes on sand's chemical qualities, impervious to many, but not all, elements. Once, cement's ingredients were mixed into Sandman. That mixture turned him into cement that dried, rendering him immobile.<ref>''Nova'' #11–12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite this frailty he remained alive, but in a coma-like state for a while before he returned to normal.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} In addition to his superb endurance, the Sandman possesses superhuman strength several times more than Spider-Man's and on a par with the Thing's.

In a story with the Wizard, the Wizard fashioned Sandman a green suit with a belt that contained three buttons that allowed various chemicals to mix into the Sandman's body to enable him to change himself into consistencies related to sand. The suit, like the Sandman's usual "clothes", changed into sand with him.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Eventually, with the disbanding of the original Frightful Four, the Sandman stopped using the suit.{{issue|date=April 2012}}

Temperature does alter the Sandman. At 3,400 degrees Fahrenheit his body turns into glass, also a form he can control. Unlike the Sandman's fast transformation from sand to glass, his transformation from glass to sand takes time.<ref>[[Erik Larsen|Larsen, Erik]]; ''Spider-Man'' #18–23 (Jan.-June 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although he is invulnerable to most physical attacks, even projectiles because they pass through him, water is capable of harming him. There are some exceptions, for example while fighting [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], the villain's powerful mouth ripped cleanly and swiftly into the Sandman. The amount of sand removed abruptly, and perhaps because of Venom's venoms, left the [[mass]] of the Sandman in contortion, crippled beyond immediate repair. The Sandman began to disintegrate, then flowed down a drain, and then washed up onto and into a beach.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #22 (Oct. 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

It has been revealed that, while the Sandman can absorb and lose sand, his body must retain one key particle of sand that contains his conscious mind, allowing Spider-Man to defeat him once by isolating that one grain from the rest of the Sandman (although the difficulty involved in setting up these events in the first place makes it impractical to use regularly).<ref name="asm684"/>

==Family members==
This section lists the known relatives of Sandman:

* '''Floyd Baker''' - The father of William Baker, who was unaware that he was the Sandman during his time in prison.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* '''Keemia Alvarado''' - The foster child of the Sandman.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #615"/>
* '''Mrs. Baker''' (first name unknown) - The mother of William Baker.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other characters named the Sandman==
There have been some other characters in Marvel Comics that have been named the "Sandman":

* In ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'', the Sandman that appears is the [[Sandman]] of legend. He lives in the Land of Dreams, which is located in the Realm of Fairies within the potentially imaginary world of Nowhere. The Sandman ruled over the realm and would place a blanket over it every day. Those who grabbed a dream from the dream tree would have a dream based on whatever they grabbed from the tree and awaken again when the Sandman removed the blanket over his land. Anyone who did not grab a dream would end up in an eternal, dreamless sleep.<ref>''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #41. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* In ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', an alien Sandman crash-landed on Earth where he ended up in Mexico. The local tribespeople thought it was an evil spirit. They took him while he was still weak from his crash and sealed him in a cave with no air and light, where he remained in a state of suspended animation. By the early 1960s, a vacationing Marine named Steve Bronson and his family accidentally unleashed the alien Sandman on the world. The alien Sandman regained its consciousness, recounted its past to the Bronson family and planned to conquer the Earth. Steve Bronson tried to oppose the alien Sandman, but it proved invulnerable to physical assault. The alien Sandman ordered the Bronsons to transport him to North America, so he could observe the most powerful nation on the planet before putting his plan into action. Steve Bronson was able to alert the military to the alien Sandman's presence, but they also proved ineffective in dealing with the extraterrestrial threat. Bullets went right through him, gas was ineffectual because he does not breathe and while bombs would scatter his pieces, he proved capable of reforming himself afterwards. The alien Sandman planned to increase its size by absorbing every sand on the beaches until nothing can stop him. Steve Bronson's son Bobby heard about the plan and headed to the beach with a plan of his own. Bobby threw a pile of water over the sand, which made the alien Sandman soggy to the point where he could not move. The military quickly transported the alien Sandman's body to a top-secret underground facility where he has remained ever since.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #70. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A version of the Sandman similar to a past version of his 616 counterpart appears as part of a version of the [[Sinister Six]]. After Zombie Spider-Man teleports into this reality, the Kingpin sends the Six to fight "Spider-Man". The other five members are violently killed by the Zombie Spider-Man and the Sandman flees, later encountering and killing his own reality's Spider-Man out of fear by forcing his own sand body mass down Spider-Man's throat and causing his stomach to bloat to massive proportions before violently exploding out of his chest. He is also disappointed by the seeming betrayal of his enemy, thinking that if Spider-Man is now willing to kill, then the Sandman will also kill. Decades later, the Sandman is infused with a nanite cure developed by Tony Stark and the Zombie Spider-Man that incorporates Wolverine's healing factor, which allows him to safely confront the zombies. Working with a few allies that oppose the murderous zombies, the Sandman springs his trap. All the zombies fall, destroyed from within. Upon his final death, Zombie Spider-Man thanks the Sandman for avenging Aunt May and Mary Jane, to which the Sandman replies, "Good riddance, ya disgusting freak".

Shortly after Justin Hammer dies of a heart attack during [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]]'s fight with [[Doctor Octopus#Ultimate Marvel|Doctor Octopus]], S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltrates Hammer's factory to obtain experiments Hammer had been working on. Marko uses this opportunity to escape and wreak havoc in [[New Jersey]].

There, he meets fellow genetically altered criminals [[Green Goblin (Ultimate Marvel character)|Green Goblin]], Doctor Octopus, [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]], and [[Kraven the Hunter#Ultimate Marvel|Kraven the Hunter]].

Osborn then blackmails Peter into joining the team, forming the [[Ultimate Six]]. Marko participates with the group in an attack on the [[White House]]. [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]] defeats Marko. After the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. seals Marko in various jars and keeps them frozen.<ref>''Ultimate Six'' #1–7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Artist [[Mark Bagley]], who drew the first 100+ issues of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', noted in his rough designs for the Ultimate Sandman that he would appear "[[Nudity|naked]]" most of the time.

Though they escape in a [[Quinjet]], Sandman sneaks aboard and tries to attack them, only to be crystallized by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and later imprisoned in an hourglass-like containment unit. In the episode "Sandman Returns", the [[Awesome Android]] frees Sandman, who helps Spider-Man defeat it.

Despite his allies telling him otherwise, Spider-Man reasons with Sandman and convinces him to return to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody.

* [[Thomas Haden Church]] portrays Flint Marko / Sandman in two live-action Marvel films. This version is portrayed as a tragic and sympathetic criminal who is desperate to raise money for his [[Intensive care medicine|critically ill]] daughter, Penny, and becomes the Sandman after an accident involving an experimental [[particle accelerator]] that bonded him with sand at the molecular level, giving him sand-based [[shapeshifting]] abilities.

After Spider-Man obtains his [[Venom (character)|black suit]], which increases his aggressiveness, and learns that Marko was Ben's killer, he fights and seemingly kills him in the sewers. Marko later reconstitutes himself and encounters [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], who persuades him to join forces to kill Spider-Man. They kidnap [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Mary Jane Watson]] and lure Spider-Man to a construction site, where they nearly succeed until [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Harry Osborn]] intervenes and defeats Marko.
