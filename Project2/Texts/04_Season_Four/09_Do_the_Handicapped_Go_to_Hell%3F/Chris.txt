 Yeah? Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.  Is that the movers, Satan? Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter.  Those were some great pork chops, Satan. Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up? Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.  Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?  I wasn't ready for that. I thought you... killed him. ...Do you still love him? It's okay of you do. Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults. We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy. Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.   There you are. I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad. Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight. I just think we all need to get this out in the open.  Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together. Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore. Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.  Oh, thank you. Satan, what the heck is wrong with you? Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready. So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once. Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy. L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends. I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  Right. ''Hoof''. Well, I don't know about ''you'' guys, but all that ginger made me tired. Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!   You take it now! I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that. But it turns you on. But what?  Okay. I love you, Satan. It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do. Yeah. Sure. Okay.
