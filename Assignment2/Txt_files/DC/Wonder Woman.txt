Wonder Woman's origin story (from Golden to Bronze Age) relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] and was given a life as an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]], along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods. In 2011, DC changed her background with the [[retcon]] that she is the biological daughter of [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe. The character has changed in depiction over the decades, including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late 1960s; by the 1980s, artist [[George Perez]] gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage.<ref>{{cite web |last=Beedle |first=Tim |url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/12/26/ten-moments-that-mattered-wonder-woman-becomes-war |title=Ten Moments that Mattered: Wonder Woman Becomes War &#124; DC |website=Dccomics.com |date=December 25, 2013 |access-date=December 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108134755/http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/12/26/ten-moments-that-mattered-wonder-woman-becomes-war |archive-date=November 8, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |url=http://www.newsarama.com/18787-wonder-woman-kills-who-is-the-new-god-of-what-azzarello-explains-spoilers.html |title=WONDER WOMAN Kills...Who?

Wonder Woman's character was created during World War II; the character in the story was initially depicted fighting Axis forces as well as an assortment of colorful [[supervillain]]s, although over time her stories came to place greater emphasis on characters, deities, and monsters from Greek mythology. Many stories depicted Wonder Woman freeing herself from bondage, which counterpointed the "damsels in distress" trope that was common in comics during the 1940s.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://superdames.org/image/143332720966 |title = Superdames!: Photo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://78.media.tumblr.com/f602627a65096985c1f0ef8fcb9766c9/tumblr_inline_o8cqw88EpY1rrbhi0_500.png |title=Wonder woman -- you saved my life!

{{quote|William Moulton Marston, a psychologist already famous for inventing the [[polygraph]], struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero, one who would triumph not with fists or firepower, but with love. "Fine," said Elizabeth. "But make her a woman."}}

Marston introduced the idea to Gaines. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed ''Wonder Woman'', whom he believed to be a model of that era's unconventional, liberated woman. Marston also drew inspiration from the bracelets worn by [[Olive Byrne]], who lived with the couple in a [[polyamorous]] relationship.<ref>{{Cite book | first=Les | last=Daniels | title=Wonder Woman: The Complete History | publisher=Chronicle Books | date=April 6, 2004 | pages=28–30 | isbn=978-0-8118-4233-4}}</ref> Wonder Woman debuted in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' [[Introducing Wonder Woman|#8]] ([[cover date]] Dec/Jan 1941/1942, released in October 1941),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dcindexes.com/features/comic.php?comicid=2249 |title=All-Star Comics #8 |author=Library of Congress |website=dcindexes.com |publisher=Mike's Amazing World |access-date=May 19, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907075954/http://www.dcindexes.com/features/comic.php?comicid=2249 |archive-date=September 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> scripted by Marston. Marston was the creator of a systolic-blood-pressure-measuring apparatus, which was crucial to the development of the polygraph ([[polygraph|lie detector]]).

Marston designed Wonder Woman to be an allegory for the [[Love leadership|ideal love leader]]; the kind of woman who he believed should run society. "Frankly, Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who, I believe, should rule the world", Marston wrote.<ref name="Hendrix2007">{{Cite news|title=Out for Justice|last=Hendrix|first=Grady|date=December 11, 2007|newspaper=[[The New York Sun]]}}</ref>

Initially, Wonder Woman was an Amazon champion who wins the right to return [[Steve Trevor]]{{spaced ndash}}a United States intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons' isolated island homeland{{spaced ndash}}to "Man's World" and to fight crime and the evil of the [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>''All Star Comics'' #8 (October 1941)</ref>

During this period, Wonder Woman joined the [[Justice Society of America]] as the team's secretary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanley|first=Tim|title=Wonder Woman: Secretary Of The Justice Society Of America|url=http://thanley.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/wonder-woman-secretary-of-the-justice-society-of-america/|publisher=Straitened Circumstances|access-date=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607233855/http://thanley.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/wonder-woman-secretary-of-the-justice-society-of-america/|archive-date=June 7, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|date=June 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>''All Star Comics'' #12 (August/September 1942)</ref>

=== Silver Age ===
{{main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}
During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], under writer [[Robert Kanigher]], Wonder Woman's origin was revamped,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #98 (May 1958)</ref> along with other characters'. The new origin story increased the character's [[wikt:Hellenism|Hellenic]] and mythological roots: receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib, Diana is destined to become as "beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], strong as [[Hercules]], and swift as [[Hermes]]."<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105">''Wonder Woman'' #105 (April 1959)</ref>

At the end of the 1960s, under the guidance of [[Mike Sekowsky]], Wonder Woman surrendered her powers in order to remain in Man's World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension. Wonder Woman begins using the alias [[Diana Prince]] and opens a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] boutique. She acquires a Chinese mentor named [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]], who teaches Diana [[martial arts]] and weapons skills. Using her fighting skill instead of her powers, Diana engaged in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #179 (1968)</ref><ref name="Reed">{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Bill|title=365 Reasons to Love Comics|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/05/365-reasons-to-love-comics-64/|website=Comic Book Resources|date=March 5, 2007|access-date=March 5, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312235637/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/05/365-reasons-to-love-comics-64/|archive-date=March 12, 2007|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This phase of her story was directly influenced by the British spy thriller ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and [[Diana Rigg]]'s portrayal of [[Emma Peel]].<ref>"We were all in love with Diana Rigg and that show she was on." Mike Sekowsky, quoted in Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History'' (Chronicle, 2004), p. 129.</ref>

=== Bronze Age ===
{{main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}
In the early 1970s the character returned to her superhero roots in the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' and to the [[World War II]] era in her own title.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #204</ref> This, however, was ultimately due to the popularity of the TV series at the time also having Wonder Woman set in the WWII era, and was shifted back to the 1970s era once the TV show did the same.

With a new decade arriving, DC president [[Jenette Kahn]] ordered a revamp in Wonder Woman's appearance. Artist [[Milton Glaser]], who also designed the "bullet" logo adopted by DC in 1977, created a stylized "WW" emblem that evoked and replaced the eagle in her bodice and debuted in 1982.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1980s|author=Keith Dallas, Jason Sacks, Jim Beard, Dave Dykema, Paul Brian McCoy|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1605490465|pages=47–8}}</ref> The emblem in turn was incorporated by studio letterer [[Todd Klein]] onto the monthly title's logo, which lasted for a year and a half before being replaced by a version from Glaser's studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kleinletters.com/Blog/logo-study-wonder-woman-part-3/|title=Logo Study: WONDER WOMAN part 3|author=Klein, Todd|publisher=Klein Letters|date=January 18, 2008|access-date=April 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814175108/http://kleinletters.com/Blog/logo-study-wonder-woman-part-3/|archive-date=August 14, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=Todd Klein}}</ref> The series was canceled with issue #329 (February 1986) written by Gerry Conway, depicting Steve Trevor's marriage to Wonder Woman.

Following the 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' series, [[George Pérez]], [[Len Wein]], and [[Greg Potter]] rewrote the character's origin story, depicting Wonder Woman as an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] to Patriarch's World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Pérez incorporated a variety of deities and concepts from Greek mythology in Wonder Woman's stories and origin. His rendition of the character acted as the foundation for the modern Wonder Woman stories, as he expanded upon the widely accepted origin of Diana being birthed out of clay. The relaunch was a critical and commercial success.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Mangels, Andy|date= January 1, 1989|title= Triple Threat The George Pérez Interview|journal= Amazing Heroes|issue= #156|page= 30|publisher= [[Fantagraphics Books]]|quote = ''Wonder Woman's'' sales are some of the best the Amazing Amazon has ever experienced, and the book is a critical and popular success with its weaving of Greek mythology into a feminist and humanistic atmosphere.|author-link= Andy Mangels}}</ref>

In August 2010 (issue #600), [[J.

In 2011's [[The New 52]], DC Comics relaunched its entire line of publications to attract a new generation of readers, and thus released volume 4 of the ''Wonder Woman'' comic book title. [[Brian Azzarello]] and [[Cliff Chiang]] were assigned writing and art duties respectively and revamped the character's history considerably. In this new continuity, Wonder Woman wears a costume similar to her original Marston costume, utilizes a sword and shield, and has a completely new origin. No longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods, she is, instead, a [[demi-goddess]] and the natural-born daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]]. Azzarello and Chiang's revamp of the character was critically acclaimed, but highly divisive among longtime fans of the character.<ref>{{cite web|first=Joey|last=Esposito|title=The Best of DC Comics in 2011|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/14/the-best-of-dc-comics-in-2011-2|website=IGN|date=December 14, 2011|access-date=December 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007203245/http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/14/the-best-of-dc-comics-in-2011-2|archive-date=October 7, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last= Renaud| first= Jeffrey| title= Azzarello Lowers the Boom(Tube) on Wonder Woman| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40597| website= Comic Book Resources| access-date= August 22, 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120824065430/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40597| archive-date= August 24, 2012| url-status= live| df= mdy-all| date= August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Garcia|first=Joe|title=The Best & Worst of DC Comics' New 52, One Year Later|url=http://fronttowardsgamer.com/2012/09/05/the-best-worst-of-dc-comics-new-52-one-year-later/|publisher=Front Towards Gamer|access-date=September 5, 2012|quote=Despite being one part of the Justice League's "Holy Trinity", Wonder Woman never seems to get the recognition that she deserves.

In 2016, DC Comics once again relaunched all of its publications as part of the "[[DC Rebirth]]" continuity reboot, and the new fifth volume of ''Wonder Woman'' was released semi-monthly with writer [[Greg Rucka]]. This fifth volume of ''Wonder Woman'' is part of the "DC Universe", the current continuity established after Rebirth. Initially, the new series does not use a regular storyline that exists between each issue; instead two separate storylines share the book, with an installment of one story published every other issue, and those of the other storyline published in between those. This practice began with the storyline "The Lies", for the odd numbered issues, and "Year One", for the even numbered issues. The new storyline as presented in these issues effectively retcons the events from the previous New 52 series. "The Lies"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/03/03/wonder-woman-the-story-keeps-changing|title=Wonder Woman: The Story Keeps Changing|date=March 3, 2017|access-date=November 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014125526/http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/03/03/wonder-woman-the-story-keeps-changing|archive-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> storyline reveals that numerous events from the previous ''Wonder Woman'' series, in which Diana was made the Queen of the Amazons and the God of War, were in fact all an illusion created by a mysterious villain, and she had never once been back to Themyscira ever since she left, nor is she capable of returning there.

===Diana Prince===
{{main|Diana Prince}}
The "battle pass" identity has been part of Wonder Woman's history since her comics debut in 1941. In the early Golden Age stories, Wonder Woman served as a military secretary during World War II, using Prince as her cover. Later occupations Wonder Woman performed as Prince included translator at the [[United Nations]], Air Force captain and ambassador, and in the '70s TV series, Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman used Prince to serve as an agent of the Inter-Agency Defense Command. In the [[DC Extended Universe]], Prince works as [[curator]] for the Department of Antiquities<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w54VkC1s1g |title=Analysis of WONDER WOMAN - Scene 1 Louvre - Justice League Universe Podcast |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=April 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801213753/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w54VkC1s1g |archive-date=August 1, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref> at the extremely prestigious [[Louvre Museum]] and is held in very high esteem by the curator of the [[Gotham City]] Museum of Antiquities.

During Marston's run, Diana Prince was the name of an army nurse whom Wonder Woman met. The nurse wanted to meet with her fiancé, who was transferred to South America, but was unable to arrange for money to do so. As Wonder Woman needed a secret identity to look after Steve (who was admitted to the same army hospital in which Diana Prince worked), and because both of them looked alike, Wonder Woman gave the nurse money to go to her fiancé in exchange for the nurse's credentials and took Diana Prince as her alias.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> She started to work as an army nurse and later as an Air Force secretary.<ref name="Gutierrez"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Love Ya but You're Strange – That Time the Husband of Wonder Woman's Exact Double Chained Her to a Table|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/07/12/i-love-ya-but-youre-strange-that-time-the-husband-of-wonder-womans-exact-double-chained-her-to-a-table/|website=Comic Book Resources|access-date=July 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715043851/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/07/12/i-love-ya-but-youre-strange-that-time-the-husband-of-wonder-womans-exact-double-chained-her-to-a-table/|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The identity of Diana Prince was especially prominent in a series published in the early 1970s, in which she fought crime only under the Prince alias and without her mystic powers. To support herself, she ran a mod clothing boutique.<ref name="Hanley"/><ref name="Diana's Memory Album"/>

The Diana Prince alias also played an important role after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Wonder Woman was broadcast worldwide killing a villain named [[Maxwell Lord]], as he was mind controlling Superman into killing Batman. When Wonder Woman caught him in her lasso, demanding to know how to stop Superman, Maxwell revealed that the only way to stop him was to kill Lord, so as a last resort Diana snapped his neck.<ref name=WW219 /><ref name="Goldstein">{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|title=Defending Wonder Woman|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/01/defending-wonder-woman|website=IGN|date=August 2005|access-date=August 1, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023125025/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/01/defending-wonder-woman|archive-date=October 23, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> To recover from the trauma of killing another person, the Amazon went into a self-imposed exile for one year.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7</ref> On her return to public life, Diana realized that her life as a full-time celebrity superhero and ambassador had kept her removed from humanity.

The New 52 continuity did not feature the Diana Prince identity, as series writer Brian Azzarello stated in an interview.<ref>{{cite web|last=Azzarello|first=Brian|title=No, she (Wonder Woman) doesn't (have a secret identity|url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/21/the-new-52-interviews-wonder-woman|website=IGN|date=September 21, 2011|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808045811/http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/21/the-new-52-interviews-wonder-woman|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, when she and Superman began dating, for her civilian identity she used the Diana Prince alias whenever she was around Clark Kent; such as when she introduced herself to [[Lois Lane]] at Lois's housewarming party under that name.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 3) #19.

Many writers have depicted Diana in different personalities and tone; between both of her diametric extremes; that of a worldly warrior, a highly compassionate and calm ambassador, and sometimes also as a naive and innocent person, depending on the writer. What has remained in constant existence, and is a mainstay of the character, is the dichotomy of her dominant force aspect and her nurturing humanity: her overwhelming belief in love, empathy, compassion, and having a strong conscience.  The latter aspect had been the reason for her induction into the [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]s.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (2010)</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Star Sapphires|url=http://www.wonderali.com/2010/01/welcome-to-the-star-sapphires-2/|publisher=WonderAli|access-date=January 11, 2010|author=WonderAli|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529171046/http://www.wonderali.com/2010/01/welcome-to-the-star-sapphires-2/|archive-date=May 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In the Golden Age, Wonder Woman adhered to an Amazon code of helping any in need, even [[misogynist]]ic people, and never accepting a reward for saving someone;<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G.

Diana, after her death, was granted divinity as the Goddess of Truth by her gods for such faithful devotion.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #127 (November 1997)</ref> During her brief time as a god of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], Diana was replaced in the role of Wonder Woman by her mother, [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #128 (December 1997)</ref> Unlike Diana receiving the title of Wonder Woman in honor, Hippolyta's role as Wonder Woman was meant to be a punishment for her betrayal in Artemis' death as well as for unintentionally killing her own daughter.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #129 (January 1998)</ref>

John Byrne, the writer that introduced the concept of Hippolyta as the first Wonder Woman, has explained his intentions in a post in his message board:

<blockquote>I thought George's one "mistake" in rebooting Wonder Woman was making her only 25 years old when she left Paradise Island. I preferred the idea of a Diana who was thousands of years old (as, if I recall correctly, she was in the TV series). From that angle, I would have liked to have seen Diana having been Wonder Woman in WW2, and be returning to our world in the reboot.<ref name=ByrneRobotics>{{cite web |url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17792 |title=Wonder Woman revisited |publisher=Byrne Robotics |access-date=January 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518044601/http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17792 |archive-date=May 18, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Not having that option, I took the next best course, and had Hippolyta fill that role.<ref name=ByrneRobotics/></blockquote>

As Wonder Woman, Queen Hippolyta immediately got involved in a time travel mission back to the 1940s with [[Jay Garrick]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #130–133 (February–May 1998). DC Comics.</ref> After this mission, she elected to join the [[Justice Society of America]] and remained in that era for eight years, where her teammates nicknamed her "Polly". During that time she had a relationship with [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Ted Grant]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #185 (November 2002). DC Comics.</ref> Hippolyta also made visits into the past to see her godchild [[Fury (DC Comics)|Lyta]], daughter of Hippolyta's protege Helena, the Golden Age Fury. These visits happened yearly from young Lyta's perspective and also accounted for Hippolyta's participation in the JSA/JLA team ups. When she returned from the past, Hippolyta took Diana's place in the [[Justice League|JLA]] as well.<ref>''JLA'' #18–23 (May–October 1998)</ref><ref>''JLA'' #30 (June 1999). DC Comics.</ref>

Following Wonder Woman's ascension to heaven and return to the living in ''[[Infinite Frontier]]'', she officially gives her blessing for her mother Hippolyta and her Amazon sister Nubia to share the title of Wonder Woman, meaning there are now three Wonder Women in current continuity.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #780 (2021).

==Fictional character biography==
===20th century===
====Origin====
In her debut in ''All Star Comics'' #8, Diana was a member of a tribe of women called the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], native to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]{{spaced ndash}}a secluded island set in the middle of a vast ocean. [[Steve Trevor|Captain Steve Trevor]]'s plane crashes on the island and he is found alive but unconscious by Diana and fellow Amazon, and friend, Mala. Diana has him nursed back to health and falls in love with him. A competition is held amongst all the Amazons by Diana's mother, the Queen of the Amazons [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]], in order to determine who is the most worthy of all the women; Hippolyta charges the winner with the responsibility of delivering Captain Steve Trevor back to Man's World and to fight for justice. Hippolyta forbids Diana from entering the competition, but she takes part nonetheless, wearing a mask to conceal her identity. She wins the competition and reveals herself, surprising Hippolyta, who ultimately accepts, and must give in to, Diana's wish to go to Man's World. She then is awarded a special uniform made by her mother for her new role as Wonder Woman and safely returns Steve Trevor to his home country.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist =[[Harry G.

====Golden Age====
{{main|Golden Age of Comic Books}}
Coming to America for the first time, Wonder Woman comes upon a wailing army nurse who happens to look identical to her. Inquiring about her state, she finds that the nurse wanted to leave for South America with her fiancé but was unable due to shortage of money. As Wonder Woman needed a job and a valid identity to look after Steve (who was admitted in the same army hospital), she gives her the money she had earned earlier to help her go to her fiancé in exchange for her credentials. The nurse reveals her name as Diana Prince, and thus, Wonder Woman's secret identity was created, and she began working as a nurse in the army.<ref name="Gutierrez">{{cite web|last=Gutierrez|first=Jon|title=The 6 Worst Jobs Wonder Woman Ever Had|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/03/the_6_worst_jobs_wonder_woman_ever_had.php|publisher=Topless Robot|access-date=March 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401191036/http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/03/the_6_worst_jobs_wonder_woman_ever_had.php|archive-date=April 1, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|date=March 30, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G.

Wonder Woman then took part in a variety of adventures, mostly side by side with Trevor. Her most common foes during this period would be [[Nazi forces]] led by a German baroness named [[Paula von Gunther]], occasionally evil deities/demigods such as [[Ares (comics)|Mars]] and the [[Duke of Deception]], and then colorful villains like [[Hypnota]], [[Doctor Psycho]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=When We First Met – Wonder Woman's Golden Age Rogues|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/10/28/when-we-first-met-wonder-womans-golden-age-rogues/|website=Comic Book Resources|access-date=October 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101050244/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/10/28/when-we-first-met-wonder-womans-golden-age-rogues/|archive-date=November 1, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Silver Age====
{{main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}
In the Silver Age, Wonder Woman's history received several changes. Her earlier origin, which had significant ties to [[World War II]], was changed and her powers were shown to be the product of the [[Greek mythology|gods']] blessings, corresponding to her epithet, "beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, stronger than Hercules, and swifter than Hermes".<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The complicated origin of Wonder Woman|url=http://marionetteblog.blogspot.in/2005/09/complicated-origin-of-wonder-woman.html|publisher=Dance of the Puppets|access-date=September 28, 2005|author=MARIONETTE|date=September 28, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821210849/http://marionetteblog.blogspot.in/2005/09/complicated-origin-of-wonder-woman.html|archive-date=August 21, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The concepts of [[Wonder Girl]] and [[Wonder Tot]] were also introduced during this period.<ref>{{cite web| last= Hanley| first= Tim| title= A Book Look: Kanigher's Giant Birds| url= https://thanley.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/a-book-look-kanigher%E2%80%99s-giant-birds/| publisher= Straitened Circumstances| access-date= January 10, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110112084021/http://thanley.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/a-book-look-kanigher%E2%80%99s-giant-birds/| archive-date= January 12, 2011| url-status= live| df= mdy-all| date= January 10, 2011}}</ref>

''Wonder Woman'' #179 (November 1969) showed Wonder Woman giving up her powers and returning her costume and title to her mother, in order to continue staying in Man's World. The reason behind this was that all the Amazons were shifting to another dimension, but Diana was unable to accompany them as she needed to stay behind to help Steve, who had been wrongly convicted.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Denny O'Neil| penciller=Mike Sekowsky| inker=Dick Giordano| story=Wonder Woman's Last Battle| title=Wonder Woman| volume=| issue=#179| date=November 1968}}</ref> Thus, she no longer held the title of Wonder Woman and after meeting and training under a blind martial arts mentor [[I Ching (comics)|I-Ching]], Diana resumed crime fighting as the powerless Diana Prince.

=====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''=====
The events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' greatly changed and altered the history of the [[DC Universe]]. Wonder Woman's history and origin were considerably revamped by the event. Wonder Woman was now an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] (the new name for Paradise Island) to Patriarch's World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Various deities and concepts from [[Greek mythology]] were blended and incorporated into Wonder Woman's stories and origin. Diana was formed out of clay of the shores of Themyscira by [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]], who wished for a child; the clay figure was then brought to life by the Greek deities. The gods then blessed and granted her unique powers and abilities{{spaced ndash}}beauty from Aphrodite, strength from Demeter, wisdom from Athena, speed and flight from Hermes, Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts from Artemis and sisterhood with fire and the ability to discern the truth from Hestia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Colluccio|first=Ali|title=Top 5: Wonder Woman Reboots|date=April 10, 2012|url=http://ifanboy.com/articles/top-5-wonder-woman-reboots/|publisher=iFanboy|access-date=April 10, 2012|quote=After she was "erased" from existence in the final pages of Crisis on Infinite Earths, George Perez, Len Wein and Greg Potter brought the Amazon Princess back to the DC Universe.

Starting in ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #51, the Amazons, who had revealed their presence to the world in ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #50, are blamed for a series of murders and for the theft of various artifacts. The Amazons are then taken into custody, Queen [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] is nowhere to be found and Steve Trevor is forced by General Yedziniak to attack Themyscira. These events lead to the "[[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]]" occurring. The culprit of the murders, thefts and the framing of the Amazons is revealed to be the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], who "kills" Diana by reverting her form back into the clay she was born from.

The demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] engaged Diana in battle and managed to kill her. [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|The Olympian Gods]] granted Diana divinity and the role of the Goddess of Truth who started to reside in Olympus; her mother Hippolyta then assumed the role of Wonder Woman and wore her own different incarnation of the costume. In ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #136, Diana was banished from Olympus due to interfering in earthly matters (as Diana was unable to simply watch over people's misery on Earth). She immediately returned to her duties as Wonder Woman, but ran into conflicts with her mother over her true place and role as Hippolyta seemed accustomed to her life in America. Their fight remained unsolved, as Hippolyta died during an intergalactic [[Our Worlds at War|war]]. Themyscira was destroyed during the war, but was restored and reformed as a collection of floating islands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wonder Woman & Hippolyta – As All Great Heroes Do...|url=http://www.cosmicteams.com/profiles/wonderwoman.html|publisher=Cosmic Teams|access-date=November 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227213145/http://www.cosmicteams.com/profiles/wonderwoman.html|archive-date=December 27, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Circe later resurrected Hippolyta in ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #8.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Jodi Picoult| penciller=Terry Dodson| inker=Rachel Dodson| story=Love and Murder, Part 3| title=Wonder Woman| volume=3| issue=#8| date=June 2007| publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

{{Main|Infinite Crisis|The OMAC Project}}
One of the events that led to the "[[Infinite Crisis]]" storyline was Wonder Woman killing the villain [[Maxwell Lord]] in ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #219. Maxwell Lord was mind-controlling [[Superman]], who as a result was near to killing [[Batman]]. Wonder Woman tried to stop Superman, Lord (who was unable to mind control her) made Superman see her as his enemy [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] trying to kill [[Lois Lane]]. Superman then attacked Wonder Woman, and a vicious battle ensued. Buying herself time by slicing Superman's throat with her tiara, Wonder Woman caught Lord in her Lasso of Truth and demanded to know how to stop his control over Superman. As the lasso forced the wearer to speak only the truth, Lord told her that the only way to stop him was to kill him. Left with no choice, Wonder Woman snapped Lord's neck and ended his control over Superman.<ref>{{cite web| last= Goldstein| first= Hilary| title= Infinite Crisis Guide| url= https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/23/infinite-crisis-guide?page=2| website= IGN| date= March 23, 2005| access-date= March 23, 2005| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140429221238/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/23/infinite-crisis-guide?page=2| archive-date= April 29, 2014| url-status= live| df= mdy-all}}</ref> Unknown to her, the entire scene was broadcast live around every channel in the world by [[Brother Eye]].

At the end of ''Infinite Crisis'', Wonder Woman temporarily retires from her costumed identity. Diana, once again using the alias Diana Prince, joins the Department of [[Metahuman]] Affairs. [[Donna Troy]] becomes the new Wonder Woman and is captured by Diana's enemies. Diana then goes on a mission to rescue her sister, battling Circe and [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]]. Diana defeats the villains, freeing Donna and takes up the role of Wonder Woman again. Circe places a spell on Diana, which renders Diana into a normal, powerless human being when in the role of Diana Prince; her powers come to her only when she is in the role of Wonder Woman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Allan Heinberg| penciller=Terry Dodson| inker=Rachel Dodson| story=Who is Wonder Woman?: Part One| title=Wonder Woman| volume=3| issue=#1| date=August 2006| publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=Allan Heinberg| penciller=Terry Dodson| inker=Rachel Dodson| story=Who is Wonder Woman?: Part Two| title=Wonder Woman| volume=3| issue=#2| date=September 2006| publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=Allan Heinberg| penciller=Terry Dodson| inker=Rachel Dodson| story=Who is Wonder Woman?: Part Three| title=Wonder Woman| volume=3| issue=3| date=October 2006| publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=Allan Heinberg| penciller=Terry Dodson| inker=Rachel Dodson| story=Who is Wonder Woman?: Part Four| title=Wonder Woman| volume=3| issue=#4| date=February 2007| publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=Allan Heinberg| penciller=Terry Dodson| inker=Rachel Dodson| story=Who is Wonder Woman?: Part Five| title=Wonder Woman Annual| volume=3| issue=#1| date=November 2007| publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

In September 2011, DC Comics relaunched its entire publication line in an initiative called [[The New 52]]. Among the major changes to the character, Wonder Woman now appears wearing a new costume similar to her older one, and has a completely new origin. In this new timeline, Wonder Woman is no longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods. Rather, she is the [[demigod]]dess daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus: King of the Greek Gods. Her original origin is revealed as a cover story to explain Diana's birth as a means to protect her from Hera's wrath. Currently, Diana has taken on the role and title as the new "God of War".<ref>{{cite news| last=Ching| first=Albert| title=WONDER WOMAN Gets a NEW 52 Origin, Parent in November| url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/wonder-woman-new-origin-111010.html| work=Newsarama| access-date=October 10, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011104936/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/wonder-woman-new-origin-111010.html| archive-date=October 11, 2011| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last=Gregorian| first=Dareh| title=Zeus your daddy, Diana!| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/zeus_your_daddy_diana_ppW48O4ICruECUubnH5G1H| newspaper=New York Post| access-date=October 10, 2011}}</ref>

====DC Rebirth====
{{main|DC Rebirth}}
In 2016, DC Comics implemented [[DC Rebirth]], the second relaunch since 2011's The New 52, which reset some of the continuity changes effected by The New 52.

Following the events of the Darkseid War, Wonder Woman is told by the dying Myrina Black that on the night of Diana's birth, Hippolyta gave birth to a twin brother who was born after her. This child was revealed to be male, known as Jason, and is said to be incredibly powerful. Wonder Woman makes it her mission to find him.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #50 (2016). DC Comics.</ref>

The "Lies" story arc runs parallel with and explores Diana's search. No longer able to get into Mount Olympus, Diana tracks down Barbara Ann Minerva, the Cheetah, to get help.<ref>''Wonder Woman: Rebirth'' #1 (2016). DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #1 (2016). DC Comics.</ref>

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Doctor Poison attended the meeting established by the Riddler and mentioned a rumor that Wonder Woman was forcefully dragged back to Themyscira by her fellow Amazons.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> Wonder Woman comes out of hiding to address the United Nations, hoping to defuse the metahuman arms race. However, the summit is interrupted by Black Adam, the Creeper, and Giganta, who take advantage of the absence of most of Earth's superheroes to attack the UN at the time when the superheroes were confronting [[Doctor Manhattan]] on Mars.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #9. DC Comics.</ref>

== Abilities ==
===Powers and training===
[[File:WonderWoman1970s.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Wonder Woman without special powers fighting crime as Diana Prince. Cover of ''Wonder Woman'' #189 (July 1970). Mike Sekowsky]]
Diana is depicted as a masterful athlete, acrobat, fighter and strategist, trained and experienced in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat, including exclusive Amazonian martial arts. With her godlike abilities of incalculable superhuman strength, nigh-invulnerability, speed, flight, fast healing and semi-immortality, Diana's fighting prowess is enhanced. In some versions, her mother trained her, as Wonder Girl, for a future career as Wonder Woman. From the beginning, she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso.<ref>''[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]'' #4 (December 2008)</ref> Batman once called her the "best melee fighter in the world".<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13 (November 2007)</ref> The modern version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary.<ref name=WW219>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #219 (September 2005)</ref> In the New 52 continuity, her superior combat skills are the result of her Amazon training, as well as receiving further training from Ares, the God of War, himself, since as early as her childhood.<ref name="Azzarello2"/> The Golden Age Wonder Woman also had education in advanced arts and sciences as well as psychology, emotions, and emotional intelligence, as did her Amazon sisters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1e3a702785744b78d2c99d40c588ece5.webp |title=Diana! |access-date=June 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd44ee6ab515846cc0488d139e8652c9.webp |title=Uh-Uh.

====Pre-''Crisis''====
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] had strength that was comparable to the Golden Age Superman. Wonder Woman was capable of bench pressing 15,000 pounds even before she had received her bracelets, and later hoisted a 50,000 pound boulder above her head to inspire Amazons facing the test.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G. Peter |title= Wonder Woman |issue= #13 | pages=3–5 | publisher= All American Comics| date=1945}}</ref> Even when her super strength was temporarily nullified, she still had enough mortal strength of an Amazon to break down a prison door to save Steve Trevor.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #6 (June 1942)</ref> In one of her earliest appearances, she is shown running easily at {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}}, and later jumps from a building{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and lands on [[Ball (foot)|the balls of her feet]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton | artist= [[Harry G. Peter]] |title= Sensation Comics|issue= #1 | pages=5–7 | publisher= All American Comics| date=1942}}</ref>

Her strength would be removed in accordance with "Aphrodite's Law" if she allowed her bracelets to be bound or chained by a male.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/12/wonder-woman | title=Wonder Woman: A psychologist's creation| journal=[[Monitor on Psychology]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|location = Washington, D.C. | first=Nick|last=Joyce | date=December 2008|volume=39|issue=11| access-date=November 20, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108100232/https://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/12/wonder-woman | archive-date=November 8, 2020 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

She also had an array of mental and psychic abilities, as corresponding to Marston's interest in parapsychology and metaphysics. Such an array included ESP, astral projection, telepathy (with or without the [[Mental Radio]]), mental control over the electricity in her body, the Amazonian ability to turn brain energy into muscle power, etc.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G. Peter |title= Sensation Comics|issue= #46 | page=6 | publisher= J.R.

Peter| title= Wonder Woman |issue= #5 | pages=14–15 | publisher= J.R. Publishing Co| date=1943}}</ref>

''Wonder Woman'' #105 revealed that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons, given life and power by four of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] gods (otherwise known as the [[Greek pantheon|Olympian deities]]) as gifts, corresponding to her renowned epithet: "Beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], swifter than [[Hermes]], and stronger than [[Hercules]]", making her the strongest of the Amazons.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> Wonder Woman's Amazon training gave her limited [[telepathy]], profound scientific knowledge,<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> and the ability to speak every language{{spaced ndash}}even [[caveman]]<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> and Martian languages.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #115">''Wonder Woman'' #115 (July 1960)</ref>

Between 1966 and 1967, new powers were added, such as super breath.<ref>{{Cite book | first=Michael L. | last=Fleisher | title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 2: Wonder Woman | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] | date=September 1976 | isbn=978-0-02-080080-4}}</ref>

In the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]] and [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze]] Ages of comics, Wonder Woman was able to further increase her strength. In times of great need, removing her bracelets would temporarily augment her power tenfold, but cause her to go [[Berserker|berserk]] in the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww166.htm |title=Amazon Archives |publisher=Amazon Archives |access-date=December 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112160815/http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww166.htm |archive-date=January 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww229.htm |title=Amazon Archives |publisher=Amazon Archives |access-date=December 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126115624/http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww229.htm |archive-date=January 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

====Post-''Crisis''====
In the Post-''Crisis'' universe, Wonder Woman receives her super powers as a blessing from [[Greek pantheon|Olympian deities]] just like the Silver Age version before, but with changes to some of her powers:<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1 (February 1987)</ref> She is considered one of the mightiest beings in the DC multiverse.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Imgur|title=imgur.com|url=https://imgur.com/HcbDoJy|access-date=2021-07-05|website=Imgur|language=en}}</ref>
* [[Demeter]], the goddess of agriculture and fertility, blessed Diana with strength drawn from the Earth spirit [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]]... Stronger than [[Hercules]]... making her one of the physically strongest heroes in the DC Universe and the strongest female hero in the [[DC Universe]]. This strength has allowed her to even battle [[Superman]] and [[Supergirl]]. She has also held her own against Darkseid. However, now Diana is the daughter of Zeus, king of the Greek Gods, so it is unclear as to how much of her power and strength is a direct result of her divine heritage.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://entertainment.time.com/2013/12/04/and-the-new-wonder-woman-is/|title = And the New Wonder Woman Is...|magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = December 4, 2013|access-date = February 5, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140207212403/http://entertainment.time.com/2013/12/04/and-the-new-wonder-woman-is/|archive-date = February 7, 2014|url-status = live|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Her connection to the earth allows her to heal at an accelerated rate so long as she is in contact with the planet. In rare cases where she has been gravely injured, Diana showed the ability to physically merge with the earth, causing whatever injuries or poisons to be expelled from her body; such an act is considered sacred, and can only be used in extreme cases.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia">{{Cite book | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>
* [[Athena (DC Comics)|Pallas Athena]], the goddess of wisdom and war, granted Diana great wisdom, intelligence, and military prowess. Athena's gift has enabled Diana to master over a dozen languages (including those of alien origin), multiple complex crafts, sciences and philosophies, as well as leadership, military strategy, and armed and unarmed combat. More recently, Athena bound her own eyesight to Diana's, granting her increased empathy.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Johns | first=Geoff | author-link=Geoff Johns | title=Wonder Woman: Land of the Dead | date=February 2006 | isbn=978-1-4177-5102-0}}</ref>
* [[Artemis (DC Comics)|Artemis]], goddess of the hunt, animals, and the Moon, graced Diana with the Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts, meaning Diana can communicate with all animals, including dinosaurs. The Eyes of the Hunter ability gives Diana a full range of enhanced senses, including telescopic vision and super hearing.
* [[Hestia]], goddess of hearth and home, granted Diana sisterhood with fire. This power has been shown to control the "Fires of Truth", which Diana wields through her lasso, making anyone bound by it unable to lie.<ref name="Beatty2003" /> This ability also grants her resistance to both normal and supernatural fire.
* [[Hermes (DC Comics)|Hermes]], the messenger god of speed, granted Diana superhuman speed and the ability to fly.<ref name="Beatty2003">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | title=Wonder Woman: The Ultimate Guide to the Amazon Princess | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | date=November 2003 | isbn=978-0-7894-9616-4 | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwomanultim00beat }}</ref> She is capable of flying at speeds approaching half the speed of light.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia"/>She can react quickly enough to deflect bullets, lasers, and other projectiles with her virtually impenetrable bracelets.

* [[Aphrodite (DC Comics)|Aphrodite]], goddess of love, bestowed Diana with stunning beauty, as well as a kind heart.

While not completely invulnerable, she is highly resistant to great amounts of concussive force and extreme temperatures. However, edged weapons or projectiles applied with sufficient force are able to pierce her skin.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia"/><ref>Jimenez, Phil et al.

She is able to [[Astral projection|astrally project]] herself into various lands of myth. Her physical body reacts to whatever happens to her on the mythical astral plane, leaving her body cut, bruised, or sometimes strengthened once her mind and body are reunited. She can apparently leave the planet through meditation and did this once to rescue Artemis while she was in [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #56, 75, 77, 97 (July 1991&nbsp;– May 1995); ''Wonder Woman Special'' #1 (May 1992); ''[[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall#Requiem|Artemis: Requiem]]'' #1 (June 1996)</ref>

====The New 52====
After the 2011 [[New 52]] relaunch, Diana gained new powers. These new abilities, which included already superhuman strength,superhuman speed, durability, immortality, accelerated healing, and even flight came in addition to her previous attributed Olympian and Amazon combined strength. In addition, Diana's bracelets can now create a thunderous explosion or expel lightning when she clashes them together, however the bracelets are not the source of her power rather it is Diana’s. For any other Amazon user, the gauntlets would not have an offensive ability. Diana can also manipulate lightning and create weapons out of lightning bolts. These new abilities are attributed to being the daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus. Her powers are now considered nearly unmeasurable if she goes without her Bracelets of Submission, which keep her demigod powers in check. She uses these powers in battle against the goddess Artemis and quickly renders her unconscious with ease with a series of carefully positioned counterattacks. While using her godly powers, her outfit and accoutrements lit up and her eyes glowed like her father's.<ref name="thanley.wordpress.com"/><ref name="Wonder Woman"/>{{Better source needed|reason=Wordpress is not 100% legible|date=February 2014}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2017/06/03/wonder-woman-movie-powers-abilities-dceu/|title=Wonder Woman's Movie Powers and Abilities Explained|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619072640/http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/06/03/wonder-woman-movie-powers-abilities-dceu/|archive-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

After becoming the God of War in the pages of ''Wonder Woman'', Diana inherits Ares's divine abilities. Diana has not exhibited her full powers as War, but is seen in ''Superman/Wonder Woman'' #8 slipping easily into telepathic rapport with a soldier, explaining "I am War. I know all soldiers, and they know me."<ref>''Superman/Wonder Woman'' #8. DC Comics.</ref>

====DC Universe====
DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding in December 2017, opting to include everything under a larger DC Universe brand.

===Weapons and other abilities===
==== Pre-''Crisis'' outfits ====
At the time of her debut, Wonder Woman sported a red top with a golden eagle emblem, a white belt, blue star-spangled [[subligaculum]], and red and golden go-go boots. She originally wore a skirt; however according to Elizabeth Martson, "It was too hard to draw and would have been over her head most of the time."<ref name="Wonder Woman">{{Cite book | last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria | last2=Chesler | first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title=Wonder Woman | chapter=Origins preface | publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston | date=1972 | isbn=0-03-005376-5 | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars }}</ref> This outfit was entirely based on the American flag, because Wonder Woman was purely an American icon as she debuted during World War II.<ref name=Cronin26963>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Wonder Woman Throughout The Years|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26963|website=ComicBookResources.com|date=July 2010|access-date=September 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927210000/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26963|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Later in 1942, Wonder Woman's outfit received a slight change{{spaced ndash}}the culottes were converted entirely into skin-tight shorts and she wore sandals.<ref name=Cronin26963/> While earlier most of her back was exposed, during the imposition of the [[Comics Code Authority]] in the mid-1950s, Wonder Woman's outfit was rectified to make her back substantially covered, in order to comply with the Authority's rule of minimum exposure.<ref name=Cronin26963/> During [[Mike Sekowsky]]'s run in the late 1960s, Diana surrendered her powers and started using her own skills to fight crime.

After Sekowsky's run ended in the early 1970s, Diana's roots were reverted to her old mythological ones and she wore a more modernized version of her original outfit, a predecessor to her "bathing suit" outfit.<ref name=Cronin26963/> Later, in 1976, her glowing white belt was turned into a yellow one.<ref name=Cronin26963/> For Series 3, artist Terry Dodson redrew her outfit as a strapless swimsuit.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/costume_indices/wwcost12.html| website=carolastrickland.com| title=Wonder Woman Costume| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612062341/http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/costume_indices/wwcost12.html| archive-date=June 12, 2017| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

A retrospective of Wonder Woman's costume changes was offered in Issue #211, cover-dated April–May 1974, on page 52 which details the changes in her costume from her 1) initial very briefly-lasting one with [[culottes]], or perhaps more specifically, a [[skort]], to 2) the "hot-pants" style costume which would last through the rest of the golden-age years and through much of the 1950s, to 3) the sandaled-look of the late 1950s to mid 1960s, to 4) her plain-clothes civilian look the character adopted during the timeframe of late 1968 to the end of 1972 when the character was without her superpowers, to 5) the slightly-modified-from-the-golden-age costume she returned to when her superpowers were restored in 1973.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #211, page 52, (April–May 1974)</ref>

===== Bronze Age outfit =====
It was late in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]], however, when what is possibly the single-most-significant change in the iconography of Wonder Woman's costume occurred.

In ''DC Comics Presents'' #41, (January 1982), on page 7 of the special Wonder Woman insert, a character identified as "Liz" on the previous page, who states that she is a representative of an organization called the Wonder Woman Foundation, explains "We've been promised full financial backing to promote equality for women everywhere, if we can use your name...and if you'll just wear this charming top from now on, instead of your old one!"<ref>''DC Comics Presents'' #41, special Wonder Woman insert, page 7, (January 1982).

Liz then gives Wonder Woman the new breastplate on which a 'double-W' design replaces the eagle design on the previous breastplate, the first time the breastplate's design had changed in the 40 years of the character's existence. Later on page 14, Queen Hippolyta advises her to "Wear the new halter for a time, at least, for the good it will do." Wonder Woman agrees by saying, "Wait! I just realized...you're right! The cause will make the 'W' stand not just for 'Wonder Woman'...but for women everywhere".<ref>''DC Comics Presents'' #41, special Wonder Woman insert, page 14, (January 1982). DC Comics.</ref>

==== Post-''Crisis'' outfit ====
After ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', [[George Pérez]] rebooted the character in 1987. She wore an outfit similar to her 1970s one, but now with a larger glowing golden belt.<ref name=Cronin26963/> This outfit continued until [[William Messner-Loebs]]' run, which had Diana pass on the role of Wonder Woman to [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]].<ref name=Cronin26963/> No longer Wonder Woman, Diana sported a new black biker-girl outfit designed by artist [[Mike Deodato Jr]].<ref name=Cronin26963/> After [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took over writing and art duties, he redesigned the Wonder Woman outfit (Diana was reinstated as Wonder Woman at the end of Loebs' run) and joined the emblem and belt together.<ref name=Cronin26963/>

Her outfit was not given any prominent change until after the 2005–2006 "[[Infinite Crisis]]" storyline. Similar to her chestplate, her glowing belt was also shaped into a "W".<ref name=Cronin26963/> This outfit continued until issue #600{{spaced ndash}}[[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s run of Wonder Woman's altered timeline changed her outfit drastically. Her outfit was redesigned by [[Jim Lee]] and included a redesigned emblem, a golden and red top, black pants, and a later discontinued blue-black jacket.<ref name=Cronin26963/>

==== ''The New 52'' outfit ====
Another major outfit change for Wonder Woman came about as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of its entire line of publications, [[The New 52]]. The character's original one-piece outfit was restored, although the color combination of red and blue was changed to dark red and blue-black. Her chest-plate, belt and tiara were also changed from gold to a platinum or sterling silver color. Along with her sword, she now also utilizes a shield. She wears many accessories such as arm and neck jewelry styled as the "WW" motif. Her outfit is no longer made of fabric, as it now resembles a type of light, flexible body armor.

Her tiara's signature star symbol is now an eight pointed starburst. According to designer [[Lindy Hemming]] and director [[Patty Jenkins]], every design decision made for [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] came down to the same question: "How would I want to live that's badass?"<ref name="themarysue.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.themarysue.com/wonder-woman-themyscira-image/ |title=New Wonder Woman Image; Patty Jenkins on Costumes |publisher=The Mary Sue |date=March 24, 2016 |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126120648/http://www.themarysue.com/wonder-woman-themyscira-image/ |archive-date=January 26, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> "To me, they shouldn't be dressed in armor like men.

====Invisible Plane====
{{main|Invisible Plane}}
The Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age portrayals of Wonder Woman showed her using a silent and [[invisible plane]] that could be controlled by mental command<ref name="Sensation Comics #1">{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G.

Peter|title= Sensation Comics|issue= 81 | page=5 | publisher= All American Comics| date=1947}}</ref> Its appearance has varied over time; originally it had a [[propeller]], while later it was drawn as a jet aircraft resembling a [[stealth aircraft]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Strickland|first=Carol A.|title=The Invisible Plane/Jet!|url=http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/misc_indexes/jetindex/jet.html|publisher=Carol A.

Shortly thereafter, Wonder Woman is shown being able to summon it with her tiara, have it hover by the War Department, and extend from it a rope ladder with which she could board it. She uses the plane to fly into outer space, and frequently transports [[Etta Candy]] and the Holliday Girls, [[Steve Trevor]], and others. During the 1950s, the plane becomes a jet, and is often shown swooping over Lt. Prince's office; she strips out of her uniform at super speed and bounds to the plane. Though the plane was depicted as semi-transparent for the reader's convenience, in-story dialogue indicated that it actually was completely invisible, or at least able to become so as the need arose.<ref>''DC Comics Presents...'' #41. DC Comics.</ref> Wonder Woman continued to use the Invisible Plane for super speed, outer space, and multi-dimensional transport up until the unpowered era of Diana Prince. When Wonder Woman resumed superpowered, costumed operations in 1973, she continued to use the jet as before, but did glide on air currents for short distances. At one point, Aphrodite granted the plane the power to fly faster than the speed of light for any interstellar voyages her champion might undertake.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #261. DC Comics.</ref>

Thanks to tinkering by [[gremlin]]s, the Plane even developed intelligence and the power to talk.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #312. DC Comics.</ref>

Diana's bulletproof bracelets were formed from the remnants of [[Athena]]'s legendary shield, the [[Aegis]], to be awarded to her champion. The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she-goat, [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], who suckled Zeus as an infant. These forearm guards have thus far proven NIGH-indestructible (the Omega Beams of Grail have proven able to shatter them), and are able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks, allowing Wonder Woman to deflect [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]] fire and energy blasts.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Wonder Woman's Magical Weapons | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=93 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=New York City | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> Diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like Superman's ears bleed.<ref name=WW219 /> Recently, she gained the ability to channel Zeus's lightning through her bracelets as well. Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation, because they were once part of the Aegis, and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #39 (February 2010)</ref> After the 2011 relaunch of the character, it was revealed that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta<ref name="Clay"/> and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she had inherited from Zeus in check.<ref name="Wonder Woman"/> In addition, Hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow Wonder Woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet. Each sword, marked with a red star, takes shape from a flash of lightning, and when Wonder Woman is done with them, the swords disappear, supposedly, back into her bracelets. As such, she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows, spears and energy bolts among others.<ref>Azzarello, Brian (w), Chiang, Cliff (p), Chiang, Cliff (i). Wonder Woman (vol. 4) #15. DC Comics.</ref>

The inspiration to give Diana bracelets came from the pair of bracelets worn by Olive Byrne, creator William Moulton Marston's research assistant and lover.<ref name=Lepore/> "Wonder Woman and her sister Amazons have to wear heavy bracelets to remind them of what happens to a girl when she lets a man conquer her," quoted Marston in a 1942 interview. "The Amazons once surrendered to the charm of some handsom Greeks and what a mess they got themselves into. The Greeks put them in chains of the Hitler type, beat them, and made them work like horses in the fields. Aphrodite, goddess of love, finally freed these unhappy girls. But she laid down the rule ("Aphrodite's Law") that they must never surrender to a man for any reason. I know of no better advice to give modern day women than this rule that Aphrodite gave the Amazon girls."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://joshua.hamman.org/2009/04/wonder-woman-1942-interview-w-william-moulton-marston/|title=Wonder Woman 1942 interview w/ William Moulton Marston|date=April 7, 2009}}</ref>

====Lasso of Truth====
{{main|Lasso of Truth}}
The ''Lasso of Truth'', or ''Lasso of Hestia'', was forged by [[Hephaestus]] from the golden girdle of Gaea.<ref name="Beatty2003" /> The original form of the Lasso in the Golden Age was called the Magic Lasso of Aphrodite. It compels all beings who come into contact with it to tell the absolute truth and is virtually indestructible;<ref name="Beatty2003" /> in ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', [[Green Arrow]] mistakenly describes it as "the only lie detector designed by Zeus." The only times it has been broken were when Wonder Woman herself refused to accept the truth revealed by the lasso, such as when she confronted [[Rama Khan]] of Jarhanpur,<ref>''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #62 (March 2002)</ref> and by [[Bizarro]] in [[Matt Wagner]]'s non-canonical ''[[Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wagner | first=Matt | author-link= Matt Wagner | title=Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity | publisher=DC Comics | date=July 1, 2005 | isbn=978-1-4012-0187-6}}</ref> During the Golden Age, the original form of the Lasso had the power to force anyone caught to obey any command given them, even overriding the mind control of others; this was effective enough to defeat strong-willed beings like [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''War of the Gods'' #1 (September 1991).

Diana occasionally uses additional weaponry in formal battle, such as ceremonial golden armour with golden wings, [[pteruges]], chestplate, and golden helmet in the shape of an eagle's head.

<!--Please keep these concise; redirect details to "Cultural impact of Wonder Woman"-->
[[Feminism|Feminist]] icon [[Gloria Steinem]], founder of [[Ms. (magazine)|''Ms.'' magazine]], was responsible for the return of Wonder Woman's original abilities. Offended that the most famous female superhero had been depowered into a boyfriend-obsessed [[damsel in distress]], Steinem placed Wonder Woman (in costume) on the cover of the first issue of ''Ms.'' (1972) – [[WarnerMedia|Warner Communications]], DC Comics' owner, was an investor – which also contained an appreciative essay about the character.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|editor1-last=McAvennie|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Dolan|editor2-first=Hannah|chapter=1970s| title=DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle| publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |page=154|quote="After nearly five years of Diana Prince's non-powered super-heroics, writer-editor Robert Kanigher and artist Don Heck restored Wonder Woman's... well, wonder."|isbn=978-0-7566-6742-9}}</ref> Wonder Woman's powers and traditional costume were restored in issue #204 (January–February 1973).<ref name=autogenerated2 />

However, Steinem disapproved of Wonder Woman being out of costume, and the controversial story line never happened.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/colloquy/download/colloquy_issue_twenty-four_/matsuuchi.pdf |title=Wonder Woman Wears Pants: ''Wonder Woman'', Feminism and the 1972 'Women's Lib' Issue| first=Ann |last=Matsuuchi| journal=Colloquy: Text Theory Critique| issue=24 |year=2012|publisher=archived at [[Monash University]]}}</ref>

The original significance of Wonder Woman had the intentions of influencing many women of all ages, displaying the physical and mental strengths, values, and ethical attributes that not only men acquire. "Wonder Woman symbolizes many of the values of the women's culture that feminists are now trying to introduce into the mainstream: strength and self-reliance for women; sisterhood and mutual support among women; peacefulness and esteem for human life; a diminishment both of 'masculine' aggression and of the belief that violence is the only way of solving conflicts," Steinem wrote at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2016/10/12/wonder-woman-75-how-superhero-icon-inspired-generation-feminists?cid=inbody:wonder-woman-new-trailer-goes-deeper-into-dianas-backstory|title=Wonder Woman at 75: How the superhero icon inspired a generation of feminists|work=SBS Movies|access-date=April 12, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413080743/http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2016/10/12/wonder-woman-75-how-superhero-icon-inspired-generation-feminists?cid=inbody:wonder-woman-new-trailer-goes-deeper-into-dianas-backstory|archive-date=April 13, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Wonder Woman stars in multiple films and is most commonly known for her red, white and blue one piece, and her tall, sexy assertiveness.

After the release of the 2017 film ''Wonder Woman'', critics examined the character's status as a feminist figure in the film. Zoe Williams for ''[[The Guardian]]'' said, "Yes, she is sort of naked a lot of the time, but this isn't objectification so much as a cultural reset: having thighs, actual thighs you can kick things with, not thighs that look like arms, is a feminist act. The whole Diana myth, women safeguarding the world from male violence not with nurture but with better violence, is a feminist act. Casting Robin Wright as Wonder Woman's aunt, re-imagining the battle-axe as a battler with an axe, is a feminist act. A female German chemist trying to destroy humans (in the shape of Dr Poison, a proto-Mengele before Nazism existed) might be the most feminist act of all."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/05/why-wonder-woman-is-a-masterpiece-of-subversive-feminism|title=Why Wonder Woman is a masterpiece of subversive feminism|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=2017-06-05|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Alyssa Rosenberg for ''The Washington Post'' said, "...{{nbsp}}None of these experiences crushed me, of course, but I do wonder what it might have been like if they hadn't happened.The power of Wonder Woman, and one of the things that gives Jenkins's adaptation of the character such a lift, is in the answer to that question. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) doesn't have any idea what women and men are — or aren't — supposed to do. Even when she does encounter other people's ideas about gender roles, she doesn't automatically accept them, and she never lets anyone stop her. And the movie goes a step further and argues that it's not merely little girls all over the world who stand to gain if they can grow up free of the distorting influence of misogyny: a world like that would be liberating and wonderful for men in lots of ways, too."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/06/05/wonder-woman-is-a-beautiful-reminder-of-what-feminism-has-to-offer-women-and-men/|title='Wonder Woman' is a beautiful reminder of what feminism has to offer women — and men|author=Rosenberg, Alyssa|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> Emma Gray for ''[[HuffPost]]'' said, "When it comes to pop culture, we speak often about representation; the simple yet often unfulfilled idea that it matters to see someone like you fill a variety of imagined roles on screen.

William Marston's earliest works were notorious for containing subversive "bondage and sapphic-undertones" subtext. Among Wonder Woman's famous catchphrases, "Suffering Sappho", was a direct reference to lesbianism. [[Fredric Wertham]]'s ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' referred to her as the "lesbian counterpart to Batman" (whom he also identified as a homosexual). After Marston's death in 1947, DC Comics downplayed her sexuality and feminist origin. Wonder Woman, without Marston's creative direction, become more "traditional" superhero fare; the lesbian relationships and sexual imagery disappeared from the "Wonder Woman" comic, along with Wonder Woman's super powers. During the [[Comics Code Authority]]-decades since, Wonder Woman's subversiveness had been gradually stripped away; subsequent comic book writers and artists either didn't know what do with her or barely hinted at Wonder Woman's erotic legacy.<ref name="ReferenceA">Professor Marston and the Wonder Women</ref>

But under the new 1987 re-boot of the title, under the editorship of [[Karen Berger]], and with the writing and art of George Perez at the helm of the book, the same-sex appreciation by Wonder Woman and the Amazons was more than hinted-at and this was established quickly in the new run of the title. Upon her first sight of supporting character Vanessa Kapatelis (in issue #3), she is shown smiling upwards at Kapatelis, thinking to herself "I've never ''seen'' another woman quite ''like'' her...she's so ''young''...so ''vulnerable''...so ''beautiful''..."<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #3, page 18, panel 5 (April 1987)</ref> Three years later, in the first issue (#38) of a new decade, there is a story-line presenting a cultural exchange between appointed leaders from 'Man's World', who are the first mortals to visit Themyscira in this continuity, and the Amazons of Themyscira, in Themyscira, itself. The guest [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, Reverend Cantwell, asks the Amazon [[Mnemosyne]] "..."Don't you ''miss'' the ''sharing'' God intended for the sexes?" to which Mnemosyne replied "''Some'' do. They have sworn themselves to Artemis, the virgin hunter, and Athena, the chaste warrior. ''Others'' choose the way of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]. But ''most'' of us find satisfaction in each ''other'' -- three thousand years ''can'' be a long time, reverend.".<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #38, page 7, panel 6 (January 1990)</ref> Probably more than at any other time in the then nearly fifty-year history of the character, the Amazons were explicitly and unequivocally defined, in general, as lesbian. Additionally, Kevin Mayer, brother of the major supporting character Myndi Mayer, was openly gay and this was treated sympathetically.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) Annual #1, pages 39-40 (January 1990)</ref> By this time, DC Comics was a [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]-owned company, and had been for over 20 years.

In 2016, "Issue #48" of ''[[Sensation Comics]]'', featured Wonder Woman officiating a same-sex wedding, drawn by Australian illustrator Jason Badower. "My country is all women. To us, it's not 'gay' marriage. It's just marriage", she states to [[Superman]]. Inspired by the 2015 [[Obergefell v. Hodges|June Supreme Court ruling]] that established [[same-sex marriage]] in all 50 United States, Badower says DC Comics was "fantastic" about his idea for the issue.

Wonder Woman's signature weapon is her Lasso of Truth; consequently, much of her crime-fighting powers came from bondage, and her only exploitable weakness was, essentially, bondage. Grant Morrison and Yanick Paquette had teamed up to work on ''Wonder Woman: Earth One''.<ref name="fanbros.com"/>

Wonder Woman's [[BDSM|sexual and bondage themes]] in her earliest days were not without purpose, however. Her creator, William Moulton Marston, theorized that human relationships could be broken down into dominance, submission, inducement and compliance roles which were embedded into our psyche. Because males were, more often than not, dominant in societies, Marston believed that "Women as a sex, are many times better equipped to assume emotional leadership than are males."<ref>{{cite book|title=Wonder Woman Unbound : the Curious History of the World's Most Famous Heroine|first=Tim|last=Hanley|isbn=9781613749098|oclc=859187727|date=April 2014}}</ref> Marston wanted to convey his progressive ideals, through his use of bondage imagery, that women are not only capable of leadership roles, but should be in charge of society. Although Marston had good intentions with these themes, in Wonder Woman's early appearances, the bondage elements were controversial, as they were often seen to overly fetishize women in power rather than promote such women. Noah Berlatsky criticized this imagery in Wonder Woman's earliest days noting that "the comics take sensual pleasure in women's disempowerment."<ref>{{cite book|title=Wonder Woman: New Edition with Full Color Illustrations|first=Noah|last=Berlatsky|oclc=1078908120}}</ref> Despite having the mixed messages of this imagery, Marston fiercely believed that women would soon rule the earth and meant to showcase his predictions through sexual themes in his stories. He was an open feminist while studying at Harvard where he once said "Girls are also human beings, a point often overlooked!"<ref>{{cite book |title=The secret history of wonder woman |first=Jill |last=Lepore |publisher=Vintage |year=2015 |isbn=9780804173407 |oclc=941724731}}</ref>
