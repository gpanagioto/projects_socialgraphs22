God  How the fuck did this happen?! I told you to leave me alone, Mackey!  I'm not in the mood! Uh, not at all. Please uh, have a seat, Mr. Garrison. Uh, please have a seat, Mr... President. Certainly want to uh, congratulate you on the election. I know we've had some differences, uh... I'm sorry that your position here at the school was terminated.
