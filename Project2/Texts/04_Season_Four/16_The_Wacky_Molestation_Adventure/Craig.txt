 What? You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?  This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line. Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line. Craig. It's Spaceman Craig.   Take ''that'', kindergartners!  Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them. I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
