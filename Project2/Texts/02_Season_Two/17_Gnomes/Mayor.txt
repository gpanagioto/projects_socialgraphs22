You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world? Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet? Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always ''tell'' people you are. Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country. Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do. So I guess you wanna do some campaigning. <br>  Alright, what's next.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band ''every''one likes, like uhhhh, like... Like Toto. And then the Harbucks guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.
