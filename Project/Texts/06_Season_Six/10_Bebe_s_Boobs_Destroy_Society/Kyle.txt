I can't wait to watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' with Bebe.  Hoh hoh hoh! Is Bebe home? What the hell are you doing?  Bebe, I thought we were going to watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' today. Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs? But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me. Boobs are stupid!
