Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tour. I'm Elon Musk. Are we gonna have some fun today? And getting anywhere takes ingenuity. Oh, Mrs. Door? Would you mind... opening, please? The only way for humankind to survive is with imagination and technology. Cars that run on electricity. Solar panels that replace roof shingles. Even food that changes form. You see this? It's a pizza, only four inches long. And yet, when heated, it expands to make enough pizza to feed a hundred people. I call it the pizza... pocket. Who would like to see the Hyperloop? A new mode of travel that can take you from here to Dubai in nine minutes. Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets. They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on Earth for reuse.  Well, I certainly wanna thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group. Give yourselves a round of applause. Mars? We're still about ten years away from going to Mars. Maybe eight. Well I'm sorry, but it's a bit more complicated than a pizza pocket. Going to Mars is gonna take a lot of very smart people working very hard for a very long time. Now, if you don't mind, I have hundreds of more tours to do.  Like... how funny?
