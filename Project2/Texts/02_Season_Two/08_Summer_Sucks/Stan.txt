Shut up, Pip. Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks. I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt. Jesus, Cartman! The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass. So, we'll have ten M-80s, please. Heard what? How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore? A summer without fireworks is likeâ€¦ I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass. Man, it's hot out here. I know! Let's go sledding! Come on, Cartman, get on. What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman? What the hell is going on? Hi, Uncle Jimbo. Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year. Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer? Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison. That's good. Right. Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard. Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool. Whatever, dude. But Cartman, we're trying to-- What does he mean, "living in denial"? There, how does that look? Uh, crap..! He's taking swimming lessons. How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman? Yeah, they need to shut it off. Oh, my God! They killed Kenny! Man, this sucks. We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help. Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves. How many days left in summer? Dammit! I just want it to snow again! Hi, Uncle Jimbo. There's nothin' to do. Hey, look! We blew up the snake! Winter's back! Well, I can hardly wait. Hey, Chef!
