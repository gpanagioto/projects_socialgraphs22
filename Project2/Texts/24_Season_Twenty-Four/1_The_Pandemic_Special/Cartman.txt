Yes, teacher, I'm here. I can't wait to start  schoo... schoo... schoo... oo... oo... Oh no? Can you guys hear me? I just said eh... eh... eh... eh... <poem><i>I'm cut off from the world, isolated, alone. This is what I can existencing. No one can touch me or boss me around. Social distancing-</i></poem>   Yeah Social distancing, Mom.  Computer keeps freezing, Mom. Maybe, if you were an essential worker, we could afford faster Internet. Oh, what a folly a shower seems when my generation is being denied their lives. I can't see my friends. I can't even go to school. How I miss Kyle. Heh heh heh heh. What... the fuck... are you talking about? We can't go back to school: there's a fucking pandemic. They can't do that! Oh no, I see! There's all this horrible stuff going on in the world, but apparently, Cartman's life doesn't matter!   Dude, you are not gonna believe this.  Is your dad home, Kyle? We need to talk to a lawyer! Mr. Broflovski?! They're gonna try and make us go back to school. Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle! They want us to go back. To school! "So?" What the fuck is-? You really wanna go back to that slavery?! You crazy, psychotic... Kyle, we need to get a lawyer to stop schools from forcing us back! Now, whatever your messed-up beliefs are about "wanting to go to school" You don't have to be on Zoom, there's a million ways around it! Mark my words, Kyle: first they'll force us back to school, then they'll take social distancing away from us completely, and I'll be out of my room having to hang out with you!  Oh my God. They won't get away with this! Pandemic! There's a pandemic! You can't make me go to school!  You can't! Argh! Araraaagh! Nonono! Nonono! You can't make me! You hear me?! You can't make us stay here! This is a violation of our freedom! Who's with me, guys?! Oh my God, I forgot how much it sucks to be around everybody! I think I'm gonna be sick, all over Kyle!  This is bullshit!  Stan's right. If we want things to go back to normal, we have to do it ourselves. I sure as hell will! The way it was! Online, in our own rooms! Wait, what? What normal are you talking about? I'm talking about normal, like three days ago, when everything was awesome. Without any employees? What, do you expect us to just, just... build our own bear? Stan, you really need employee assistance with this. Oh no! You're not ending this pandemic!  ''Your'' only chance! For ''your'' normal, not ''mine!'' I am ''not'' going back to school!
