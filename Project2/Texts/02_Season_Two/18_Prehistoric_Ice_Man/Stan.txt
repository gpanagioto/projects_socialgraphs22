Holy crap. dude! This guy rules! Yeah! Dude! Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle! Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!  Can you climb back up, dude? Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him. Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch. Sorry.  All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? He's like, some frozen guy. Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.  You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!  Help me chip some of the ice away. Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward? Where shall we bring it? I think I'm going to name it Gorak.  ''You'' didn't find him, ''I'' found him. You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out. Huh, excuse me? I found this frozen guy in the woods today. Really. Wait a minute! His name is Gorak! Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak. No, it isn't! I'm not being a dick, ''you're'' being a dick! No, ''I'll'' go! I found him! Oh my God, they revived Gorak. Uh, hi. He said, "hi." He wants to know where he is. You're... home. Dude, you've been frozen 32 months. Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had ''me'' talk to him. Oh yeah? Well ''You're'' not ''my'' best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now ''my'' best friend! Fine!  He doesn't look very happy in there. I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!  You guys aren't being very nice to my creature. Let him out, dude. He's scared.   Gorak! Gorak! Are you there? I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out. What are ''you'' doing here? What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak. His name is Gorak! Gorak! What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!  No he doesn't!! I found him, I'm rescuing him! You're a dick! You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you! Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!  Dude, ''Terrance and Phillip'' is on at 3. I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy! You suck as a best friend, Cartman!  What are you doing, Gorak! Wow, that sucks, dude. What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock! Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick! Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is ''my'' responsibility. ''I'll'' take him to Des Moines! Come on!  We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please. My friend, Gorak! ''No'', he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole! Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock. 'K. O-okay. 'K   Ow! Watch my coat, dude. Huh?   No problem, Gorak. Yup.  Right on. His... name... is... Gorak! They're after you!  Where's Gorak??  Wait, look! The helicopter! He's alive! Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
