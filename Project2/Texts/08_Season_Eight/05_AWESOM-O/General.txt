Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this. The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler.  No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon! Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before ''we'' do... You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  I want that robot! Are those arm and leg locks secure? Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on.  What's going on?  Stand by. Be ready to destroy it. What's happening? What? How can that be? Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist! Who made you, robot? But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?  Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too. Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  What the hell are you doing?! Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!  Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart? Oh, and it, it smells, too! Wow, kid, you're a little faggot!
