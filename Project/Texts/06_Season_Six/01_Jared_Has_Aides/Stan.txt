Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches! Hey Kenny. We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny!  What kind of help? I'll bet you can. Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.  Then City Wok could say ''their'' food makes them lose weight. He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster. ''Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls.'' Marry him?  Chef, we need more food.  Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed. How do you feel, Butters? Alright, now it's time for phase 2. We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world. Did you bring the camera? That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches. Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!  Did you eat only one ounce of City Wok like we told you?! All prepared for liposuction surgery?  Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault. We've gotta hurry this up.  He's losing weight.  Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home. Dude, bail!  Come on, Butters. Time to go. What? ...Kenny would have done it. Alright, it's settled. Come on, Butters.  That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared! What?! Wait. Everyone ''hates'' Jared now? Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out.  No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has ''assistants''. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides. Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials? Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!  Oh God-damnit! Why? Well, so much for our money.
