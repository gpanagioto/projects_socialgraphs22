Oh, well, hello there, children. Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on. Now, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it? ...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. ''Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh'' Wait! What the what?! Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.  ...Wait, what? Sea people? Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.  Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men. Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  Relax, children, drinkin' some  brine shrimp can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else. Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.   Hello there, children! Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode. Good for you!
