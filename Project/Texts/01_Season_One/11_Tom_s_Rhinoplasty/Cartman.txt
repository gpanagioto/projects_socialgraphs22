 That is so-ho lame! Oh man, I... Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.  Wow, she's pretty.  Yes, ma'am. Noh, he always pukes when he's in love. She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me! Until you puked on her. I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners  Memememememe, me! What's a multiplication table? We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen. Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!  Good-bye, Ms. Ellen. I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home. Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell. Nuh-uh! Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing! Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. Oh, hi, Chef. You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian. I am, too! My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet. This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian! I'm a bigger lesbian than you! Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. Dang! That's nice! Oh, weak, dude! Did you make love? No way! That's not what ''we'' just heard! What the hell...? Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
