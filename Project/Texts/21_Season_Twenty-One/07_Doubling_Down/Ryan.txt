It's getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it's time we put our foot down. Well whattaya mean? He's great. We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don't get to see all his good qualities. Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that's just, that's doorknob cum. Okay, we're safe to talk. Sshh, keep your voices down! Look at this! The latest approval ratings. I've been researching our own independent poll. The President is tanking. These numbers are so low that we just might have an out. Well, don't you guys see what this means? It means that the swing voters are turning against him. It's those people that matter. Those are the ones who can finally turn this thing around! Nothing! Oh, you bitch!  I was the one who researched the poll, Mr. President! Congratulations, Mr. President.
