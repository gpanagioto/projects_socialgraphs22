'''Wonder Boy''' is the name of two fictional characters who have appeared as [[superhero]]es in comics published by [[Quality Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. The original was an alien who appeared in ''[[National Comics (series)|National Comics]]''.<ref name=Companion>{{cite book |last1=Koolman |first1=Mike |last2=Amash |first2=Jim |title=The Quality Companion |date=2011 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490373 |pages=202â€“203}}</ref> The second was a time-traveler from an alternate future who appeared in ''[[Team Titans]]''.

== History ==
As most of the stories with him in them were only six pages long there was never much revealed about him other than that he was known for: having the strength of a thousand men, a girl friend named Sally Benson and a tendency for bombastic speeches.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=296}}</ref>

Deciding to help the people of Earth fight crime and evil (most specifically Hitler) his first act shortly after getting out the meteor and hearing about Hitler was to swim to Europe and bash a few fascists, he was soon called Wonder Boy by the public at large, otherwise he had no other name or a secret identity, and apparently never wore anything but the costume he was "born" wearing.

==Quality Comics==
'''Wonder Boy''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Quality Comics]] character and [[superhero]] who first appeared in ''[[National Comics (series)|National Comics]]'' #1 (July 1940), in the story "The Boy from the Meteor". The character was created by writer [[Toni Blum]] and artist [[John Celardo]].<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/wondrboy.htm Wonder Boy] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]</ref>

With "the strength of a hundred full grown men", the nameless Wonder ''Boy'' fell to Earth from the planet Viro, destroyed when it "collided" with a star.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=36}}</ref> Finding himself in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], he joined forces with Sgt. Crane of the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] and began using his superhuman abilities to fight the [[Nazis]], [[Axis powers|Axis]] spies and big-city crime. Cheering him on from the sidelines was sweetheart Sally Benson, an earth girl.

Wonder Boy last appeared under the Quality Comics banner in ''National Comics'' #26 (November 1942), in an untitled story.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/174 |access-date=8 April 2020 |page=175}}</ref> The character reappeared two years later in Elliot Publishing Co's ''Bomber Comics'' (along with several other characters that originally appeared in ''National Comics'').

==DC Comics==
===Team Titans===
The second '''Wonder Boy''' debuted in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #19 (April 1994) published by [[DC Comics]]. He appeared in the past along with several other Titans from an alternate future. They assisted the Team Titans on a mission, and afterwards the group decided to remain in the past. Shortly after the mission, [[Donna Troy]] addressed the [[Justice League]] assembly (led by [[Wonder Woman]]) and announced the United States government made a deal to allow the future Titans to remain in the past and act as paranormal operatives led by a government-appointed supervisor. During his next mission with the Titans, Wonder Boy teamed with [[Aqualad]], [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], [[Mirage (DC Comics)|Mirage]], and other Titans for an undersea mission.<ref>''Team Titans'' #19-22, 24</ref>

During the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' storyline, the alternate future where the Team Titans originated from is erased from continuity, and all the characters from the alternate future are erased from existence.

In the story, Bobby is a fan of Wonder Woman and follows her around for a day. At the end of the story, Wonder Woman presents him with a "Wonder Boy" t-shirt and invites him to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] for a celebration.
