==Fictional character biography==
===''Spider-Verse''===
Peni's father acted as the original pilot of the SP//dr mecha, in which he protected New York from crime and other dangers. After his mysterious death, Peni is approached by her [[Aunt May#Spider-Verse|Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Uncle Ben]] to become the new pilot of the SP//dr. In order to do so however, she has to be bitten by the sentient radioactive spider which controls part of the suit. Soon after being bitten, Peni becomes the new protector of the city. Five years later, she battles her universe’s version of [[Mysterio#Spider-Verse|Mysterio]] - an obsessed fanboy of hers. Peni eventually teams up with her universe's version of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] – who had known her father – to battle a group of criminals before being approached by [[Spider-Ham]] and [[Alternative_versions_of_Spider-Man#Old Man Spider (Earth-4)|Old Man Spider]] to join the Spider-Army to fight the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]].

===''Spider-Geddon''===
After the events of "[[Spider-Verse]]", Peni is approached by a girl named [[Eddie Brock|Addy Brock]], who wonders if she was really the SP//dr pilot. Peni ignores her, but Addy retorts by saying she is not as special as she thinks. At home, Peni tries to talk to Ben and May about being special, but she gets ignored. While improving the SP//dr's web shooters, she notices Addy walking in the base and follows her; only to find another mech-suit similar to the SP//dr, only in black and powered by a sym-engine called [[Alternative versions of Venom#Spider-Geddon|VEN#m]], with Addy as its pilot. Peni becomes furious at her aunt and uncle for not telling her about this. When a [[kaiju]]-like creature named [[Morbius the Living Vampire#Spider-Geddon|M.O.R.B.I.U.S.]] starts to drain the city's electrical energy, SP//dr goes after it, but is quickly defeated. In order to defeat M.O.R.B.I.U.S., Peni's aunt and uncle send VEN#m to defeat the creature. It is successful, but the creature causes VEN#m to malfunction; causing the mech suit to attain sentience and consume Addy. When May flies in to fix the problem manually, it consumes her as well. SP//dr confronts VEN#m, but the black mech suit overpowers her until she uses her improved web shooters to defeat it. However, she is too late to save her Aunt May and Addy, who have vanished from inside the suit. Following the battle, Peni and Ben have a heart to heart, but Spider-Ham re-appears to recruit Peni to help defeat the Inheritors once more during the events of ''[[Spider-Geddon]]''.
