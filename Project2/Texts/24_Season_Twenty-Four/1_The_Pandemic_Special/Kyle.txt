Hi. What are you doing here?? Dude, get out of my house! If you wanna talk, we can go outside!  So? I want an education! I want to be able to compete for a job when I get older! You really wanna spend the next year on Zoom? You're out of your room hanging out with me now! Fuck you!  Hey dude. You think he got the virus? I know. This bullshit sucks. But Butters will be okay. You really think it's that bad? Who else can we call, Stan? Okay! Dude, we made it. A mustache?  Come on, dude. We'd better get outta here before we're spotted. What do you mean? And then do what? Dude, you need people to help you do the stuffing and the closing. You don't- you don't actually build your own bear. Dude, just let it go.  Stan, are you sure this is about Butters? 'Cause you seem really desperate to build a bear. Hey!  I don't believe it.
