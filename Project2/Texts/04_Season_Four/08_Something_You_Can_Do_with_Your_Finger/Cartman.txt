<poem><i></i></poem> Yes! Yes! I'm a star! ''I'm a star!'' I'm--   God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million. Boy band. Boy band. There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God! That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over! Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it-- So? What?  Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!  Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.  We'll let you know, Butters. Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off! Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd ''better'' do it better than that.  Next! Kyle's brother? Christ's sake..!  Next!  Next audition!  '''''Goddammit, NEXT!'''''   No way! Okayokay, fine. ''Wow'' me. Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh.  Dude, she's a ''chick!'' "Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?!  Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up! Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse? We have to rehearse all that we can!  My mom made us costumes! Yeah.  'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.  ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not-- You can't ''be'' the tough one because you're Jewish! Since when?! Alright, fine! Here!  I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.  Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang" mean, then? ...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!  Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up! We're goin' to see the mall manager.  Oh, God, I can't see!    Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir! We... are Fingerbang! We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall. Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition? Alright! Let's do it, boys!  <poem><i>--you're my fantasy, you fanta--</i></poem>  Well, so can we play here? No?? Why not?! You don't think we're any good, do you?! Well, come on guys. We gave it our best.   Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems. I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  What's the Gomlich effect? So how do boy bands use that? Thanks! Okay.   Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay? I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera.  Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck.  Waitwaitwaitwait, ''cut!'' Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio! Fine! Who would you go crazy for? ...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer. Roll camera! '''''Jesus Christ!''''' Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and ''show him what we've got!'' Oh uh, Kyle has it.  Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine.   Hello again! I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.  Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool.  Son of a bitch!  You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease. Really? You will? That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock? Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed!  Aw, Mom! Where the hell is Stan?! I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will '''''have his nuts!''''' Yes. Yes, sir, any secondâ€”we're just waiting on one more member. Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him. Oh, god-dammit! God dammit! People are walking away!  Just another minute.  Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard. Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name!   Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please? We will!  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...  No! He can't be dead! No! We were so close! But we have to perform! Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang! Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes! Ok-Okay, okay. Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us. I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd ''wanna'' become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!" Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.
