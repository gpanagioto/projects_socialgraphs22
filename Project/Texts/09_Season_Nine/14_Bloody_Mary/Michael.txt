As most of you know I once lost my job and my family because of my drinking. But with the help of AA I've been sober for ten years now.  Anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups, for starters? That's great. And I understand this is somebody's ''first'' AA meeting, is that right? ''[Randy points to himself]</> Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself. Randy, you are powerless to make that decision. The only thing that works is the 12-step program.  Step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking. Only then can you move on to the other 12 steps, like, believing that only a higher power, God, makes you stop drinking. And then, turning your life over to that God and, humbly asking God to remove your weaknesses.  Well it's not religious. You just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness. That's the 12-step program, not religion.  You just can't cut down on your drinking, Randy. You need to know something. You have a disease. That's right. Alcoholism is a disease. You're sick, Randy. You're very very sick. And just like with most diseases, you can't cure it yourself. And it's deadly. None of us are in charge. We're all powerless. He can't quit by himself. None of us could. He needs divine intervention. Spirituality. Young man, do you know anything about the 12-Step Program? Sure Randy, go ahead. Randy, uh what are you doing?
