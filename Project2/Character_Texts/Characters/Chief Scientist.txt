Y-yes, we've been able to trace the virus and confirm that it did, in fact, come from a seedy part of China. And, in fact, we've pinpointed the virus to a certain bat in Wuhan. What we still don't understand is, how did a transmitted disease get from a bat to a human? How can a virus jump species like that? We just don't know. Yes, now that we have the animal in our possession, we'll finally be able to unlock what caused a virus to jump from it to humans. Nono, the virus did not come from a bat. We were able to break down the virus enough to see there was actually no bat involved. When we tracked the virus, we found it did originate in Wuhan, but from a species called pholidota. It's a pangolin. And here it is, right over here.   You see, this pangolin's DNA has mutated, which is what we believe started it all. We're not completely sure, but we believe now that something somehow... got its DNA up into the pangolin. Well i-it's almost like another creature somehow inserted its DNA up into the pangolin. Again, what really matters is that we decode the foreign DNA inside the pangolin. That would be the key to the vaccine, perhaps even a cure. We have to know what raped the pangolin. Excuse me, sir. Who are you?  This tour is for scientists that specialize in pandemics. Are you... a pandemic specialist? Uh-kay. Anyway, if you all follow me now to the micro labs, I can show you the containment system for once a vaccine is able to be tried.  Yes. You see, what we needed was the foreign DNA that was up inside the pangolin. It's whatever that DNA was that was our key to the cure.  Now we have hope. We've learned that we might never get back our old lives, but by working together, we just might find a new way to-
