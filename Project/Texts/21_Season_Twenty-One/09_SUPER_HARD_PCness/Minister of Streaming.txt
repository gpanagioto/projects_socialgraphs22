Thanks for having me, buddeh. Well, they're pissed off because their country sucks, so they wanna point the finger at us. So you thought it was funny, but now it's not funny? Oh, so you want to censor it. Uh huh, you sound like a Jewish mother. Now I resent that! I find that racist- You are a racist, fwiend, and if you have a problem with Canada, maybe you should speak to your backwards President! 'Kay, go ahead! Oh, sure you do! Just like all Jewish moms, 'cause you don't understand how- Can I finish?! That's not a- Can I finish, please?! Please, can I finish?!  Alright, I'm finished. Mr. President! You need to do something about your millennials! Terrance & Phillip are Canada's largest export! They account for 80% of our gross national product! If your citizens mess with them, they mess with all of us! Third-world country?!  Now you listen here, Mr. Buddeh! Either you stop the embargo on The Terrance & Phillip Show, or we'll bring in our own troops to stop it ourselves! I'm simply telling you that Canada will do what it must to protect itself!
