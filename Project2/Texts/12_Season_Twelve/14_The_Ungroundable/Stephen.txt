You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?! I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go! What keeps a family together, Butters?! That's right!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right! You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?! There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?!  Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister!  That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?! All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah! Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now! Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  Uhh, Bu-Butters? AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!  All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!  He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground. What? That's right son. There's only one thing I care about. Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?! Butters, you are grounded! It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more.
