I think I know how to fix this! We drill. I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill. We got into this mess by drilling heuh  Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.  Oh, she'll take it.  Sorry.
