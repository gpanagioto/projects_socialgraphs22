I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives! What, fatass?! You got your what? Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right!  Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out ''my'' ass. Dude, did you get your period yet? Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty. Yeah. You got ''your'' period too, Kenny? Ike, can I talk to you?  Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't! Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore. Yeah! I could just ''say'' I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just ''say'' I got my period, 'cause I really ''will'' get it someday! It's not ''really'' lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.  Thanks a lot, Ike!  You guys! I got my period, too! Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place. Awesome! We get powers?  Here. I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde. Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m. Nothing. Um  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.  Phew.  Hormones? Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones. Whoa, dude!  Hey, here comes Stan. Did you get your period yet, Stan?  How do know that?
