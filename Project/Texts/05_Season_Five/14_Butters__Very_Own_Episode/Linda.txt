 Oh, you! Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.  Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.  Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.  Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say? Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around? Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary? A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself. Wait a minute. What was the movie called? Oh my God... Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie? To the gym?  Gaah!  ...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!  Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!  Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint. I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Must be made clean. New.  Paaiint.  Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now. No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.  Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you? And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best. If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert. I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.  Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon. "Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-" Stay away from me, bastard!  You don't know anything!  Then why, Chris, why?! Well,  There is no going back, Chris! No!  Our son is dead!  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!  Just go away and let me die!  I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now!  No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us. Puerto Rican. He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me. Yes, I... remember hearing something about that. Thank goodness. Oh. Sure. I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story! Don't forget: your lies started all this.  Butters?? Oh, Butters! Oh, my baby's back! Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home. Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?! You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!  You sure are. No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive. We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.  And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im. We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
