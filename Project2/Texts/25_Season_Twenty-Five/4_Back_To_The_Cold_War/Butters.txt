Hi, Josslyn! Hi, Staci Mae! Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! I'll do my best, Dad! That kid? Oh, Jesus! Not Melancholy!  Well, I dunno!  What is what?  Oh, geez! Put that thing away, Melancholy! Hello, sir. I just needed to talk to somebody. I've been having some problems at home. Well, it's just my parents. You see, a few months ago, I saw this little girl riding a pony and I said, "Whoa! I wanna do that!" So we found a stable and a trainer, and I started to learn dressage. And I got to lease a pony, and his name is Melancholy. Well, I love to ride Melancholy. But now I'm feeling all this pressure to win. My parents said I have to win because it's against the Russians. It's the Russians. I mean, I guess they're just really good at dressage, but now my dad says it's a matter of national security. Don't move my head? I â€“ Well, o-okay, but I kind of am asking you for help, ya know, because I'm feeling really lost and miserable. Well, they said if I don't do well at dressage, it could mean the end of all of our freedoms. We need to have a serious talk, Melancholy, and I need you to listen.  That's it! You got it, boy! Nope! Nope! Melancholy! Over the jump, boy!  Melancholy, back to the jump! Whoa, Melancholy, Whoa!! W-What are you doing now? Now I'm not sure what's going on here.  No! No! No! Melancholy! Bad pony! I'm sorry, ma'am! Melancholy, to the jump! This is it, Melancholy. We have to do this. We have to be classy. We're not gonna poop, we're not gonna get a boner, and we're certainly not gonna have unwarranted sex with the ladies. Please, boy... we have got to get this right. It's ok, Melancholy...we did our best... Whoa! Where you goin', Melancholy? Melancholy! Bad!  Waaaghhaaagh!
