They look so delicious.   Memememee! Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious. Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too? Alriiight!  No, Uncle Jesse, no!  What? What the hell are you guys doing?? Where are we going? What? Why? So? Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass", "butthole", and "douchebag". I really don't feel like you guys's friend.   Oho! So you ''need'' me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering Playset! Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass.  Just give it a little kiss and I'll help. Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it. Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it. No, it has to be Kyle.   Oh man, that was soho awesome! Hell, I'm not goin' with you!  Heeeey!    You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset. Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off. O! At least I ''have'' an ass, Jew! See? Maybe they ''want'' to become sweet juicy veal steaks. I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood. Eh!  Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling.  Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer. I want out. Yeah! Wait-what?  Oh, God-damnit you guys. We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?! Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again. Can't go on. Need... food... There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf. All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters.  Food! Look you guys! Beef jerky! Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy. Go ahead, that's more for us.  Who's the hungry man? Hippies! What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!  Talk to me Mike. Sure, sure. What do you have in mind? Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike. All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -  We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye. Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.  Hello. All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf.  Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?!  We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here!  Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else!  Mike, speak. We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us? Good, good. Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike. And Worf? Step back! Tell those men to step back!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, and you must refer to me as "Captain." No. See, you must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?" You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.  "Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"  Okay, all set! Step on it, Mr. Worf!  Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!  "Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?" Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.  Oh, it's a double-cross!! What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf! Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are! Thank God we stopped it in time.
