Boooriing. No, ''I'' found it. No, ''I'' did, Pip. Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as ''you'' can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead. Okay, ready? I'll go first. Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! Eeyy! Give me that back! We'll ro-sham-bo for it! ANTHROPOLOGIST! I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!  Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! ...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan! Screw you, triangle thief! Eeyy! Oh I'll find it, don't worry! God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously. I was just ''setting it aside.'' Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do! Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it. Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him? What's that noise? Aaah! Aliens! No! I found it, he stole it! I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief. Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!  You scared the ''crap'' out of me, Ike! ''I'm trying to get my tri''- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back? Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddamn son of a bitch!! Huh?! Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with ''my'' triangle, now that it is ''mmyy'' triangle. Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers! Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as ''you'' can... It is? Yeeh, stealth bombers. Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen- Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! No, not when money is involved, stupid! Ugh. Let me go! Seriously! Eey! It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's! Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh. I don't remember. No! Don't! AAAAAA! AAAAADUH! WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand! Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is, it's inside my shoe. I suppose ''your'' socks smell like the Botanical Gardens! Yes! She stole my triangle! Make it go away! I ''hate'' Barbra Streisand! I ''hate'' her! Sweet! No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now! Huh? Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah! Thanks for your help! Visit us again! No! That's ''my'' walkie-talkie, he gave it to ''me!'' Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll ro-sham-bo you for it! Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass! Oh no! She's back!
