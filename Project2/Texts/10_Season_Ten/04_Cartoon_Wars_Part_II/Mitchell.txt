Oh hi, Miss Travis.  Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now. All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny.  You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff. Well, here we are. Danny, the ''Family Guy'' writing staff. They're manatees.  Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea. They really are brilliant creatures.  Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect ''Family Guy'' joke! I can see it now! When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you.  Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees. That isn't gonna work on them. Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats. We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working. No sir, none of us did.
