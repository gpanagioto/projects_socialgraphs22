Dr. Valerie Cooper received an entry in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #2.

She appeared sporadically as a secondary character, often an antagonist, in various Marvel series through the 1980s, primarily ''Uncanny X-Men'' (written by Claremont) and ''Captain America'' (written by [[Mark Gruenwald]]). When writer [[Peter David]] and artist [[Larry Stroman]] took over ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' in 1991, they added Cooper as a major character, and she was featured in the majority of the series until its cancellation in 1998.

The character reached additional prominence in the mid-2000s, appearing in dozens of issues in 2006 at the height of Marvel's "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" and "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" events. Also in 2006, Peter David returned to write a relaunched ''X-Factor'' and eventually featured her in the series during the period 2007-2009. In the 2010s she made few appearances.

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Valerie Cooper was originally a special [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] on national security issues, which include metahuman affairs. Originally, Valerie Cooper took a hard-line concern on the problem of the threat that superhumans and mutants posed to the [[United States]].

===Freedom Force===
This position changed slightly when Valerie Cooper oversaw [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s team, the former [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], which operated as government agents under the new name of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. Around this time Cooper was also involved in a project to create government sponsored superheroes which resulted in the creation of the second version of Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter) as well as three villains that would become her enemies Deathweb. Carpenter would subsequently be assigned by Cooper to join Freedom Force.

Meanwhile, Valerie Cooper and the Commission were directly involved in the events of the government demanding the identity of [[Captain America]] under the argument that he was their property. With Steve Rogers giving up the identity of Captain America, Cooper supervised the recruitment of [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]] and [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]]. The two of them became the new Captain America and the new [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], respectively. Valerie Cooper's next duty was to hire [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], to create a machine to detect mutant powers.

The Freedom Force project was shut down when several members were killed while others were missing after being abandoned in [[Kuwait]]. During the [[Muir Island Saga]], Cooper's mind fell under the control of the [[Shadow King]]. Valerie was ordered by the [[Shadow King]] to shoot [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] but fought the command and ended up turning the gun on herself.  Val was critically injured, but survived. Mystique, with the aid of [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] hypnotists, went undercover as Val in an attempt to foil the [[Shadow King]]. It wasn't until the defeat of the Shadow King, by the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], that Mystique and Cooper were able to return to their own lives.

===X-Factor===
After witnessing first-hand the deeds of mutants throughout the years, Valerie Cooper wanted to give the concept of a government sponsored team another shot. She was able to convince several members of the X-Men and their associates to form a new X-Factor team.  This new team, composed of [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and [[Strong Guy]] replaced Freedom Force, with Val acting as government [[wikt:liaison|liaison]] to the team. Val is assisted by the human employee Baldrick.<ref>''X-Factor'' Annual #7 (1992)</ref> Soon after Val was once again mentally controlled, this time by the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. Val was freed from the Acolytes' control, but her relationship with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] was damaged when it was revealed that she knew of [[Project Wideawake]], a new [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] project being developed by the U.S. Government. Cooper later decided to hand leadership of the team directly to [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]. With the world getting more dangerous around her and the departure of some of the members, Cooper was forced by the government to allow Mystique and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] to join. With Forge in command, the team went underground.

===Commission on Superhuman Affairs===
Cooper returned to the Commission on Superhuman Affairs. In her position, she found herself helping the X-Men out on several occasions. She was later responsible for taking [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] away to a government facility following the [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] incident. Valerie was instrumental in helping the old [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] defeat [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] and negotiated for the team their Presidential [[Pardon]].

===O*N*E===
Cooper helps establish the [[Office of National Emergency]] (or O*N*E), an official government branch dedicated to preparation and defense against superhuman threats; not much later, she becomes its Deputy Director. The O*N*E, with its first line of defense being the [[Sentinel (comics)#Sentinel Squad O*N*E|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]], becomes responsible for the mutant refugee camp established at the [[X-Mansion]] after most of the world's mutants are depowered during the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] event. Many mutants join the camp willingly while some are secretly coerced into it.

With the destruction of the X-Mansion and the X-Men's subsequent move to San Francisco, O*N*E no longer watches over the X-Men's day-to-day activities nor does it guard them with Sentinels.
