You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time. You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?!  Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Tolkien and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me? No way. I'm last? Last? I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class? The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy. Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I-I didn't think I was the very ugliest. Oh God! I do?  Ah! Ike, Ike, you ''have'' to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me! Hello.  Yeah.  No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly! No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.  They all laugh at me!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face. Who said that? Abraham Lincoln? But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now. Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home! I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!  That should just about do it.  All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this! Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity! Huh?? Stan, what is going on?! So what number was I?? She's gonna kill us? I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
