 So what of it?! No! No, this is my life now, Harrison Yates! I started over, with me own saved game! See for yourself. I built a house with John Marston! I'm helpin' his family now!  A basic starter horse and the $20 gambler's that you won at a poker match! I'm twice the man you are now! I'll talk however I want!  I'm not tellin'! You wanted your now life and now you got it!
