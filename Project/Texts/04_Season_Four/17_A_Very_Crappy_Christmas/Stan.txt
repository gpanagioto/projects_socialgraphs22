 A-ah huh. Ho-o-oh. What is this all about, Kyle? I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore. Nobody's paying any attention.   This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas. Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing.  How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?  And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this. What, dude? We don't know anything about animation. Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas"  It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.  Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!  That's not me, that's you!  Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending. Hey! Wait a minute! Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?  You guys, knock it off! We have to record this!  What's awesome? That's not ''in'' the script They do this all the time. Easy. Uhd- W, ''WW-e'' wish you a Merry Christmas Okay.  One. Kickass! Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas.   E mouths...  2. "We wish you a m- Merry" AAAAAAAA! That took us half an hour to set up, fatass! We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it! Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a ''miracle'' to finish this thing! <poem><i>We love</i></poem> <poem><i>Tralala</i></poem> <poem><i>We sit.</i></poem> <poem><i>Tralalalala</i></poem> "Awgh! I'm so fat!"  "Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!" '''Cartman:''' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew!  <poem><i>We wish</i></poem> <poem><i>Tralalalala</i></poem> <poem><i>We sit.</i></poem> <poem><i>Tralalalala</i></poem> ...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film.  Hey! Wait a minute! Aren't you Jewish, Kyle? ''(voice rising)'' Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas! You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs! For nothing. Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing.  No not ham! ...Christmas is about something much more important!  Presents. Don't you see, Kyle? Presents. Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head. Wow! Count me in!
