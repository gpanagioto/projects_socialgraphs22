-----


The kids are gathered on stage at one end of South Park Elementary's gym.

Class


We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year!



-----


Stan steps forth from the choir and heads towards center stage.

Stan

Lights, please.

-----


The lights dim. He steps into the spotlight and quotes from the Gospel of Luke (2:8-11,14).

Stan


And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,
keeping watch over their flocks by night.
And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them,
and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them,
'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy,
for born unto you this day in the city of
...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace,
goodwill towards men'

And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus.

-----


Stan steps aside while presenting the Nativity scene. The curtains open, and nine students stand in and around the grotto. Kenny is the angel floating above the manger, Wendy is Mary, about to give birth; Kyle is Joseph, ready to receive Jesus; Cartman is one of the three shepherds on the left side of the stage, and three Wise Men stand on the right side. Wendy is simulating birth pangs.

Wendy

Unh [labored breathing] Oh!

Kyle

Come on, Mary! Push!

Wendy

Aaaah!

Kyle

I can see its head!

Wendy

UUuuhh-UUuuhh.

-----


A doll pops out beside Mary and flips through the air. Joseph catches it.

Kyle

It's a boy!

-----


Unfortunately, he's now holding the doll wrong.

Cartman

Oohhhh!

Kenny

(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)

Mr. Garrison

Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you?

Kyle

...Sorry.

Mr. Garrison

And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains.

Wendy

Okay.

-----


Sheila approaches Mr. Garrison.

Sheila

Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!

Mr. Garrison

Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head.

-----


Mary and Joseph are now looking at them argue.

Sheila

How dare you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?!

-----


Kyle drops his head.

Mr. Garrison

...So?

Sheila

So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?

Mr. Garrison

Because it's Christmas???

Sheila

Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas.

-----


All the kids gasp.

Mr. Garrison

Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you?

Sheila

Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!

Cartman

Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!

-----


Kyle shoots back.

Kyle

Shut up, fat boy!

Cartman

I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.

Stan

Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?

Mr. Garrison

Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?

Sheila

How about the dreidel song, bubbe?

Kyle

I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...

Mr. Garrison

The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?

Kyle


Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-



Stan

Christmas Poo?

Cartman

What the hell is Christmas Poo?

Kyle

Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?

Sheila

Kyle, that is enough!

Mr. Garrison

See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan.

Sheila

Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.

-----


Mr. Garrison interrupts and follows her

Mr. Garrison

Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark?

-----


Wendy gets up.

Wendy

You guys, look! It's snowing!

-----


Snow is seen through a window. The kids step out of costume and rush out of school to take advantage of this opportunity, cheering all the way.

-----


In the school playground.

Stan

Whoa, Christmas snow!

Wendy

Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.

-----


A soft instrumental starts up.

Wendy

It's fun.

-----


The kids shuffle back and forth catching snowflakes. When Kenny looks up an eagle passes overhead and dumps a load - right on Kenny's face.

-----


Cartman is watching with glee.

Kenny

P'tooui.

Stan

That was sick, dude!

-----


Cartman seeing Kyle lolling for a snowflake.

Cartman

Hey!

-----


Kyle is taken aback

Cartman

What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!

Kyle

We can, too!

Stan

...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.

Kyle

Officer Barbrady!

Officer Barbrady

What?

-----


A car screeches to a halt as Officer Barbrady raises his arm.

Kyle

Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?

-----


After a long pause.

Officer Barbrady

Yyess.

Kyle

Damnit!

Stan

Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.

Cartman

Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.

Kyle

No. But I get Hanukkah presents for eight days.

Cartman

Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.

Stan

We'll catch up with you later, Kyle.

-----


Stan walks off with Wendy and the others.

Kyle

Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.

Stan

Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?

Kyle

Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.

Cartman

Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now.

Kyle

Well! You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!

Cartman

You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle.

-----


Cartman and walks away.

Stan

See you around, dude.

-----


Stan follows Cartman away.

-----


Kyle is left alone in the playground as winds howl around him. The camera zooms in on him as the intro to his song plays.

Kyle


It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas...



-----


He walks away, then peeks at the mall from behind a tree. Stan is on Santa's lap while Cartman and Kenny wait in line, now forming on Santa's left.

Kyle


Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas.




-----


He walks down the road, past a Toy Shoppe and a stand of Christmas trees. The camera pulls back as he walks out of view.

-----


Outside City Hall a crowd gathers.

Mayor McDaniels

Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down.

Large woman

Mayor, we are deeply offended by the Nativity scene in front of the capital office. Church and State are separate!

Some men

No! Wrong!

-----


Kyle appearing among his friends.

Kyle

What's going on, you guys?

Stan

The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet.

Sheila

That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!

Mr. Garrison

You are the Jewish community!

Crowd

Yeah! Yeah!

Cartman

Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!

Kyle

Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

Father Maxi

Mayor, the Nativity is what Christmas is all about. If you remove Christ, you must remove Santa and Frosty and all of that garbage, too!

-----


The crowd cheers in agreement.

Woman

Hallelujah!

Man

Amen!

Tree hugger

And we must put a stop to the cutting down of Christmas trees!

Man 1

Raah!

Man 2

Give me a break!

Uncle Jimbo

And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids. If you don't want to spill your coffee, you shouldn't be driving with it.

-----


The crowd processes Jimbo's words.

Crowd

Yeah! Yeah!

Mayor McDaniels

Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise. Perhaps we need a new icon for Christmas.

Assistant 1

Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor!

-----


The crowd mulls over the suggestion.

Kyle

Hey! How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?

Mayor McDaniels

Ex-cuse me?

Kyle

Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.

Sheila

Kyle! Sshhh!

Kyle

It's true. He doesn't care what faith you are. 
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-



Cartman

[stopping Kyle] Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy.

Kenny

(Kyle's crazy!)

Stan

Yeah.

Sheila

Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww.

-----


Sheila drags him away.

Kyle

Wait...

Mayor McDaniels

Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions?

-----


Mr. Garrison raises his hand.

Mayor McDaniels

Yes, Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?

-----


Looks back, then.

Mayor McDaniels

No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans.

Mr. Garrison

Rats!

-----


Kyle's house, the living room. Ike opens up his present - a dreidel. He gives it a spin. The camera pans to the right and stops at Kyle and his dad.

Gerald Broflovski

It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!

-----


Sheila pops out from behind Gerald.

Sheila

Your father's right, Kyle.

Gerald

Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!

-----


Sheila pops out again.

Sheila

Listen to your father, Kyle.

-----


The dreidel has gone off to the right, and Ike goes after it, bumping into the coffee table. The Channukah menorah on it (day 6) falls on Ike, and he begins to burn.

Gerald

Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'.

Kyle

But dad, he always sh...

Gerald

Say it!

Kyle

There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.

Gerald

Again!

Kyle

There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.

-----


Sheila pops out again.

Sheila

This is for your own good, bubbe.

Gerald

Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!

Kyle

[softly, under his breath] Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.

Gerald

What did you say?!

-----


Kyle enters his room.

Kyle

I said Ike's on fire!

Ike

Oh oh. On flame? Oh oh. On flame?

Sheila

OH MY GOD!

-----


Gerald quickly smothers Ike with a blanket to douse the flames.

-----


Kyle's house, the bathroom. He is brushing his teeth.

Kyle

It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast!

-----


A voice is echoing from the toilet

Voice

Kyle.

-----


Kyle faces the toilet, then returns to brushing his teeth.

Kyle

I'm not hearing that.

Voice

Kyle.

-----


Kyle hops down and goes to the toilet, then looks into it.

Kyle

Mr. Hankey?

-----


Mr. Hankey pops up and makes his entrance wearing white gloves and a red elf cap.

Mr. Hankey

Howwwwdy-hoooo.

-----


Mr. Hankey jumps onto the sink.

Mr. Hankey

Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell.

Kyle

[now wary] Go away, Mr. Hankey.

Mr. Hankey

You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers.

Kyle

I said go away! My father said you aren't real.

Mr. Hankey

Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song?

-----


He begins to sing. As he does so, he skips around the room and leaves bits of poo behind.

Mr. Hankey


Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'.



Kyle

Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.

Mr. Hankey


Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'.



-----


He leaves 'NOEL' written in poop on the vanity mirror.

-----


Gerald knocks on the door.

Gerald

Kyle, what are you doing in there?

Kyle

Nothing.

-----


He knocks again.

Gerald

Open this door!

Mr. Hankey


I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...



Kyle

Mr. Hankey, come here.

-----


Kyle grabs Mr. Hankey and muffles him, and turns as Gerald opens the door. Gerald sees a bathroom smeared with feces everywhere, and a boy facing him holding a big piece of it in his left hand. He gasps and remains speechless.

Gerald

KYLE!

-----


Kyle throttles the poo.

Kyle

Say something, Mr. Hankey!

-----


It falls over, and Kyle looks forsaken.

-----


Kyle's bedroom. Kyle is now in bed.

Gerald

Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!

Sheila

Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?!

-----


Gerald looks towards his room and quickly closes the door.

-----


Mr. Hankey is now on Kyle's comforter.

Mr. Hankey

Howdy-ho!

Kyle

Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?

Mr. Hankey

You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold.

Kyle

Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.

Mr. Hankey

Aw, gee, that's too bad.

Kyle

Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.

Mr. Hankey

Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas.

Kyle

Yeah! We'll show them!

-----


Kyle smiles, pleased with the idea.

-----


Downtown South Park.

Mayor McDaniels

Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!

-----


The crowd sets about dismantling the decorations. A man removes Santa's head from his sleigh and tosses it onto the street.

-----


Uncle Jimbo calls forth from his shop.

Uncle Jimbo

Is mistletoe offensive?

Mayor McDaniels

Is anyone offended by mistletoe?

-----


One man raises his hand.

Mayor McDaniels

Lose the mistletoe!

-----


Jimbo clips it off.

-----


Bus stop.

Stan

You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!

Cartman

How do you know?

Stan

'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.

Cartman

Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.

Stan

What's that?

Cartman

I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.

-----


Kyle arrives.

Kyle

Hello, everybodyyy.

Stan

What's in the box, dude?

Kyle

It's a surprise.

Cartman

Let me see!

-----


The boys gather around the box.

Kyle

O-Okay. But don't scare him...

-----


A shot of what Mr. Hankey sees as Stan pops the lid open, then a top-down view as the poo is shown in all its glory. Cartman and Stan blink.

Stan

[angrily] Dude, sick!!!

-----


Kyle looks down at his poo.

Cartman

Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?

Kenny

(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)

Kyle

Wait! You guys! He's alive!

-----


Kyle jostles the box.

Stan

Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.

-----


Kyle is shaking the box now.

Kyle

Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!!

-----


Research Center, a Researcher is shown before at least six subjects.

Researcher

Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready?

-----


The group looks back at him.

Researcher

Here we go: Christ

-----


Two responses.

Researcher

Hm. Okay. Cherub.

-----


No response.

Researcher

Hm... Camel

-----


One response.

Researcher

Hm. Sad.

-----


No response.

Researcher

Stupid Wop Dago.

-----


All respond.

Researcher

Bench...

-----


South Park Elementary, the school gym. The janitors are clearing out the decorations.

Mr. Garrison

Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?

Janitor 2

Mayor's orders.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus.

Cartman

Thanks to Kyle's mother.

Kyle

Shut up, Cartman!

Mr. Garrison

So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.

-----


Cartman raises his hand.

Mr. Garrison

Yes, Eric?

Cartman

How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.

Kyle

I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

Cartman


O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch,
she's a big fat bitch,
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch,
if there ever was a bitch,
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.



Kyle

Shut up, Cartman!

-----


Mr. Hankey pops to life.

Mr. Hankey

Howdy-ho!

Kyle

[hushed] Mr. Hankey.

Cartman


Monday she's a bitch,
on Tuesday she's a bitch,
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different,
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!



-----


The class is clapping along gleefully by now, while Kyle looks at Cartman with ire.

Mr. Hankey

Golly, that isn't very nice.

-----


Kyle turns to hear him.

Mr. Hankey

I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.

-----


Mr. Garrison joins in the clapping, but he's off beat.

Cartman


Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom? 
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BIIIIII-I-I-ITCH - aahh.



Kyle

Mr. Hankey, no!

Mr. Hankey

Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!

-----


Mr. Hankey attacks Cartman.

Mr. Garrison

What the... 

-----


The poo is now on the floor, and the class gasps.

Cartman

Gross, Kyle!

Mr. Garrison

Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric?

Kyle

Uuuuuuhh...

Cartman

YOU SICK BASTARD!

-----


Some snickers are heard.

-----


The counselor's office, the window showing silhouettes of Kyle and Mr. Mackey. Another student waits outside.

Mr. Mackey, Jr.

Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?

Kyle

I don't have a problem.

Mr. Mackey

Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.

Kyle

What's that?

Mr. Mackey

Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.

Kyle

Mookie-stinks?

Mr. Mackey

Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?

Kyle

Wull, not on purpose.

Mr. Mackey

So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya?

Kyle

Well, sometimes...

Mr. Mackey

And that must make you mad.

Kyle

Well sure.

Mr. Mackey

Mad enough to kill, Kyle???

-----


Mr. Mackey looks at him up close.

Kyle

No, dude!

Mr. Mackey

Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?

Kyle

But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...

Mr. Mackey

Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have.

-----


Mr. Mackey sips from his coffee cup, Mr. hankey is now bathing in the cup.

Mr. Hankey

Kyle!

-----


Kyle lowers his head.

Mr. Hankey

Howdy-ho.

-----


Kyle is shocked.

Mr. Mackey

Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?

-----


Kyle looks back up in horror at the counselor, who takes another sip of coffee. Kyle closes his eyes in dread anticipation. Mr. Hankey is still bathing in Mr. Mackey's coffee.

Mr. Hankey


Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way...



Mr. Mackey

To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac...

-----


Mr. Mackey notices the poo in his cup and gasps.

Mr. Mackey

Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey!

-----


Kyle's mouth is twisted with chagrin.

-----


South Park Elementary, the school gym. Christmas lights are still hanging and lit.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy...

Students

Hhmm.

Mr. Garrison

...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?

-----


a low faucet is dripping next to the outlet, creating a puddle that goes past it. The class looks at the sight, then Kenny goes over...

Mr. Garrison

 Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.

-----


Kenny tugs at the cords and they come out. He looks at the class, then walks back to his spot.

Mr. Garrison

 Okay. Now let's practice our...

-----


Mr. Mackey rushes in, followed by Kyle.

Mr. Mackey

No! Get away from me!

Kyle

Here. Just look more closely at it.

Mr. Mackey

No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?

-----


South Park Mental House.

Stan

Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.

Nurse

Reason?

Kyle

I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.

Nurse

Any allergies?

Kyle

No.

Nurse

Jacket!

-----


Two burly men come out through the doors on either side of the nurse and wrap Kyle up, then take him inside, chattering all the while.

Cartman

Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!

-----


South Park Elementary, the school gym.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on?

-----


They do, and just look back. The camera now looks out to the audience.

Artsy Man

Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down.

His Date

Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great!

Sheila

Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it.

-----


Sheila is now sobbing.

-----


South Park Mental House.

Kyle


Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...



-----


South Park Elementary, the school gym. The MC is on stage.

MC

Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday...

Man 1

[pointing] Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage. That's very offensive to non-Christians.

Uncle Jimbo

Oh, come on!

Man 1

Hey! Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!

Randy Marsh

I agree.

-----


Mr. Garrison peeks through the curtain.

Mr. Garrison

Oh brother.

-----


He steps back.

Mr. Garrison

Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?

-----


Kenny approaches the ladder and starts climbing.

Mr. Garrison

And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there.

-----


Kenny looks down at the pool.

Kenny

(Hunh?)

-----


He looks back at Mr. Garrison.

MC

Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef.

Chef


I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights.



-----


Kenny reaches the star and makes sure he's safe.

Chef


You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
You can break my heart, and that means...



Stan

I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him.

Chef


...We should make love,



Cartman

Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.

Chef


...'Cause if we don't-



Mr. Garrison

Okay, kids, get ready to take your places.

-----


The crowd cheers.

MC

Thank you, Chef!

-----


Kenny finally descends with the star.

Kenny

(Phew!)

MC

And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!

-----


Philip Glass moves into position and start playing his keyboards. The curtains draw back, and the kids look out at the audience. They begin to move around.

Voice-over

As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes.

-----


A track saying "Happy Happy Happy, Everybody Happy" is added, along with an arpeggio. Members of the audience look confused.

Voice-over

How like a turtle the sun looks.

Sheila

What the hell is this???

-----


The kids just keep moving and turning.

Sheila

This is horrible!!!

Father Maxi

This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!

Mr. Garrison

You're the ones who made it this way!

Father Maxi

Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian.

Gerald

It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!

Elderly Tree Hugger

All you bastards ruined Christmas!

-----


The crowd descends into brawling. A person in blue is thrown towards the stage. The Broflovskis trap Father Maxi.

Gerald

Get him in the ribs!

-----


Sheila punches Father Maxi.

Father Maxi

Oof.

-----


Picking up the elderly tree-hugger.

Man in audience

Damn tree-hugger!

-----


Tosses him away.

Stan

This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.

Wendy

Yeah.

-----


Chef is now on stage behind the children.

Chef

Say, where's Kyle?

Stan

We committed him.

Chef

What? Why?

Cartman

'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.

Chef

Chirstmas poo? You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.

Stan

Huh?! O-oh.

-----


The crowd continues to brawl. Sheila uses a chair on her husband, who quickly falls to the floor. She watches him fall.

-----


A Mr. Hankey Commercial Plays.

-----


Back at the gym. The man in blue is thrown from his post for the third time - an obvious blooper, as the Broflovskis have Father Maxi trapped again.

Stan

This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!

Chef

Well! You can believe in him now.

-----


A woman backs up across the stage as a man flies towards her. The crowd is more violent now.

Woman

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH.

Stan

I believe.

-----


A piano begins to play softly.

Wendy

I believe in Mr. Hankey.

-----


A shoebox at one side of the stage starts to jump, and the lid pops off. Mr. Hankey jumps up and floats in the air, surrounded by pixie dust.

Mr. Hankey

Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!

-----


Everyone on stage gasps.

Mr. Hankey

Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery.

Cartman, Stan

Whoa!!

Mr. Hankey

Howdy-ho, Chef!

Chef

Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!

Cartman

Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!

-----


Moves toward stage left.

Cartman

Talking poo is where I draw the line!

Mr. Hankey

What's all the ruckus?

Chef

I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey. The whole town is about to kill each other.

Mr. Hankey

I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!

-----


He sees the crowd fighting and whistles. They stop and turn to see him.

Mr. Hankey

STOP FIGHTING!!

The Mayor

Oh my God, what the hell is that thing?

Mr. Hankey

Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies".

-----


Father Maxi finally gets up from the floor as a single person begins to clap, and the crowd turns to see that the person clapping is Gerald. Then others start clapping and the town begins to cheer. Mr. Hankey is overjoyed at the response.

Stan

Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

-----


South Park Mental House. Kyle sits on the floor of a padded room.

Kyle


I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...



Mr. Hankey

Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!

-----


Thinking it's a hallucination.

Kyle

Oh no, I'm not sane yet!

Mr. Hankey

I brought some friends with me.

Kyle

Friends?

-----


Kyle gets up and looks lout a small window. He sees all the townsfolk and smiles, relieved.

Townsfolk

Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!

Kyle

You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy?

-----


The nurse releases him and he rushes out the door. Mr. Hankey follows.

Townsfolk


Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo...



-----


Mr. Hankey kisses Kyle.

Townsfolk


...he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you...



-----


Mr. Hankey begins tossing presents to everyone.

Townsfolk


...Even if you're a Jew



Mr. Pirrip


Sometimes he's nutty, sometimes he's corny,
he can be brown or greenish-brown
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
he might come to your town



Townsfolk


Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me. I love you
Heeeeeeee Looooooves Yoooooouu!



-----


Mr. Hankey, during the second chorus.

Mr. Hankey

Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas.

-----


He floats up to meet Santa as he passes by.

Cartman

Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!

Santa Claus

Howdy-ho ho ho!

Stan

You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too.

Kyle

Yeah...[concerned] You know, it seems like something's still not right.

-----


The camera pans over to Kenny.

Cartman

Yeah, something feels...unfinished.

-----


Drum roll.

Stan

Wh-what could it be?

-----


The drum roll heads for a climax.

-----


THE END.

Kenny

(Yee he hee!)

-----


End credits roll.

-----


South Park Public Access. A light is on.

-----


Jesus is on the Jesus and Pals set alone.

Jesus


Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...



-----


Jesus blows out the candle on his cake and ends up in the dark. He blinks. Credits resume rolling.
