It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now.  But Baby, I love you! I need you! You can't break up with me! Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you.  Those sneaky snakes in the grass! Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them! So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every  last one of you! Oh Charlotte?  Honey? Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle? this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right!  wieners! No!  We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us?  Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours! I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind,  or are you with Uncle Kyle.   We walk together in peace! We walk together in peace! We're not poor for feeling ashamed in who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out! Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow nice because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing! What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry! Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are! You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple! Good for you, Uncle Kyle!
