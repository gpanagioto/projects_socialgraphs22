Following Jack Larson's portrayal on The Adventures of Superman TV series, Olsen was promoted from office boy to "cub reporter" beginning in Superman #86.<ref>Superman No. 86/2: "Jimmy Olsen ...Editor!"

[[Lucy Lane]] debuted as Jimmy's off-again, on-again love interest in issue #36. Jimmy and Lucy were occasionally married in "imaginary stories" such as ''"''The Wedding of Jimmy Olsen" (issue #38) and ''[[Superman Red/Superman Blue|The Amazing Story of Superman Red and Superman Blue!]]''

==== The [[Mort Weisinger|Weisinger]] Era ====
Early adventures saw Olsen in a variety of [[slapstick]] adventures and strange transformations, such as Jimmy transforming into the giant "Turtle Boy" in issue #53. The stories in the title often featured particularly outlandish situations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/best-jimmy-olsen-comics/ |title=The 10 Most Insane Jimmy Olsen Moments of All Time |first=Chris |last=Sims |date=September 29, 2010 |publisher=[[Townsquare Media|ComicsAlliance]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421051151/http://comicsalliance.com/best-jimmy-olsen-comics/ |archive-date=April 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |quote=With 163 issues of outright madness, ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' somehow managed to out-crazy every other DC comic in the Silver Age. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/12/18/the-twelve-best-covers-of-supermans-pal-jimmy-olsen/|title= The Twelve Best Covers Of ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen''|first= John|last= Rozum|date= December 18, 2012|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140410072519/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/12/18/the-twelve-best-covers-of-supermans-pal-jimmy-olsen/|archive-date= April 10, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> ranging from Jimmy being hurled back in time to [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] before its destruction in issue No. 36 to dealing frequently with [[gorillas in comic books|gorillas]] of all sorts.

As Elastic Lad, he was an honorary member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes (1958 team)|Legion of Super-Heroes.]] When traveling to the Bottle City of Kandor, Superman and Jimmy donned the secret identities of [[Nightwing]] and [[Flamebird]], respectively. He was promoted by editor Perry White to the status of "full-fledged reporter" in issue #124 (October 1969.)

''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' was a best-seller throughout the 1960s; at its peak it was the #4 best-selling comic book with an estimated 520,000 copies sold each month.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Comic Book Sales Figures for 1961|url=https://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/postaldata/1961.html|access-date=2021-07-04|website=www.comichron.com}}</ref> Reprints from the magazine were also featured in [[80-Page Giant]] #2 and #13 (1964–65).

====Jack Kirby's Fourth World====
{{main|Fourth World (comics)}}

[[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] storyline began in Jimmy Olsen comics in 1970, with issue No. 134.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsfromme.com/2003/08/22/jack-kirbys-superman/|title = News from ME - Mark Evanier's blog}}</ref> Kirby began by introducing a secret "[[Project Cadmus|D.N.A. Project]]" to create Mutated Humans for Good, adding "the Hairies" (a group of technology-equipped hippies), superbeings from other planets (proto-New Gods), [[Intergang]], [[Darkseid]], and the WGBS media executive [[Morgan Edge]]. Kirby also used the series as a vehicle to reintroduce [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] characters that he previously created at DC Comics, such as [[Guardian (comics)|Guardian]] and the [[Newsboy Legion]].<ref>McAvennie, Michael "1970s" in Dolan, p. 141 "Since no ongoing creative team had been slated to ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'', "King of Comics" Jack Kirby made the title his DC launch point, and the writer/artist's indelible energy and ideas permeated every panel and word balloon of the comic."</ref> Before the end of his run, Kirby wrote stories involving [[vampire]]s,<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= The Man from Transilvane|title= [[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]|issue= #142|date= October 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= Genocide Spray|title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen|issue= #143|date= November 1971}}</ref> the [[Loch Ness Monster]],<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= A Big Thing in a Deep Scottish Lake|title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen|issue= #144|date= December 1971}}</ref> and Victor Volcanum, a fire-eating archcriminal.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Mike Royer|Royer, Mike]]|story= A Superman in Super-Town|title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen|issue= #147|date= March 1972}}</ref> A two-part story featured the comedian [[Don Rickles]]. Kirby left the series following issue #148.

=== Superman Family (1974-1982) ===
With issue No. 164 (April–May 1974) the series was renamed ''[[The Superman Family]]''.<ref>McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 159 "DC's 100-page Super Spectaculars were proving popular, so DC said goodbye to ''Supergirl'', ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'', ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'', and housed the characters together in ''Superman Family''. Continuing the numbering from where ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' ended, the series featured classic reprints with new tales in the lead spot."</ref> An anthology title that incorporated the recently cancelled series [[Supergirl]] (Volume 1) and [[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]], ''Superman Family'' initially featured one new story about Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, or Supergirl, with the featured character in each issue narrating reprints of the other characters' stories. By the second series, Jimmy Olsen became an [[investigative reporter]] for WGBS-TV nicknamed "Mr. Action," featuring in urban crime stories that less frequently involved Superman. Olsen appeared in new stories in ''The Superman Family'' No. 164, 167, 170, 173, 176, 179, and 182–222. A number of Superman writers including [[Leo Dorfman]] and [[Cary Bates]] contributed scripts for the stories, and they were most often pencilled by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]. The series ended with issue #222 (September 1982). Afterwards, Jimmy Olsen continued to appear in issues of ''Superman, Action Comics, World's Finest Comics,'' and [[DC Comics Presents]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jimmy Olsen (Silver Age) Chronology|url=https://dcuguide.com/w/Jimmy_Olsen_(Silver_Age)_Chronology|access-date=2021-07-04|website=DCU Guide|language=en}}</ref> where a 29th-century descendant of Olsen became [[Superwoman (Kristin Wells)|Superwoman]].

===Post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1987-)===
Following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Jimmy's prior history as a character was erased. Despite recent modernization efforts on Superman and his supporting characters, Jimmy Olsen has not been significantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for ''The Daily Planet'', and is still friends with Superman. His look was made over as he stopped wearing bowties, and started wearing casual clothing (though this trend started in 1970s comics). An interesting alteration to the relationship was that Jimmy designed the signal watch himself, leading to his first meeting with Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller= [[Win Mortimer|Mortimer, Win]]|inker= [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]]; [[Sal Trapani|Trapani, Sal]]|story= Friends in Need|title= World of Metropolis|issue= #4|date= November 1988}}</ref> Superman briefly considered confiscating the watch, but decided to trust Jimmy to use it responsibly.

While Jimmy's transformations no longer occur as regularly as they did in the Silver Age, Jimmy once became a type of "Elastic Lad" on contact with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]; this transformation, however, was extremely painful for Jimmy and has not appeared since.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=83–84}}</ref> He also took the identity of "Turtle Boy" in a series of [[pizza]] [[commercials]], made when he was temporarily laid off from the ''Planet''.

In the 1990s, Jimmy quit the ''Planet'' in a dispute over a story and went to Metropolis broadcaster Galaxy Broadcasting, where he worked as an on-air investigative reporter. This change matured Jimmy somewhat, but he became more ambitious, as well as more brash and arrogant. He still stayed on good terms with both Clark and Lois, to the point where Jimmy was best man at their wedding. This period ended when he believed (wrongly) that he had discovered Superman's [[secret identity]] and said he would announce it live on air. He reconsidered his actions, but lost his job for wasting the timeslot. He was again rehired by the ''Planet''.

Jimmy later came under the angry hand of the [[Alpha Centurion]], an alternate universe dictator with a deep-seated hatred for Superman and eyes for Lois Lane. It was Jimmy who first uncovered his secret plot to control the world's finances through his company Aelius Industries, Inc.

====''Superman: Metropolis''====
Olsen is a central character in the twelve-part miniseries ''Superman: Metropolis'' (beginning June 2003). Written by [[Chuck Austen]] and illustrated by Danijel Zezelj, the series focuses on the futuristic technology unleashed in Metropolis by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] in a previous storyline and how it affects the everyday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Jimmy takes a position as a regular star reporter for ''The Daily Planet'', replacing the recently demoted Clark Kent. This caused a strain at the '' Planet''.

====''Countdown''====

====''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special''====
{{Main|Superman: New Krypton}}
During Superman's fight with [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]], Jimmy witnesses a [[Codename: Assassin|mysterious figure]] hovering over the fight. After some encouraging words from Clark Kent, he decides to take two weeks off to investigate.

He tracks down a figure connected with the past of [[Codename: Assassin|Jonathan Drew]] and is told the story of how Jonathan became Codename: Assassin. His informant is quickly executed by Codename: Assassin who then tries to kill Jimmy. Jimmy is able to avoid being killed and is apparently shielded from Codename: Assassin's telepathy due to his own many physical transformations over the years.

Jimmy goes to [[Project Cadmus]] and speaks to [[Dubbilex]], who tells him the story about the death of the original [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]] at the hands of Codename: Assassin and how cloning is such an imperfect science that the only viable clone alive went into hiding in the desert. Dubbilex then dies from injuries sustained in an earlier conflict with Codename: Assassin. Jimmy heads south to the town of Warpath, AZ, managing to avoid conflict with Codename: Assassin on the way.

Upon arriving in Warpath, Jimmy interviews the sheriff, [[Vigilante (comics)|Greg Saunders]], who evades his questions. Jimmy follows him after dark and sees Saunders working with [[Guardian (DC Comics)|the last Guardian clone]]. He then confronts the clone at his home and the two speak.

With his two weeks up, Jimmy returns to Metropolis horrified from learning that a faction within the U.S. military is actively plotting to kill Superman.

Willing to do anything to uncover the conspiracy behind [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project 7734|Project 7734]], Jimmy uses an anonymous [[online chat|chat]] server and gets in contact with Erik/Amazing Woman from [[Infinity Inc.]], who claims to have informations useful to help Jimmy. Despite being actively pursued by Codename: Assassin, who goes so far to place bugs in his house, Jimmy goes to the appointment, only to find Erik's house burned to the ground.

Jimmy pulls Erik out, who with his dying breath, shifts to his more reliable and powerful Erika form. Erik gives him [[Natasha Irons]]' number. Natasha contacts then Jimmy, telling him about the plans of General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]], his outworldly fortress and his capture, and use of a ''Planet Breaker'' weapon of [[Captain Atom]], now codenamed ''Project Breach'' (due to his similarity to [[Breach (comics)|Tim Zanetti]]'s fate).

Finally ready to uncover the truth, Jimmy is openly confronted by Codename: Assassin, who until that point had merely followed him closely. Jimmy uses his signal watch to call [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]]. Jimmy is shot twice in the chest by Codename: Assassin, and sinks into the ocean.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller= [[Bernard Chang|Chang, Bernard]]|inker= Chang, Bernard|story= The Death of Jimmy Olsen|title= Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special|issue= #2|date= October 2009}}</ref> Despite surviving his assassination attempt, Jimmy decides to fake his death, having his documents planted on a heavily disfigured corpse.

DC Comics has reported in solicits{{when|date=October 2016}} that [[Nick Spencer]] and R.B. Silva will be producing a monthly 10-page backup feature in ''[[Action Comics]]'' chronicling the adventures of Jimmy Olsen in Metropolis.

Beginning with a cover date of September 2019, DC Comics published a 12-part comedic miniseries that restored some elements of the 1954 series to the main DC Comics timeline.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jackson|first=Matthew|date=2020-07-13|title=Exclusive: Matt Fraction and Steve Lieber on finding the 'ending that works' for their Jimmy Olsen comic|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/exclusive-matt-fraction-steve-lieber-jimmy-olsen-finale|access-date=2021-07-04|website=SYFY WIRE|language=en}}</ref> Jimmy was once again shown as Turtle Boy and Elastic Lad, and his antics, glamorous lifestyle as Superman's pal, and strange transformations were depicted as a source of streaming-media ad revenue that was keeping the Daily Planet afloat.  The series explored Jimmy's siblings Janie and Julian, his family's historic relations with the [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] family, a plot involving the attempted murder and faked death of Olsen, and a marriage in Gorilla City that Jimmy subsequently forgot to annul. The series poked fun at DC Comics' own history, including a sequence in which Jimmy angered Batman by suggesting a phone-in campaign to decide [[Jason Todd|whether Robin lived or died]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Comics Book Review: Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen: Who Killed Jimmy Olsen? by Matt Fraction and Steve Lieber.

The series was written by Matt Fraction, drawn by Steve Lieber, colored by Nathan Fairbairn, and lettered by Clayton Cowles.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==

Jimmy possesses a watch which emits a high-pitched signal only Superman can hear. In a 2010 story, he claimed it stopped working some time in the past, never worked particularly well in the first place, and contacted Superman through [[Morse code]] now, anyway, but still wore it for show.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Nick Spencer|Spencer, Nick]]|penciller= [[R.

Mostly during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Jimmy would find himself temporarily transformed, for better or worse, or undergo a disguise for various purposes. The variety of transformations Jimmy received during the Silver Age is often homaged or parodied in later comics and adaptations featuring the character – for instance, in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Jimmy cites three of these transformations as his motivations behind backing Luthor's bill to outlaw metahumans and in ''Countdown'', Jimmy is used as a spirit container for the deceased New Gods, causing him to exhibit strange powers, albeit uncontrollably, with other stories simply making passing references.

===''JLA: The Nail''===
[[Image:Jimmynail.PNG|Jimmy Olsen in ''The Nail''. Art by [[Alan Davis]].|thumb]]
''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] in which a nail punctures a tire on the Kents' car, preventing them from finding the spaceship containing a baby Kal-El; subsequently, Kal-El never becomes Superman. Jimmy Olsen, an aide to Metropolis Mayor [[Lex Luthor]], is revealed to be the primary villain. Having discovered Superman's spaceship and using [[DNA]] samples to create numerous [[Bizarro]] [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]s, Luthor grafts [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] DNA onto subjects who either die instantly or mutate before death, except Olsen. The graft gives Olsen superpowers, but also drives him insane, mentally transforming him into a Kryptonian determined to replace human life with Kryptonian life. Olsen plays up the public's fear of superheroes via propaganda, encouraging the popular view of them as alien invaders rather than the enhanced humans of the Justice Society, hoping to have them imprisoned so he can use their DNA as well in an attempt to create a stable template to create other new Kryptonians.

When his secret identity is revealed, he engages in a fight with the [[Justice League]] that spills into the local countryside. An [[Amish]] farmer attempts to stop Olsen but is blasted by his heat vision—which reveals that the farmer is the (now adult) Kal-El. In this reality, an Amish couple had raised Kal-El as a [[pacifism|pacifist]] encouraged to ignore worldly affairs so that he could walk in righteousness. Olsen asks Kal-El to join him, claiming that they are virtually brothers with the same DNA. When Kal-El refuses, Olsen kills Kal-El's foster parents. During the subsequent battle, Jimmy's body rejects the Kryptonian DNA, causing him to disintegrate. His last words to Kal-El are: "We should have been friends". The Justice League asks Kal-El to join them, recognising that his DNA had just been a contributing factor to a chain of events that had driven Jimmy insane rather than bringing out something that was not there before.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alan Davis|Davis, Alan]]|penciller= Davis, Alan|inker= [[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]]|story= The Nail|title= [[JLA: The Nail]]|issue= #3|date= November 1998}}</ref>

On the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television series (starring [[George Reeves]]), Jimmy Olsen was portrayed by [[Jack Larson]], who appeared as the cub reporter from 1952 to 1958.

Whalin gave a portrayal closer to previous incarnations of the character, playing Jimmy as a lovably naive rookie. When Whalin took over the role, more emphasis was placed on Jimmy's love-life and he would frequently seek out Lois, Clark and Perry's advice on these matters. Whalin's Olsen was described as being a computer whiz and these talents often came in useful to Lois and Clark/Superman, particularly in the episode 'Virtually Destroyed' where Jimmy's computing abilities come in handy as Lois and Superman battle a villain inside of a virtual reality simulator. Jimmy's home life and background is described in some detail throughout the course of the show. Although we never see her, some references are made to Jimmy's mother who is described as being overweight and having allergies. Jimmy's father Jack Olsen is a James Bond-like secret agent for the fictional National Intelligence Agency (N.I.A.) and the episode 'The Dad who Came in from the Cold' is entirely devoted to this character.

====''Smallville''====
<!-- Do not remove the Smallville title as it is used as a redirect link for the Smallville box -->In ''[[Smallville]]'', the [[List of Smallville characters#Jimmy Olsen|series incarnation of Jimmy Olsen]] is first referenced in [[Smallville (Season 2)|season 2]] by [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]]), when she refers to a "cute boy" whose "name is Jimmy", whom she met in Metropolis that made her forget all about Smallville for the summer.  His name is first given in [[Smallville (Season 4)|season 4]] when Chloe confides to [[Lana Lang (Smallville)|Lana Lang]] that he was her "[[first sexual experience (human)|first time]]". In [[Smallville (Season 6)|season 6]]'s premiere "Zod", Jimmy appears in person (portrayed by [[Aaron Ashmore]]) on the staff of the ''Daily Planet'' and prefers to be called "James", and frequently addresses [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] as "CK". As season 6 progresses, Jimmy and Chloe rekindle their old romance again.  At first, Jimmy is jealous of Clark but their relationship becomes friendly after Clark reunites him with Chloe in the season 6 episode "Trespass".

In [[Smallville (Season 7)|season 7]], Jimmy is still at the ''Daily Planet'' working as a budding [[news photographer]], his relationship with Chloe is going through a rough phase due to Chloe's secret new-found ability caused by an amount of [[Kryptonite]] meteor in her bloodstream. They broke up in a very emotional scene in the episode "Cure" since Chloe was unable to share her secret with him.  Meanwhile, [[Kara Zor-El]] ([[Laura Vandervoort]]), daughter of [[Zor-El]] and Clark's cousin, has developed a crush on Jimmy and they become friends. Jimmy is smitten by her and teams up with her in episodes such as "Cure" and "Lara". They are in a relationship briefly, but they break up and Jimmy is shown to be in a relationship again with Chloe in the episode "Sleeper". In the season finale, he [[marriage proposal|propose]]d to her, but she was arrested before she had the time to answer.

In [[Smallville (Season 8)|season 8]]'s premiere "Odyssey", Jimmy is seen waiting for Chloe at the Talon. Chloe arrives and Jimmy tells her that he is taking his proposal back because it might risk what they have between them. But Chloe disagrees and reveals that she does love Jimmy and she will gladly be his wife. She kisses Jimmy passionately afterward. In "Committed", Jimmy admits to Chloe that he lied about his father being a [[Manhattan]] [[Investment banking|investment banker]] — his father is "a part-time [[mechanic]] and full-time [[alcoholic]] in [[Oklahoma City]]", and he has never even met his mother. He apologizes to Chloe for lying, feeling unworthy of her, but she easily forgives him and they kiss. In "Bride", Jimmy marries Chloe in the Kent barn, but the wedding reception is interrupted by [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who nearly kills Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe.  Jimmy's injury is so critical that he must be taken to a hospital in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. In "Turbulence", Jimmy sees Davis Bloome (Doomsday's human form) murder a drunk driver and becomes almost violently obsessed with proving it. Davis convinces Chloe that Jimmy is hallucinating from high doses of [[painkiller]]s, ultimately destroying Chloe and Jimmy's marriage and leaving Jimmy addicted to his pain medication. In season 8's finale "[[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]", Jimmy finally reconciles with Chloe after learning Clark's secret and understanding that Chloe only stayed with Davis to calm the beast within and protect Clark. As Chloe gives Jimmy a passionate kiss, Jimmy is mortally wounded by a jealous Davis, who overhears their conversation and flies into a murderous rage despite being already stripped of the Doomsday persona. Jimmy manages to pushes Davis into a spike and kills him, and reaffirms love to Chloe before succumbing to injury.  At his funeral, his full name is revealed to be '''Henry James Olsen'''. Chloe entrusts his camera to his underage younger brother (portrayed by Ryan Harder). While the younger Olsen's name is not mentioned, the boy is wearing a [[bow tie]],<ref>{{cite episode|title=Doomsday|series=Smallville|credits= Peterson, Brian; Souders, Kelly (writers) and Marshall, James (director)|network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]]|airdate= May 14, 2009|season=8|number=22}}</ref> leading to the possibility that ''this'' is the actual comic book Jimmy Olsen (James Bartholomew Olsen), who will befriend Superman.

In [[Smallville (Season 9)|season 9]] finale, Clark has a premonition about the future in 2013 where [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] calls out to an "Olsen", likely calling the younger brother Olsen.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Salvation|series=Smallville|credits= Septien, Al; Meyer, Turi (writers) and Beeman, Greg (director)|network= The CW|airdate= May 14, 2010|season=9|number=21}}</ref>  In the [[Smallville (season 10)|season 10]] episode "Homecoming", Clark accidentally time-travels to the future in 2017 (thanks to [[Brainiac 5]]) and reads a ''Daily Planet'' article that listed "Jimmy Olsen". In the ending scene of the [[Finale (Smallville)|series finale]] set seven years into the future, the adult version of the younger Olsen (also portrayed by Aaron Ashmore) makes an appearance as a fresh news photographer working with Lois and Clark at the ''Daily Planet'', wearing a [[flat cap]], [[sweater vest]], and [[bow tie]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|credits= Septien, Al; Meyer, Turi; Peterson, Brian; Souders, Kelly (writers); Fair, Kevin G.; Beeman, Greg(directors)|network= The CW|airdate= May 13, 2011|season=10|number=21}}</ref>

The 2008 DVD box set for [[Smallville (season 7)|the seventh season of ''Smallville'']] includes a 22-minute featurette, entitled ''Jimmy on Jimmy'', which is a round-table discussion featuring four of the six surviving actors at the time who had portrayed Jimmy Olsen in live action: [[Jack Larson]] (''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''), [[Marc McClure]] ([[Superman in film|''Superman'' film series]], [[Supergirl (1984 film)|''Supergirl'' film]]), [[Sam Huntington]] (''[[Superman Returns]]''), and [[Aaron Ashmore]] (''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'').

[[Image:Jimmyolsen.gif|thumb|Jimmy Olsen in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
*In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', part of the [[DC Animated Universe]], Jimmy was voiced by [[David Kaufman (actor)|David Kaufman]]. One episode was called "Superman's Pal" as an homage to the classic comic series, and Superman gave Jimmy the signal watch by the end of the episode. Another allusion to the comics made in the show was seen in the second-season episode "Mxyzpixilated", where Mr. Mxyzptlk turns all the employees of the ''Daily Planet'' into animals. Jimmy is turned into a turtle, possibly as a homage.
*Jimmy returns in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. He makes a brief appearance in Superman's nightmare in which Superman (uncontrollably strong) hugs him so hard, killing his friend in "Only a Dream", with David Kaufman reprising the role.

*Jimmy appeared again in several [[cameo appearance]]s in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In the episode "Question Authority", [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] used sleeping gas on him, tied him up, taped his mouth shut, and used the signal watch to attract Superman. In the episode "Chaos at the Earth's Core", several heroes battle a giant turtle that has a thatch of red hair; [[Bruce Timm]] has confirmed this is a reference to Jimmy's [[#Powers, abilities, and equipment|Giant Turtle Boy]] persona "but it was more economical time-wise to have him revert to cute little turtle than naked, confused photographer.".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://jl.toonzone.net/episode53/episode53.htm|title= Chaos at the Earth's Core|date= n.d.|publisher= Toonzone.net|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130603164940/http://jl.toonzone.net/episode53/episode53.htm|archive-date= June 3, 2013|url-status=live|access-date= June 20, 2007}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
* The [[Spin Doctors]] had a minor hit with their song "Jimmy Olsen's Blues" on their 1991 album ''[[Pocket Full of Kryptonite]]'', in which they portrayed Jimmy Olsen as infatuated with [[Lois Lane]] and jealous of Superman, a problem which he hoped to solve with the aforementioned "pocket full of [[Kryptonite]]".<ref>{{cite book|last = Robbins|first = Ira A.|title = The Trouser Press Guide to 90's Rock: The All-New Fifth Edition of the Trouser Press Record Guide|publisher = [[Simon & Schuster|Fireside]]|year = 1997|location = New York City|page = [https://archive.org/details/trouserpressguid00robb_1/page/689 689]|isbn = 978-0684814377|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/trouserpressguid00robb_1}}</ref> In the period after the song became popular, artist [[Jon Bogdanove]], who at the time was the regular penciler on the ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' comic book series, would occasionally depict Jimmy wearing a Spin Doctors [[T-shirt]].
