'''Giganta''' is a fictional character appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media, commonly as a recurring adversary of the superhero [[Wonder Woman]], and an occasional foil of the superhero the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]. She debuted as a brutish strongwoman<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=43}}</ref>  in 1944’s '' [[Wonder Woman (comic book)|Wonder Woman]] '' (volume 1) #9, written by Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]] and illustrated by [[H.G. Peter|Harry G. Peter]], and went on to become one of Wonder Woman’s most recognizable and persistent foes, appearing during every major era of the hero’s comic book adventures, and adapted frequently for television and animation.

The modern incarnation of Giganta possesses the superhuman ability to increase her physical size and mass, effectively transforming into a [[giantess]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Giganta | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 137 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017 }}</ref> This power-set was not a feature of her [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden]] or [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] comic book appearances, but was rather introduced in 1978 as part of the character’s TV adaptation for [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera’s]] popular Saturday morning cartoon series ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends|The Challenge of the Super Friends]]''. The size-changing ability would later be incorporated into the comic book Giganta’s [[Modern Age of Comics|Modern Age]] characterization for her [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] appearances.

Giganta has been adapted into several Wonder Woman-related television and animated film projects. She was played by [[Transgender|trans]] actress [[Aleshia Brevard]] in the 1979 NBC live-action ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' TV specials, in which the character was paired with the Atom (actor Alfie Wise) for a comedic tell-all interview about their supposed "odd couple" romance. Several years prior, actor Mickey Morton donned a gorilla-suit to play a version of the character (called "Gargantua") in a 1976 episode of the ABC TV series ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]''. In animation, Giganta has been played by voice actors [[Kimberly Brooks]], [[Grey DeLisle]], [[Joan Gerber]], [[Jennifer Hale]] and [[Vanessa Marshall]].

==Publication history==
===Creation and Golden Age===
{{main|Golden Age of Comic Books}}
[[File:Giganta_by_Peter.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Giganta in ''[[Wonder Woman (comic book)|Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 1) #28 (1948); art by [[H.G. Peter|Harry G. Peter]].]]
In her first appearance, written by Wonder Woman’s creator William Moulton Marston, Giganta is presented as a preternaturally strong gorilla who, through advanced technology, is mutated into a hulking, red-haired human woman. In an ensuing struggle with Wonder Woman and her allies, Giganta foments a savage revolution, leading a group of prehistoric “cavemen” in an attempt to conquer civilized society. 

Marston was a psychologist who conceived many of Wonder Woman’s early foes as allegories for [[Jungian archetypes|psychological]] and [[Morality|moral]] motifs. His characterization of Giganta blends a common early-20th century misconception about [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin’s]] [[Evolution|Theory of Evolution]] (the fallacy that early human beings descended from modern apes) with another Western commonplace: the [[Colonialism|colonialist]] conflation of pre-civilization with [[Amorality|amorality]]. As such, Giganta’s position as a supposedly primitive human being was understood as granting her both animalistic and potentially malicious characteristics.

After several clashes with Wonder Woman, Giganta became a member of [[Villainy Inc.]], a team of supervillains consisting of several other of Wonder Woman's foes, including the [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Doctor Poison]] and [[Queen Clea]].

=== Silver and Bronze Age ===
{{main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}
{{main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}
[[File:Giganta_by_Andru.jpg|thumb|right|375px| The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Giganta kidnaps [[Steve Trevor ]] in ''[[Wonder Woman (comic book)|Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 1) #163 (1966); art by [[Ross Andru]].]]By the 1960s, Wonder Woman’s comic book adventures had made the leap from the Golden Age world of [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] to the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]]/[[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]] world of [[Earth-One|Earth-1]]. Giganta was reintroduced in a series of stories also featuring another of Wonder Woman’s arch-foes, [[Doctor Psycho]]. In a slight reworking of her Golden Age origin, the now-blonde Silver Age Giganta was still a mutated ape, albeit better at speaking English, and less focused on a caveman revolution than on a resentment of Wonder Woman.

Giganta would return in 1980 as an ally and romantic interest for the [[Flash (DC Comics character)|Flash]] foe [[Gorilla Grodd]], in a plot against Gorilla City. Once again red-haired, the character’s visual design reflected her TV appearances two years earlier on ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends|The Challenge of the Super Friends]]''.[[File:Giganta_by_Fradon.jpg|thumb|left|150px| The [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]] Giganta in ''[[Super Friends|The Super Friends]]'' (vol. 1) #30 (1980); art by [[Ramona Fradon]].]] 

=== Modern Age ===
{{main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}
After DC Comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 (in a publication event known as the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), Wonder Woman, her supporting characters and many of her foes were re-imagined and reintroduced. Though Giganta was initially absent from this revised set of storylines, she eventually returned to the continuity in 1998 in a story by ''Wonder Woman'' writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] as a research scientist named '''Dr. Doris Zuel'''. <ref>''[[Wonder Woman (comic book)|Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2) #136. DC Comics, August 1998.</ref> No longer a gorilla mutated into a human form, this Post-Crisis version of the character was now a human being who transferred her consciousness into the body of a gorilla named Giganta. Through a series of convoluted circumstances prescribed by several writers across several years, Zuel would subsequently transfer her consciousness again, this time into the body of a red-haired [[Metahuman|metahuman]] woman. Now possessing the ability to increase her size and mass, Zuel began using the gorilla’s name “Giganta” as her supervillainous nom de guerre. She embarked on a campaign to bring down Wonder Woman, a project which would lead her to join the modern incarnation of Villainy Inc. 

The characterization of the Post-Crisis Giganta de-emphasized savagery in favor of a more sympathetic interpretation. Storylines in ''[[Atom (Ryan Choi)|The All-New Atom]] '' and ''[[Secret Six]]'' focus with some humor on Zuel’s attempt to juggle a legitimate career in academia with a side-hustle as a villain-for-hire, as well as more seriously on the history of the chronic degenerative illness that led her to seek to transfer her consciousness. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Earth-Two===
[[Image:Giganta-ww28.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Giganta in ''Wonder Woman'' #28.]]
Giganta was introduced as a foe of [[DC Comics]] character [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=119}}</ref> In the story, a scientist named Professor Zool artificially mutates an [[ape]] named Giganta into a malicious red-haired strongwoman. The mutation machine goes haywire and somehow reverts the world to an earlier stage. Giganta joins a primitive tribe to attack Wonder Woman, but is defeated. When the world gets to the [[Golden Age]] of humanity, Giganta causes trouble by encouraging a rebellion, which Wonder Woman stops. When the world returns to normal, Giganta is still in her "strongwoman" form. Giganta is ultimately subdued and captured by Wonder Woman and taken to Themiscyra for rehabilitation.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #9. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta joins a rebellion of prisoners held on the island started by the Saturnian slaver [[Eviless]], thereby becoming a member of the criminal team [[Villainy Inc.]] Eviless steals Wonder Woman's lasso and kidnaps Hippolyta. Giganta joins with the Atlantean [[Queen Clea]] to cause trouble.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #28. DC Comics.</ref>

===Earth-One===
In 1966, Giganta's origin is revamped to include [[Doctor Psycho]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=19369 |title=Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics-The DC Indexes |publisher=Dcindexes.com |access-date=2011-01-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185732/http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=19369 |archive-date=2007-09-27}}</ref> In this story, Doctor Psycho hypnotized a zoo gorilla named Giganta to fall in love with [[Steve Trevor]]. After [[Wonder Woman]] defeats Giganta, Professor Zool appeared asking to have the gorilla turned over to her for experimentation. Taking advantage of this, Doctor Psycho took Giganta out of the zoo and brought her to Professor Zool so that he can use an evolution ray on her. This turned Giganta into a huge blonde woman who still loves Steve Trevor. Wonder Woman defeated Giganta and took her to Paradise Island for rehabilitation.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #163. DC Comics.</ref>

===Doris Zuel===
The contemporary version of the character is the alter-ego of Dr. Doris Zuel,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #127. DC Comics.</ref> who suffers from a fatal blood disease. She captures Wonder Woman and plans to put her "life-essence" into Wonder Woman's body using an experimental machine. Interrupted by [[Wonder Girl]] halfway through the experiment she ends up with her consciousness in a test animal gorilla named Giganta.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Desperate to return her mind to a human body, Zuel the [[gorilla]] abducts a comatose [[circus]] strongwoman named Olga with size-changing abilities<ref name=ww1>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #1. DC Comics.</ref> through unknown means (though Olga was comatose due to a mysterious [[shaman]]) and uses the machine to successfully transfer her mind into that body, keeping the villain name "Giganta".

Following her transformation, Giganta allies herself with [[Queen Clea]] and the modern incarnation of [[Villainy Inc.]] in an attempt to conquer the [[Lost lands|lost world]] of [[Hollow Earth|Skartaris]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #179-183. DC Comics.</ref> Villainy Inc. is defeated by Wonder Woman, but Giganta is subsequently seen as a member of several criminal groups, including the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' TPB. DC Comics.</ref>

As part of the Society, she takes part in the "[[Battle of Metropolis]]", a confrontation with multiple heroes, including [[Elasti-Girl]], the size-changing member of the [[Doom Patrol]]. The Society ultimately loses this battle.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>

When Diana Prince noted that Giganta's intellect reduces as she grows in size,<ref name=ww2>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #2. DC Comics.</ref> compelling the villain to become less rational and more prone to violence, she was corrected by her colleagues in the Department of Metahuman Affairs. They implied that Giganta has overcome that limitation and retains her full intelligence at any size.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) Annual #1. DC Comics.</ref>

[[Image:GigantaNewCostume.jpg|thumb|Giganta in her ''One Year Later'' costume, which she continued to use until the ''New 52''.]]
"[[One Year Later]]," Giganta, along with [[Cheetah (character)|The Cheetah]] and Doctor Psycho, engage in a battle with [[Donna Troy]] (who has assumed the identity of Wonder Woman one year after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''), as part of a search for, as they term it, the "real" Wonder Woman (Diana of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]]).<ref name=ww1 /> The villains continue their quest,<ref name=ww2 /> holding Troy hostage in order to draw Diana out for a rescue attempt and contend with the current [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]], and Diana herself in the guise of government agent Diana Prince. Giganta and her allies also battle [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], with the giantess being felled by the legendary champion.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #3. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta is a teacher at Ryan Choi's Ivy Town University.<ref>''The All New Atom''</ref> Infected and controlled by [[M'Nagalah]], the monstrous ''Cancer god'', she was sent to seduce and capture [[Ryan Choi]], the new Atom, in the process even going so far as to swallow the miniature hero alive (he escapes, and also discovers that she has a tongue piercing<ref>''The All-new Atom'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>). Now free of M'Nagalah's control, a seemingly repentant Dr. Zuel retains her position at Ivy University and has approached Ryan for a second chance, despite the bizarre circumstances of their first meeting.

Before their second date, the Atom is approached by Wonder Woman on behalf of the Department of Metahuman Affairs and asked to wear a wire on his date with Dr. Zuel. After professing her desire to reform, she is informed that Ryan is wearing a wire and tears off the roof of the restaurant to see Wonder Woman and Ryan talking - unaware that Ryan had removed the wire. A fight between Wonder Woman and Giganta ensues. Wonder Woman quickly knocks Giganta out but Ryan intervenes to stop Wonder Woman from beating her further, after admitting she had lost her temper - they realize that Dr. Zuel has disappeared.<ref>''The All-New Atom'' #17. DC Comics.</ref> Whether she heard or saw Ryan's actions to stop her from getting further injuries is yet to be seen.

Giganta is a member of the new [[Injustice League]]<ref>''Justice League Vs Injustice League'' tpb. DC Comics.</ref> and she is one of the villains featured in the [[Salvation Run]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Giganta is also a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], during the [[Final Crisis]] and is shown as a thrall of [[Darkseid]] alongside several other super-powered women. She is now called '''Gigantrix'''.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #3-4. DC Comics.</ref> Over the course of the series she fights as one of the new incarnations of the [[Female Furies]] with [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batwoman]] and [[Catwoman]]. She is possessed by the spirit of the fury [[Stompa]], and only freed when [[Supergirl]] smashes the skull-and-crossbones mask from her face.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta is attacked by Diana while on her way to a date with Ryan Choi,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #36. DC Comics.</ref> implying that their relationship has survived despite earlier difficulties. Mellower than in her appearances in the ''All-New Atom'' series, she seems to accept and respect the shortcomings brought by their different lifestyles, going so far as to help Wonder Woman in a mission, reasoning that, with Ryan being a superhero, they should both be used to putting their heroics in front of their private lives.

Most recently, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] hires her on as one of the new members of Secret Six.<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #21. DC Comics.</ref> The team also includes the shrinking killer, [[Dwarfstar]], who recently hired [[Deathstroke]] and his [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans – Villains for Hire|Titans]] to kill Ryan Choi. Giganta initially seems unaware of this fact, admitting to Dwarfstar that she is dating the Atom (much to Dwarfstar's amusement). Following a disastrous mission to [[Skartaris]], [[Amanda Waller]] reveals the details of Ryan's murder to Giganta. After luring Dwarfstar to her bedroom with the promise of sex, Giganta strips him of his belt (the source of his powers) and beats him into submission. She is last heard covering Dwarfstar's mouth with [[duct tape]] to stifle his screams, telling him that she plans on keeping him alive so that she can prolong his suffering.<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #28. DC Comics.</ref>

In September 2011, DC Comics revised the fictional history of its comic book line under the title "[[The New 52]]". In the revised comic book line, Doris Zuel was bullied as a child due to a rare blood disease. When she got older, Doris tried to cure herself using radiation which resulted in her gaining sizeshifting abilities.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #10. DC Comics.</ref> Giganta appears as a member of the Secret Society during the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline. She assists [[Vandal Savage]] and [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] into tracking [[Pandora (DC Comics)|Pandora]]. When the three villains attack Pandora, Pandora successfully subdues Giganta. Her costume combines elements from her original and ''One Year Later'' costumes.<ref>''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

After her first encounter with Pandora, Giganta returns for revenge following the conclusion of the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline. During their fight, Pandora looks into Giganta's soul, and reveals her origin story. Doris Zuel was a bullied child with a blood disease, but cured herself with a radical procedure that gave her her growth powers. A side-effect of the untested operation was that it reduced her intellect.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Giganta is later recruited by agents of [[S.H.A.D.E.]] to serve as a supernormal asset, fighting vampires and other monsters. She is tempted by the offer of a pardon for her crimes almost as much for the chance to kill things, which she admits to enjoying.<ref>''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #14. DC Comics.</ref>

After the events of "[[DC Rebirth]]," Giganta appeared alongside several other villains as they battled the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 4 #10 (January 2017). DC Comics.</ref>

Later, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor tracked Giganta down to a Los Angeles museum. Giganta had been stealing mystical artifacts for unknown reasons. Wonder Woman managed to defeat the giantess. She was then taken into custody.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 5 #31 (2017). DC Comics.</ref> When Steve Trevor interrogated Giganta in Belle Reve alongside Amanda Waller, he discovered that Giganta had been recruited by Darkseid to steal the artifacts. She told Steve Trevor where to find the remaining artifacts. She stated that she, Steve, and Wonder Woman have had a long history together.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 5 #36 (2018). DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta was then recruited by Amanda Waller into [[Suicide Squad|Task Force XL]] in order to capture the powerful creature known as [[Damage (DC Comics)|Damage]]. During the battle, Giganta revealed that she would love to study Damage's physiology. However, Damage burst through Giganta's hand, leaving her to bandage herself while the rest of the team battled the creature.<ref>''Damage'' (vol. 2) #2 (2018). DC Comics.</ref>

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Giganta is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory. When [[Comedian (comics)|Comedian]] crashes the meeting, Giganta attacks him as the villains start to scatter.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref> Later on, she takes part in the attack led by [[Black Adam]] against the United Nations, where she is beaten back by Wonder Woman.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #10-11 (July–November 2019). DC Comics.</ref> Giganta was with Black Adam's group when the People's Heroes, the Outsiders, and the Doomed tried to get to Superman and gets into an all-out battle with them until it is broken up when [[Doctor Manhattan]] undoes the experiment that erased the [[Justice Society of America]] and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Giganta has the ability to increase her size from 6'6" to several hundred feet. These powers seem to have been given to her magically since the magical power stealing [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] is able to copy her powers.<ref>''Helmet of Fate: Black Alice'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

Though strength and durability are not at superhuman level until she grows, she is still a formidable foe possessing some training in personal combat. As a giant, she is one of the strongest beings in DC; she has overpowered Wonder Woman, Wonder Girl and Power Girl with one hand while not at her maximum height. In fact she is able to crush the bones of all those characters while in her virtually unescapable grip.  When fighting vampires alongside Pandora, she grew to eight feet tall and her strength and endurance were enhanced to the point where a vampire's fangs could not pierce her skin. <ref>''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #14</ref>

Giganta's suit is specialized to grow with her and enhances her invulnerability. Even at normal size, it is bulletproof and resistant to extremes of heat and cold. Unlike Wonder Woman she is not bulletproof at normal size, but unlike her is bulletproof as a giant.

Some versions of Giganta in the stories where she appears are presented as scientists with genius-level intellect. The Post-Crisis version suffered diminished intelligence when she changed size.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #2. DC Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==

===Odyssey===
In the 'Odyssey' storyline that ran through issues 601-614 of ''Wonder Woman'', Giganta was one of many characters re-imagined in the alternate reality created by the goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. She was part of a trio - along with [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall]] and [[Cheetah (comics)#Barbara Ann Minerva|Barbara Minerva]] - of dead Amazons resurrected by the [[Morrigan]] to hunt Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #606. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta possessed no size-altering power, instead relying upon enormous natural strength (enough to shatter a stone statue<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #607. DC Comics.</ref> and throw a [[school bus]]<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #608. DC Comics.</ref>) and a double-headed [[axe]] to fight. She dressed in Amazonian battle-garb decorated with [[leopard]] print, in a callback to her original costume, and stood over six feet tall.

Giganta is eventually won around to Diana's side after being shown the truth of the Morrigan's lies.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #610. DC Comics.</ref> She joins her in attacking their stronghold, killing [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] with her axe even as her flesh is melted from her bones by the goddess' magic.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #611. DC Comics.</ref>

===Justice===
Giganta was featured as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in [[Alex Ross]]' maxi-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]''. Here she is in her traditional costume, though she briefly disguises herself as a nurse and wears hunting gear in her first appearance. She attempts to assassinate the Atom in his office using a sniper rifle, but Palmer is distracted by a phone call and is instead hit in the shoulder. Later in the hospital, Giganta tries to smother the Atom to death with a pillow, though he escapes using his belt and knocks Giganta out a window by getting in her eye. Later, when the Legion toast their apparent victory, she is seen talking with [[Gorilla Grodd]] about his suspicions towards [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s goals. When the Justice League storm the Hall of Doom itself, Giganta fights the League as a whole rather than any particular target. In the end she is defeated by [[Elasti-Girl|Rita Farr]] of the [[Elasti-Girl|Doom Patrol]]. Her origin is more in-line with that of her Golden Age and [[DC animated universe]] counterparts, having originally been a gorilla altered into a human, though she has no known connections with Gorilla Grodd or Gorilla City itself.

===Flashpoint===
In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' universe, two conflicting versions of Giganta existed. In [[Lois Lane]]'s tie-in miniseries, she joined with the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]' [[Female Furies|Furies]], as they had taken over the [[United Kingdom]], and ambushed the resistance.<ref>''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #2 (July 2011). DC Comics.</ref> Here her appearance resembled that of her 'Odyssey' counterpart, and she seemingly possessed no super-powers. She was last seen fighting against [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] on [[London Bridge]], parrying his gunshots with twin swords.<ref>''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>

Conversely, in [[Hal Jordan]]'s miniseries, Giganta appears in her traditional, original costume, and is capable of growing large enough to grasp and crush [[fighter jets]] in her hands. When she is about to kill Hal while he struggles to control his damaged plane, Giganta is shot in the eyes by [[Carol Ferris]], collapsing and playing no further role in the fight.<ref>''Flashpoint: Hal Jordan'' #3 (August 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

===The Legend of Wonder Woman===
Giganta was set to appear in the second volume to ''The Legend of Wonder Woman'', a retelling of Wonder Woman's origins by Renae de Liz and Ray Dillon. However, DC cancelled the project under unknown circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/12/15/dc-comics-cancels-legends-of-wonder-woman-vol-2-half-way-through-being-created/|title=DC Comics Cancels Legend Of Wonder Woman Vol 2, Half Way Through Being Created - Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|date=15 December 2016|website=bleedingcool.com|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> De Liz later posted preliminary artwork featuring Giganta on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=RenaeDeLiz|author=Renae De Liz|number=809602415267901441|date=16 December 2016|title=(Priscilla Rich/Cheetah design not final)}}</ref>

===Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay===
Giganta appears in the digital comic sequel to the animated film ''[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]''.<ref>''Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay'' #4-5. DC Comics.</ref>

===Sensational Wonder Woman===
In the digital-first anthology series ''Sensational Wonder Woman'', Giganta appears in the story "The Queen's Hive", where she, [[Blue Snowman]], [[Doctor Poison]], and [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]] serve as [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]]'s generals.<ref>''Sensational Wonder Woman'' #11-12 (2021). DC Comics.</ref>

===Wonder Woman: Black and Gold===
Giganta appears in the anthology series ''Wonder Woman: Black & Gold''. In the story "Amazing" by Paul Azaceta, Giganta battles Wonder Woman in an unspecified city. Wonder Woman defeats Giganta, rescuing a child from perishing during her apartment building's destruction.<ref>''Wonder Woman: Black and Gold'' #4 (2021). DC Comics.</ref>

After [[Darkseid]] attacks and kills most of the Society, Luthor, Giganta, and the surviving members join forces with the League to foil Darkseid's invasion of Earth before the Leaguers give the villains a "five-minute head start" in return, though Giganta sacrifices a few seconds to give the [[Wally West|Flash]] a kiss before running.
