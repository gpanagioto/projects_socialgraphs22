Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists? Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here. Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house. Would you boys like to meet him? Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero. You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials? You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks. How are they coming?
