'''James''' "'''Jimmy'''" '''Woo''' ('''Woo Yen Jet''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[secret agent]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Woo has since appeared occasionally in a variety of Marvel publications.

The character has made minor appearances in animated media and video games. Additionally, he appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018) and [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' (2021), portrayed by [[Randall Park]].

==Publication history==
Jimmy Woo was the hero of the [[spy fiction|espionage]] series ''[[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]'', named for his [[antagonist]], a "[[yellow peril]]" [[Communist]] [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]].{{clarify|reason="communist mandarin"? Is this a joke?|Obviously we're talking about fiction, but we shouldn't do so matter-of-factly as though such material isn't nonsense.|date=January 2018}} While the short-lived series named after that villain ran only four issues (October 1956 – April 1957), it featured art by Maneely, [[Jack Kirby]], and [[John Severin]].

Kirby took over as writer-artist with issue #2—[[inker|inking]] his own [[penciller|pencil art]] there and in the following issue, representing two of the very rare occasions on which he did so. On the final issue, the inking was done by [[Western fiction|Western]]- and [[war-comics]] veteran Severin. Also, other artists drew the covers: Severin on #2 and #4, [[Bill Everett]] on #3.

Well regarded{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} for its relatively mature storyline with a rare Asian fictional hero for the period and in particular for Maneely's exquisitely atmospheric art,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} the book nevertheless failed to find an audience. Woo and other characters from the series were brought into the Marvel universe a decade later, beginning with the "[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]" story in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #160 (Sept. 1967). Woo joins that espionage agency in ''[[Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (1968 series)|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #2 (July 1968).

Woo went on to be featured in the 1977–1979 Marvel series ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters (comic book)|Godzilla]]'' and the 2006–07 Marvel series ''[[Agents of Atlas]]''. Before the cancellation of the 1990s [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] Marvel imprint [[Razorline]], as produced but unpublished titles of its various series were preparing to blend the Razorline into primary Marvel continuity, Woo as well as [[Nick Fury]] and other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents guest-starred in ''Wraitheart'' #5.<!--sources for previous sentence include:

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:JimmyWoo ST.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jimmy Woo, from ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #166 (March 1968). Art by [[Jim Steranko]] & [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
James Woo is an [[Asian-American]] [[FBI]] agent assigned primarily to investigate and apprehend the [[China|Chinese]]-national mandarin known as the Yellow Claw, a [[Fu Manchu]] [[manqué]] (author [[Sax Rohmer]] had a Fu Manchu novel titled ''[[The Yellow Claw]]''). The Yellow Claw, who attempts world domination, claimed in 2000s comics that his American rubric is a mistransliteration of the Chinese characters for "Golden Claw".<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #4 (Jan. 2007)</ref> Complicating matters, the Claw's grandniece, Suwan, was in love with Woo in the 1950s series.

In [[retcon]] stories, Woo is the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent assigned in 1958 to oversee the 1950s superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], a short-lived predecessor of the later, more established team of that name.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #9 (June 1978)</ref><ref>the 2000s miniseries ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]''.</ref>

As a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Woo went on to join its "[[Godzilla Squad]]" to hunt down the giant monster [[Godzilla, King of the Monsters (comic book)|Godzilla]] (the character from the long-running series of films from the [[Japan]]ese [[movie studio]] [[Toho]]). This unit, led by [[Dum Dum Dugan]], employed such weapons as a [[Mecha|giant robot]] called [[Red Ronin]] (for which Woo was shortlisted as a pilot candidate), and was headquartered in a smaller version of the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], known as the Behemoth.<ref>''Godzilla'' #1–24</ref>

Woo was temporarily replaced by a [[Life Model Decoy]] (a form of [[Android (robot)|artificial human]] utilized by S.H.I.E.L.D.) of the self-aware, renegade "Deltan" class,<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1 (June 1988)</ref> and went through five such bodies before dying with other repentant LMDs.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6 (Nov. 1988)</ref> Woo reemerged from stasis, along with other high-ranking officers that had been taken and replaced.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' vol.2, #44</ref>

In 2006–2007 stories, Woo attempted a secret raid of a group identified as [[Agents of Atlas|The Atlas Foundation]]. Going [[AWOL]] and taking several other willing agents with him, he infiltrated an Atlas Foundation location, resulting in all the recruits being killed. Woo was critically burned and lost higher brain function. The former 1950s Avenger [[Gorilla-Man]], by now also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, gave the organization a classified record of the 1950s team, of which S.H.I.E.L.D. had no prior knowledge. Gorilla-Man rescues Woo with the aid of fellow 1950s teammates [[M-11 (comics)|M-11]] and [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]], who restores Woo to his 1958 self.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #1</ref>

With his teammates he follows the Atlas Foundation around the world, restoring [[Namora]] to life,<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #4</ref> and eventually confronting the Yellow Claw, who reveals that the whole ordeal was only a test. As Woo passed it, the Yellow Claw commits [[suicide]], ending his long life and placing Woo as head of the Atlas Foundation.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #6</ref> Woo later surfaces in New York, where he and [[Spider-Man]] shut down a rebellious cell of the Atlas Foundation.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Later, Woo becomes head of the Pan-Asian School for the Unusually Gifted, a [[Mumbai]], India-based school for Asian teenagers with superhuman abilities. Sanjar Javeed is a teacher there.<ref>''Infinity: The Hunt'' #1</ref>

Woo appears alongside the Asian-American superheroes [[Amadeus Cho|The Hulk (Amadeus Cho)]], [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]], [[Shang-Chi]], and [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] and SHIELD agent Jake Oh, at a charity event attacked by an alien army. Dubbing their group the Protectors, Woo rallies the heroes and bystanders into defeating their captors.<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #13–18</ref> During the [[War of the Realms]], Woo recruits most of the Protectors and several other Asian and Pacific superheroes into the Atlas Foundation as the New Agents of Atlas.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterward, Woo resumes his duties as the head of the Atlas Foundation and installs [[Amadeus Cho|Brawn]] as leader of the New Agents. He also teams with [[Blue Marvel]] and [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] to form a new iteration of the Three Xs.<ref>''Incoming!'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> During [[Atlantis Attacks|an attack by the undersea kingdom Atlantis]] led by [[Namor]] against the portal-city of Pan, Woo introduces the original and new Agents of Atlas to each other.<ref>''Atlantis Attacks'' #1.  Marvel Comics</ref>

==Reception==
Jeff Yang, curator of the "Marvels & Monsters: Unmasking Asian Images in U.S. Comics, 1942–1986" exhibit at the [[Japanese American National Museum]], called Jimmy Woo a "positive exception" to the "largely negative" depiction of Asians and Asian-Americans in comics at time when "the view of Asians was shaped by racist, xenophobic wartime propaganda."<ref>{{cite web |last=Wada |first=Karen |date=2013-12-08 |title=‘Marvels & Monsters’ exhibit explores comics’ portrayal of Asians |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/comics/marvels-monsters-exhibit-explores-comics-portrayal-of-asians/ |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2013-12-09}}</ref>
