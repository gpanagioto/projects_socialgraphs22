Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals... ...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team. But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week! And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade! Let's hear it for these brave souls! What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!  Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere. And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison.  Nurse Gollum!! Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China. Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum ''not'' feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats! As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation. Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows! And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum! Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--
