Welcome back to the South Park Gun Show. We've had over 2000 gorgeous guns come through this arena today. It's been whittled down to seven, the winners from each group. David, take us down theh line.  An absolutely gorgeous gun, David. And there's the Mayor with her delightful Rhodesian ridgeback shotgun-rifle mix. And there it is, just a beautiful gun in motion. Everybody loves it.  And it looks like the gun show is under attack, David.
