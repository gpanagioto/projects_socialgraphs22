And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game.  Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants.  Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal! Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win! Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing.  Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County.  And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie. His shot is blocked! What a great save!  And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players. It's a tie game here in Colorado as we get set to start the final period. Your attention, please: for this third and final period, the Detroit Red Wings will be playing... the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
