==Fictional character biography==
'''Blockbuster''' is a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a team of superhuman assassins brought together by the mutant thief [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] when he was in the employ of the enigmatic [[Mister Sinister]]. On Sinister's orders, the Marauders [[Mutant Massacre|massacre]] the underground community of mutants known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. In the course of the massacre, the Marauders, including Blockbuster, clash with various superhuman champions, including the mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Vol 1 #210 (October 1986)</ref>

The Norse god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], summoned to the Morlock tunnels by his ally, the frog Puddleglup, happens upon Blockbuster following his torture of the mutant [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]]. After a brief battle, in which Blockbuster is able to break Thor's left  arm, Thor kills Blockbuster to avenge the innocent Morlocks he has slain. Thor then burns his remains, along with the other slaughtered Morlocks.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' Vol 1 #374 (December 1986)</ref>

Sinister uses his technology to clone the Marauders. Blockbuster and other previously-slain Marauders return during the demonic invasion of Manhattan referred to as the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]].  Blockbuster is among the Marauders set by Sinister to defend his orphanage/laboratory headquarters.  Blockbuster is slain by the mutant [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], who had, along with most of the X-Men, been tainted by the demonic invasion, becoming more bestial and aggressive.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #243 (April 1989)</ref>

Though the X-Men discovered and deactivated many of Sinister's Clone Vaults after the events of the crossover saga [[X-Cutioner's Song]], Blockbuster returned with the other original Marauders, when they attacked the X-Mansion.<ref>''X-Men'' #200</ref>

===Messiah Complex and Death===
Blockbuster's body is seen later being "eaten" by [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]] after he and the rest of the Marauders arrive at an Alaskan town. The Marauder's goal had been to find a mutant baby, a current rarity; they had also encountered the Purifiers, another group searching for the child.<ref>''X-Men: Messiah Complex'' Vol 1 #1 (December 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Michael Baer has an immense physical size, which grants him tremendous strength, stamina, and resistance to injury. He is shown to be powerful enough withstanding direct blows from Thor, at least for a while. Then, the first Blockbuster was eventually killed by him. His [[Cloning|clones]] shared the same powers as him, but further augmented by [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 #240 (January 1989)</ref>
