We find the defendant, Jerome "Chef" McElroy... guilty as charged. 
What are you doing here, little boy? Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others? Chicken wings! Quick! Everybody help the children!  Come on! Let's get you back to civilization! Your little friend helped me out. We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard. You mean, you don't mind? Thatâ€™s swell! 
Hey! Hey, what's goin' on here?! Why aren't you people workin'?! Protesters? Who? All right, all right! What do you PC babies want?  Aw, come on PC Babies! Why does that matter?!  God damnit, not everyone cares about race-relation programs! Come on, PC Babies! We got a job to do!
