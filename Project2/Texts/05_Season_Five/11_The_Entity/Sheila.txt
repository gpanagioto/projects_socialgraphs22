That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us. He's your age and about your height. Oh, there he is.  How was your flight?  You remember Uncle Gerry.  And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle. Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle.   Here we go, Kyle Two.  Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you? Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?  Yes, Kyle Two? He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already. He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin. Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school. I'm sure your friends will love him. Kyle Two, he's your responsibility. I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk. Kyle Two, where is Kyle? Where on earth could he be?   What? Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.  Kyle, what happened to you?? Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright? Oh, it's been days! Where can he be? I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.  You're back! Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
