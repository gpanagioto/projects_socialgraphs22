A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that. I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo. Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting. Aha.  Wow, filet mignon' and lobster! Yeah. Can we go now, please? Finally, we get to go skiing! Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us ''will'' come in handy. Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody. How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo! Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back! My God, can you believe those people?! The police work for time-share, too?
