 Oh. Hello there, children. Uh, how's it goin'?  Pretty cool, ain't it? Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle.  Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be watching this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure. Why can't this guy control his temper? Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool features, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here-  Let's see. Menu?  Aw, dammit! I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," ''then'' "function."  No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?  Yes I read the instruction manual! So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," '''then''' "enter."}}
