Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong. There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town! Goddammit! Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body? Uhhhh... oh. Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect? Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys? Haw, camel poo. Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it! Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed. I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people. How about fishing without a license? Whataya call this then? If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you...  by gunshot to the head. That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget. ''For''-get. Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalape√±o poppers. What's that? I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot? Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie! Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established. Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet. All right, all right! I can't read! There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! I need to go poopies. Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it? Ahhh... O... O-- Ahhh... O...  Did you kids actually learn how to read this way? Haa haa. Ha ha ha. I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, ''Go, Dog. Go!''. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.  Hooray! <poem><i>Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...</i></poem>  Oooh, pretty good. Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chicken''lover''. Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken? Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's. I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report. Oh boy, I'm in big trouble. I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos. Hey, that's right. You ''can'' help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis. You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. Sure, nightsticks for everybody! You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case. Now, what did that clue say again? To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare! We need a copy of ''Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft'' right away! Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word?  Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--" That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately! Oh, weak, dude! We're too late! Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.   "Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame! Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo. It is, too! "Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--" "Pet--" Wait a minute.  Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off! Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. Oh, no! Shhh! Keep your eyes peeled. Grab him! I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon! Oh. Caught you red-handed! By reading ''Teetle the Timid Taxidermist''. Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?" No, no, that's ''not'' how you uphold the law!  Thank you, everybody. Thank you.  What? Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  reading totally sucks ass! Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: ''Atlas Shrugged'', by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!  Thanks, boys.
