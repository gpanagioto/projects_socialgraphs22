I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled. Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before  It's like Obama all over again. Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright? Luckyyy...
