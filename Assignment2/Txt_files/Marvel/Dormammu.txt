The character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (Nov. 1964), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=115}}</ref>

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Dormammu has appeared in six decades of Marvel publications, featuring prominently in the [[Doctor Strange]] titles and limited series as the [[archenemy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/dormammu/in-comics|title = Dormammu in Comics Powers, Enemies, History &#124; Marvel}}</ref> of the [[mysticism|mystic]] hero.

==Publication history==
=== Origin ===
Dormammu first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126–127 (Nov.–Dec. 1964),<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=108–109}}</ref> but had been mentioned previously in dialog, along with his realm the "Dark Dimension".

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] said:

{{blockquote|text=To Lee and Steve Ditko, the Lord of the Realm of Darkness and the associated invocations were just another piece of business, another way of adding depth to the {{sic|?|otherwordly}} nature of Strange's adventures. However, the readers were intrigued. They wanted to know more. "It seems there was something about that nutty name, Dormammu, that was keeping Doc's devoted disciples awake at nights trying to figure out who Dormammu was," Lee explained. "I knew I was in big trouble. I had made up the name—now I had to dream up a character to go with the name. But who? How?

Ditko visualized the answer. "He gave the demoniac DD...a visage totally different from any villain I had ever seen in comics before," proclaimed Lee.<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>}}

After being established as the ruler of an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimension]] (later described as the god-tyrant of its denizens),<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 3 #14 (2005). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Dormammu became a perennial foe of Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, who until this time had dealt almost exclusively with off-beat "one-off" mystical threats in ''Strange Tales'' #110–125 (July 1963–Oct. 1964).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=103}}</ref> Strange's first encounter with Dormammu in the "Dark Dimension" also introduced [[Clea]], eventually revealed to be the niece of the villain (like Clea's name, this was not initially revealed in ''Strange Tales'' #126; Nov. 1964), and the monstrous and imprisoned [[Mindless Ones]].

The character's major appearances include starring in an epic fifteen issue storyline in ''Strange Tales'' #131–146 (April 1965–July 1966); the discovery that Dormammu has a sister, [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], and both are in fact mystical beings called ''Faltine'' in ''Strange Tales'' #150 (Nov. 1966); teaming with fellow villain [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] to instigate the "Avengers-Defenders War" in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #115–118 (Sept.–Dec. 1973) and ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #8–11 (Sept.–Dec. 1973); ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' Annual #9 (1981); ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #1–2 (Nov. 1988 & Jan. 1989) and the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of the Bones'' #1–4 (Feb.–May 1999) and ''[[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]]'' #1–3 (Sept.–Nov. 2000).

After a major appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #498–500 (Oct.–Dec. 2003), Dormammu became the patron of small-time villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #46 (Dec. 2008).

== Fictional character biography ==

=== 1960s ===
Dormammu is first mentioned by [[Karl Amadeus Mordo]], senior apprentice of the appointed "Sorcerer Supreme" the "[[Ancient One]]", who, in the entity's service, attempts to slowly weaken the sorcerer, but is stopped when his fellow pupil [[Stephen Strange]] alerts his master to the betrayal.<ref>{{Cite comic

The character later appears in person when sending a messenger to boast his renewed intentions of conquering his universe before his aging adversary. In response, Doctor Strange travels to Dormammu's "[[Features of the Marvel Universe|Dark Dimension]]" as the Ancient One does not consider himself powerful enough to defeat Dormammu, and manages to overcome all supernatural servitors sent against him. Dormammu engages Strange in mystic combat and shows himself to be far more powerful, but, when drawing upon the realm's energies, inadvertently weakens the barrier containing the horde of [[Mindless Ones]]. Since they threatened Dormammu's subjects, Strange helped his enemy to re-seal the juggernauts by letting power from his amulet flow into Dormammu. Indebted to Strange for his help, Dormammu ends the fight, and in return Strange demands a binding vow to never enter the "Earth realm" again and to not harm Clea. Dormammu complies, but gains a burning hatred against Strange for the humiliation.<ref>{{Cite comic

Dormammu uses a loophole to his oath by granting Mordo vast power, whereupon the sorcerer leads his minions on a lengthy hunt for Strange, and abduct the Ancient One as a bargaining chip. Dormammu's niece, [[Clea]], assists Strange by weakening the barrier of the Mindless Ones, forcing her uncle to focus elsewhere. Dormammu learns of her betrayal, brings all three Earth sorcerers to a neutral realm, to let her see his disciple destroy Strange, and summons fellow "Lords of the Netherworlds" to watch the spectacle. When Strange begins to get an advantage against Mordo, Dormammu decides to face the sorcerer in a contest of pure hand-to-hand-combat. The physically stronger entity eventually falls to his foe's greater familiarity with [[martial arts]]. To Dormammu's humiliation, before the gathered Lords, Strange forces him to vow not to menace the Earth even by proxy. The villain strikes a parting blow by banishing Clea, and inciting another lord to attack Strange.<ref name="Martial arts fight">{{Cite comic

Dormammu captures Clea, and overpowers and imprisons Strange. The sorcerer manipulates Umar into freeing him, and then surprises Dormammu by pushing him through a portal to the Earth. This makes the entity wither from the curse cast by his own power, when vowing to never enter the Earth realm, and he departs to his own plane.<ref>{{Cite comic

The Eye is reassembled, and allows Dormammu to merge his own universe with all the planets of the "regular" Marvel Universe without breaking his vow. Dormammu imprisons the traitorous Loki and effortlessly overwhelms all of his other opponents, leaving only the [[Scarlet Witch]]. When Loki escapes and distracts Dormammu, the Scarlet Witch casts a hex on the Eye that causes it to absorb Dormammu, and costs Loki his sanity.<ref name="Avengers/Defenders War">"Avengers/Defenders War" from:

Summoning extraterrestrial sorcerers as his lieutenants, Dormammu vows to "burn" and replace the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] as the greatest power in the Earth's universe, but is distracted and tricked by Clea and Strange (his consciousness occupying a [[rat]]), while their ally [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] exorcises Dormammu's presence.<ref name="Celestials">{{Cite comic

===1990s===
The character reconstitutes again, regains control of the Dark Dimension from Clea by subverting her will, and summons her parents, Umar and Orini, from exile. Umar and Baron Mordo join forces with Clea and Doctor Strange. The enraged Dormammu threatens to completely destroy the "Dark Dimension" in retaliation, but Umar convinces him to accept a compromise as the ruler of a sub-realm, whereas his sister takes over rulership from Clea, with Mordo as her consort. Clea agrees to abdicate rather than see all of her people killed, but promises to return if Umar becomes a tyrant again. Dormammu finds that he has been tricked into becoming the ruler of the realm of the Mindless Ones.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer= Roy Thomas; [[Dann Thomas]]| penciller= [[Jackson Guice]] | inker= [[Tony Dezuniga]]; [[Mark McKenna (comics)|Mark McKenna]]| story= The Dark Wars | title= Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme | volume= 1 | issue= 21–24| date= October–December 1990| publisher= Marvel Comics}}</ref>

This frees Dormammu to reclaim his realm. He absorbs Umar and Mordo into himself, becoming more powerful than ever before, and he disintegrates the assembled entities.

Strange, at the time weakened without support from the "Principalities", confronts Dormammu with his allies Clea, the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Hulk]], and [[Ghost Rider]], but they are unable to cause any injury to the villain. Strange journeys into the core of Dormammu's essence and uses the [[Eye of Agamotto]] to strip away his self-delusion, and make him acknowledge that his thirst for chaos, power, and conquest are unworthy of a being of his stature. Dormammu is momentarily shaken, and appears to be defeated, but this is only a mirage. The villain gloats that he has not shown "one tenth" of his true power against the heroes, but that he now realizes that rulership of "one puny" universe is beneath his notice, as he now has far greater and "more interesting" ambitions, and contemptuously dismisses the "insignificant mortals".<ref name="SecretDefenders">{{Cite comic| writer= [[Len Kamanski]] <!-- | artist= Geof Isherwood --> | story= The Heart of Darkness | title= Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme | volume=  | issue= #48–50 | date= Dec. 1992–Feb. 1993 | publisher= Marvel Comics | page= | panel= }}</ref>

The character observes the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]—adventurers from the [[31st century]] of [[Earth-691]]—travel to the mainstream era of [[Earth-616]]. Dormammu follows them back to their [[dimension]], merges with his counterpart in this timeline, doubling his power, and attacks their headquarters, demanding the presence of the Doctor Strange of their time. Strange, now called the Ancient One, arrives with his disciple, the alien [[Krugarr]], and battles Dormammu, assisted by the Guardians, the "Galactic Guardians", and the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. Dormammu kills the elderly Strange, and almost overwhelms his other foes, but is defeated when Krugarr summons the spirit of Strange, and they channel the combined power of everyone in the assembly to banish Dormammu to his home dimension.<ref name="GotG">{{Cite comic | writer= [[Michael Gallagher (writer)|Michael Gallagher]]<!-- | penciller= [[Kevin West]] | inker= [[Steve Montano]] --> | story= | title= Guardians of the Galaxy | volume=  | issue= #34–36 | date= March–May 1993 | publisher= Marvel Comics | page= | panel= }}</ref>

Dormammu returns, now in a symbiotic link with Umar. Together they petition the "''Pan-dimensional Oversight Council''" (counting Strange and [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] among its members) to perform a [[preemptive strike]] against Earth's superhumans, as "potential [[weapons of mass destruction]]", and when the petition fails, Dormammu eats most of the present council-members, whereas Umar reduces the rest to "screaming blobs of mindless jelly". The siblings then attack and overcome the entity Eternity, and use the acquired power to remake all universes in their hellish image. The pair are opposed by a reuniting of some of the original Defenders (Strange, the Hulk, and [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner), with Dormammu retreating when Umar steals his power.<ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen">{{Cite comic

==Character==
Dormammu has been described as "something worse than a demon".<ref name="Hood"/> It is unknown exactly how ancient he is, as he inhabits a wholly alien realm, separate from the rest of the [[Marvel Universe]], that defies the laws of physics as understood on Earth. He is known to have already existed at the creation of the current demonic netherworlds;<ref name="hellcat"/> to have clashed with Agamotto hundreds of millions of years ago; to have served as the primary enemy of the Vishanti ever since; and to have been considered an extreme threat by the mages of "[[Kull of Atlantis|pre-cataclysm]]" [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]].<ref name="Marvel Zombies"/>

Dormammu is presented as the most powerful and malevolent of "the Faltine",<ref name="SecretDefenders"/> a higher-dimensional mystical energy beings. Not native to the "Dark Dimension", Dormammu and "his" sibling Umar were exiled for slaying their progenitor "Sinifer" and for their morbid/unclean obsession with physical matter. They journeyed to the Dark Dimension in search of experience, and assumed corporeal forms.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #22 (Oct. 1990)</ref> Dormammu merged with the local "Flames of Regency" to further enhance his power, and returned to an energy state, whereas Umar had grown accustomed to physical pleasure. After imprisoning the horde of marauding virtually unstoppable [[Mindless Ones]], Dormammu enslaved the entire realm and demanded worship as its sole deity. He continued to gradually merge other mystical universes to his own, while spreading his worship to any sorcerers throughout the multiverse who invoked his powers.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 2 #72</ref>

The character is sometimes shown as incredibly patient, with certain plots to achieve his goals spanning billions of years,<ref name="hellcat"/> whereas others are planned far more recently or even improvised through opportunity.<ref name="SecretDefenders"/> Although extremely intelligent, with tremendous knowledge of the mystic arts, he is overwhelmingly arrogant, generally does not adapt well to sudden confusion and unexpected developments,<ref name="GotG"/> and has a tendency to gloat over technically outmatched foes rather than swiftly finish them off.<ref name="Martial arts fight"/><ref name="Avengers/Defenders War"/><ref name="SecretDefenders"/><ref name="DoctorVoodoo">''Doctor Voodoo: Avenger of the Supernatural'' #1 (2010)</ref> What makes Dormammu different from other prominent Marvel supervillains is that he has been shown as fully capable of personally defeating cosmic entities, even without external power sources and outside of the "Dark Dimension".<ref name="GotG"/><ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/>

Originally genderless siblings, Dormammu and his sister Umar have an unpredictable love-hate relationship. Sometimes loyal and collaborative, other times they gladly betray each other or take the other's power for themselves.<ref name="SecretDefenders"/><ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/> Umar has an occasional tendency to sarcastically puncture her brother's obsessive histrionics with more pragmatic sadistic hedonism.<ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/>

Writer [[Keith Giffen]] has described them as "Donnie and Marie from hell. The brother-sister sibling rivalry relationship blown up to nightmarish, universe-shattering proportions." Nevertheless, Dormammu is "completely inhuman",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=37585 |title=Giffen & Dematteis Talk Defenders And A Little Bit Of Everything |publisher=Google.se |access-date=2011-02-12 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> the kind of character that "commits mass murder... on a whim".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=34406 |title=Defending Drax With Keith Giffen |publisher=Google.se |access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref>
