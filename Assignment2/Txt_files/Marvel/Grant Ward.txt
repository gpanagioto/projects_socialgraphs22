'''Grant Douglas Ward''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that originated in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] before appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], first appeared in the [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' in September 2013 through to the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth season]] in April 2017, and was continually portrayed by [[Brett Dalton]].

==Fictional character biography==
Grant Douglas Ward, the son of politicians, was abused by his parents and older brother Christian growing up. After escaping from military school, stealing a car, and attempting to kill Christian by burning their house down, Grant meets [[John Garrett (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|John Garrett]], a [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] double agent within [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who visits him in juvenile hall. Garrett tells Grant that his parents are pressing charges and Christian is petitioning the court to have him tried as an adult. Garrett trains Grant to be a skilled agent.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Ragtag |episode-link=Ragtag (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) |series=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |series-link=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=May 6, 2014 |season=1 |number=21}}</ref> Later being assigned to [[Phil Coulson]]'s team,<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Pilot |episode-link=Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) |series=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |series-link=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=September 24, 2013 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref> Grant is outed as Hydra when that organization is revealed to the world.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Nothing Personal |episode-link=Nothing Personal (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) |series=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |series-link=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=April 29, 2014 |season=1 |number=20}}</ref> After the death of Garrett, Grant becomes a prisoner of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Beginning of the End |episode-link=Beginning of the End (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) |series=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |series-link=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=May 13, 2014 |season=1 |number=22}}</ref>

Joining forces with one of Hydra's previous leaders, [[Gideon Malick]], Ward travels through a portal to an alien planet in search of the ancient Inhuman [[Hive (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Hive]], but is killed there by Coulson.

== Characterization ==
{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=I think what I was given was just a huge opportunity to play somebody who is more complex, more interesting, more dangerous, scarier in a way that Ward wasn’t. I get to play two different characters in a way.|source=—Dalton on being informed of his character's double agent status.<ref name="DaltonReveal" />}}
Dalton has described Ward as he first appeared in the series as "a guy who is very trustworthy and rolled up his sleeves and did all the heavy lifting and didn’t really question authority. You know, a by-the-book risk assessor". Although it was eventually revealed that Ward was a Hydra imposter, Dalton noted that that doesn't necessarily mean the relationships the character built with his S.H.I.E.L.D. team weren't genuine, since going undercover meant letting his guard down to make the other characters trust him, opening himself up to those relationships despite his ulterior motives.<ref name="DaltonReveal" />

Following the death of Garrett, the question was asked, "Who is [Grant Ward] without someone telling him what to do?" Dalton answered that "he can follow commands really well. He can do and make tough choices and he can sometimes do unpleasant things in the name of something that he feels he believes in. But...I don’t think that Ward knows the answer to that question himself." Dalton called the character a 'wildcard', since he was loyal to Garrett as a father figure rather than Hydra, "and he was more about his teammates rather than the team",<ref name="DaltonRebuilding" /> later elaborating that "It’s not quite good guy, it’s not quite bad guy. It’s not trying to get in with S.H.I.E.L.D. again, it’s not trying to get in with Hydra. He’s really on his own path. He’s living by his code at this particular point in life."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=October 29, 2014 |title='Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' star Brett Dalton: Can Ward ever be trusted? |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/10/29/agents-shield-brett-dalton-ward-escape-spoilers/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101134905/http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/10/29/agents-shield-brett-dalton-ward-escape-spoilers/ |archive-date=November 1, 2014 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Explaining Ward's relationship with Palamas, Dalton stated <blockquote>When they first started this relationship, I thought they’re two people who have experienced something similar by following orders and then finding themselves not knowing who they are when someone’s not telling them what to do....But it really [has] developed into something that’s much more complicated than that. There’s a teacher-student relationship there as well as what seems like a genuinely romantic relationship. You see us really lovey-dovey in the cockpit and it’s making everybody around us sick. In some ways, we have the most healthy relationship out of all of the other dynamics on the show, which is saying something because Ward is not a lovey-dovey kind of guy. That’s interesting that he’s now in probably the most stable relationship there is.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=April 29, 2015 |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Why didn't Ward pull the trigger? |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/28/agents-shield-why-didnt-ward-pull-trigger |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528033757/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/28/agents-shield-why-didnt-ward-pull-trigger |archive-date=May 28, 2015 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref></blockquote> When Ward accidentally kills Palamas in the season two finale, Dalton said that "This affects him in a way that is deep and lasting. There was a shred of humanity in there, and always the possibility and the thought that he could be redeemed...After Kara’s death—that is actually at my hands—after all the time and effort and energy that’s been invested in this relationship, it turns him. You see it in his eyes....This whole thing of closure keeps coming up over and over again. There is so much closure out there in the world that needs to be achieved.

Speaking about the monolog Ward gives in "[[Maveth]]", Dalton noted that some viewers thought Ward sounded like "a born-again, devout, off-my-rocker person at that point", but Dalton felt that it was "a real moment for Ward where he actually gets a sense of there's something greater than revenge and all of these smaller emotions; there's actually something that's bigger out there that he's a part of."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Terri |date=December 12, 2015 |title=Agents of SHIELD: Brett Dalton Teases Ward 2.0'S Bigger Purpose |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2015/12/12/agents-of-shield-brett-dalton-teases-ward-20s-bigger-purpose |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212203554/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/12/agents-of-shield-brett-dalton-teases-ward-20s-bigger-purpose |archive-date=December 12, 2015 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[IGN]]}}</ref> Following Ward's death later in the episode, Bell discussed whether the writers ever considered redeeming the character, saying, "No character is too high to fall or too low to be redeemed, theoretically....but for someone to be redeemed, they need to ask forgiveness, or want to be redeemed....[Ward] never felt like he needed to apologize for what he did."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bucksbaum |first=Sydney |date=December 8, 2015 |title='Agents of SHIELD' EP Explains What's Next After That Shocking Midseason Finale Death |url=http://edit.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/agents-shield-midseason-finale-death-846860 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6dhUjMD4x?url=http://edit.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/agents-shield-midseason-finale-death-846860 |archive-date=December 11, 2015 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> Dalton returned to the series in the fourth season to portray Ward in the Framework.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=February 21, 2017 |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. welcomes back original cast member |url=https://ew.com/tv/2017/02/21/agents-shield-brett-dalton-ward-return/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222224858/http://ew.com/tv/2017/02/21/agents-shield-brett-dalton-ward-return/ |archive-date=February 22, 2017 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Dalton felt returning to the character in this capacity allowed him to "finally get to have the hero arc that he believed Grant Ward deserves."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=April 1, 2017 |title=WonderCon: Agents of SHIELD Panel |url=http://www.cbr.com/agents-of-shield-panel-wondercon-2017/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402170602/http://www.cbr.com/agents-of-shield-panel-wondercon-2017/ |archive-date=April 2, 2017 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref>

Dalton was surprised that people "seem to be standing with Ward no matter what he does....there are people out there who just seem to be following this character wherever he goes. I think that’s brilliant....There isn’t any character like him on the show, and I would say even within the Marvel canon." As a "shoutout" to these fans, Palamas says, "I will always stand with Ward" in the second-season finale, which Dalton called "a testament to the fans, this incredibly loyal fanbase that has now influenced the script of our show."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Terri |date=May 13, 2015 |title='Agents of SHIELD' Season 3: Brett Dalton is excited Ward is 'officially' the Big Bad |url=http://zap2it.com/blog-post/agents-of-shield-season-3-brett-dalton-excited-ward-officially-big-bad/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503191058/http://zap2it.com/blog-post/agents-of-shield-season-3-brett-dalton-excited-ward-officially-big-bad/ |archive-date=May 3, 2016 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Zap2it]]}}</ref>
