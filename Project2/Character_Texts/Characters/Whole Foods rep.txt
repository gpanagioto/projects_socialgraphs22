 Everyone, please go about your business! I need to see this town in its normal goings on, to see if it is indeed a Whole Foods town. P.C. Principal. I like that. So you've just recently moved here? And do you believe this town is deserving of a Whole Foods? Mmmmm-hm.  Show me a classroom please. Please continue as if I am not here.  Mmmmm-hm. Hmmm, I enjoy how you've retained the lower-income housing with the updated and quaint urban developments. Hmmm. I have seen enough for today. I am weary. Where shall I sleep? So these are the cattle that the local shops and restaurants are supplied with. And where does the butchery take place? And are the bullets made from reclaimed metals?
