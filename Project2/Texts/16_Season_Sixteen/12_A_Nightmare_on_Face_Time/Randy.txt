 It's finally happened, Sharon!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.  And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now. I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video!  Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it? You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition. Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan? Well? There she is.  Shelly come on! Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Well, what do you think? Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it. You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS. How many uh, how many copies of ''Meet The Fockers'' do we have in stock, Shelly? Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly. Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?  People just don't know we're open yet!  Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something? Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong! Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place! I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone! Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!  Hey, whoa, what are you doing? Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night! Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here! . This is the night we turn it all around. Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be ''swamped'' with people trying to rent DVDs! Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!   Sooner or later! They'll have to come!  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie! I'll take a DVD of ''Robocop 2'' and the director's cut of ''Blade Runner''. No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak. He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother. No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!   Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little ''talk'', Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  What are you doing, Shelly? Okay.  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'! Who are you people?! You aren't real! Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  Run! You'd better run! Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr! Haarrrr!  Raaaawr!  Streaming ''Halloween 4''! Hahaha! AAAAA!  Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?! Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!   No... Yeah... Okay... Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange.
