It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile. Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, "Where is Captain Hindsight?" With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now? Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident.  The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement: Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign.
