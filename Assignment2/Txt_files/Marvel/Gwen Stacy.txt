'''Gwendolyne Maxine Stacy''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as a [[supporting character]] in those featuring [[Spider-Man]]. A college student and the daughter of [[George Stacy]] and [[Helen Stacy]], she was the first romantic interest for [[Peter Parker]] following his high school graduation before she was murdered by the [[Green Goblin]] ([[Norman Osborn]]). Her death has haunted Peter ever since, and stories  published long afterwards indicate she still holds a special place in his heart.

The character was portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007) and by [[Emma Stone]] in [[The Amazing Spider-Man (film series)|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' film series]] (2012–2014). A [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] is voiced by [[Hailee Steinfeld]] in the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''. She will reprise the role in ''[[Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse]]'' (2023).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early history===
In her initial appearances, Peter Parker met Gwen while both were studying as undergraduates at Empire State University,<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Sanderson |title=The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York City |year=2007 |pages=30–33 |isbn=978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> but with [[Aunt May]] in the hospital, Peter was troubled and ignored her advances. She dated both [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Harry Osborn]] to make Peter jealous. Gradually, however, a romance developed; Gwen, a science major, appreciated Peter's intellect. Their relationship began almost immediately after Peter stopped going out with [[Mary Jane Watson]], whom he began to see as shallow and self-absorbed.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Later issues introduced Gwen's father, NYPD Captain [[George Stacy]], as well as her mother [[Helen Stacy]] and her uncle Arthur Stacy. Though her father was both fond of Peter and supportive of his alter-ego Spider-Man, his death strained Peter's relationship with Gwen after he was killed by falling debris during a battle involving Spider-Man and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #90. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 55: "Captain George Stacy had always believed in Spider-Man and had given him the benefit of the doubt whenever possible. So in Spider-Man's world, there was a good chance that he would be destined to die."</ref> Gwen blamed Spider-Man for his death, and left for Europe to cope with her loss. She wanted Peter to ask her to marry him and convince her to stay, but his guilt stopped him from proposing.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #93. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gwen's feelings for Peter eventually prompted her to return to New York, and their relationship was rekindled.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #98. Marvel Comics.</ref>

According to Lee, who scripted all of the stories featuring Gwen Stacy up to this point, the original intent was for Gwen Stacy to be Spider-Man's central love interest. However, [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s unexpected popularity with readers after her debut changed the course of the plan as fans liked Mary Jane more and demanded for her to be Peter Parker's main love interest instead, and that "no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter collaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!"<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisch|first=Sholly|title=The Wedding of the Year|work=[[Marvel Age]]|issue=54|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1987|pages=12–15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 30|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

===Death===
{{Main|The Night Gwen Stacy Died}}
[[Gerry Conway]] and [[Roy Thomas]] succeeded Stan Lee as writer and editor, respectively, of ''The Amazing Spider-Man''. Together with inker [[John Romita, Sr.]], they came to the decision to have Gwen Stacy killed off.<ref name="LeeAmazing32">{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 32|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> It was Romita who first suggested the idea, during a plotting session with Conway when Romita was still penciller on ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.<ref name="CloneGen">{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Gerry|title=Spider-Man: Clone Genesis|date=June 1995|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|isbn=0-7851-0158-6|pages=4–5|chapter=Foreword}}</ref> Conway later said his contribution to the decision was motivated by a desire to bring Mary Jane Watson to the forefront,<ref name="CloneGen"/><ref name="clone69">{{cite journal|last= Veronese|first= Keith|date= October 2010|title= Spider-Man: The Beginnings of the Clone Saga|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 69|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> as he shared Lee's feeling that she was a more interesting character than Gwen Stacy: "[Mary Jane] hadn't lost the edge that made her an interesting character.

In [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121]] (June 1973), the [[Green Goblin]] kidnaps Gwen Stacy and throws her off a bridge (depicted as the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] but described in the text as the [[George Washington Bridge]]).<ref name=saffel65>Saffel, Steve.

In Superior Spider-Man #3, Peter briefly reunites with Gwen and her father in the afterlife, along with all his other lost loved ones, while in Doctor Octopus's failing body. Peter apologizes to them both for failing them but neither hold Peter accountable with Gwen even saying that “it worked out” because they were “together” and kissed him on the cheek.

Both the decision to kill Gwen and the method in which Marvel implemented it remain controversial among fans because some believe that Peter himself was the one who caused her death. The death became a pivotal point in both Spider-Man's history and in [[American comic book]]s in general. Many point to Gwen's death as the end of the [[Silver Age of Comics]].<ref name="Blumberg">{{cite journal| last = Blumberg| first = Arnold T.| date = Fall 2003| title = 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died:' The End of Innocence and the Birth of the Bronze Age| journal = Reconstruction| volume = 3| issue = 4| url = http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm| access-date = 2008-11-14| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100116034408/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm| archive-date = 2010-01-16}}</ref> Before her death, except possibly as part of an origin story, superheroes did not fail so catastrophically, nor did the hero's loved ones die so suddenly and without warning.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Sanderson|first1 = Peter|author-link = Peter Sanderson|editor-last = Gilbert|editor-first = Laura|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 159|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In June [1973], Marvel embarked on a story that would have far-reaching effects.

A note on the letters page of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #125 states: "It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her".<ref name="saffel65"/> The comic book ''Civil War: Casualties of War: Captain America/Iron Man'' (2007) concurred that the proximate<!--word is correct; NOT "approximate"--> cause of death was the sudden stop during a high-speed fall. An issue of ''Peter Parker/Spider-Man'' revisits the issue, and further confirms Gwen died of a broken neck due to the use of the webbing.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> On the other hand, in the 1987 edition of the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', Gwen's death is attributed to the fall, not to Spider-Man's webbing, though the listed cause of death is still technically true - if she hadn't fallen from the bridge, the event that caused her death couldn't have happened. In his book ''[[The Physics of Superheroes]]'', physicist [[James Kakalios]] confirms that, consistent with [[Newton's laws of motion]], the sudden stop would have killed Gwen Stacy.<ref>[http://www.it.umn.edu/news/inventing/2002_Spring/superhero.html ''Inventing Tomorrow'' (University of Minnesota Institute of Technology magazine), Spring 2002: "Jim Kakalios enlists the aid of costumed crimefighters to teach critical thinking in an imaginative freshman seminar" by Paul Sorenson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615181025/http://it.umn.edu/news/inventing/2002_Spring/superhero.html |date=2006-06-15}}</ref>

Within the [[Marvel Comics]], Gwen Stacy's death has enormous repercussions. [[Mary Jane Watson]] feels the loss of Gwen deeply and becomes a more mature, compassionate person. Gwen's death also draws Peter and Mary Jane into a closer friendship, and eventually to romance.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Miles Warren, one of Gwen's professors, was secretly in love with her. Following her death, Warren goes insane and adopts the persona of the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Jackal]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the fourth and final issue of the miniseries ''[[Marvels]]'' (April 1994), photographer Phil Sheldon befriends Gwen Stacy, who has absolved Spider-Man of any blame for her father's death. Gwen's simple faith in heroes convinces Sheldon of the purpose of the "Marvels" (i.e., superheroes)—to protect innocents such as Gwen. He resolves to write a book to praise the heroes and what they should mean to humanity. When the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage to bait Spider-Man, Sheldon frantically follows the resulting chase in a taxi and witnesses her death. While it is reported that she died from the shock of the fall, Sheldon thinks it looks like something else. Sheldon's faith in the Marvels is shattered.<ref>''Marvels'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Clones===
Following the publication of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121, Stan Lee (who had since become Marvel's publisher) was frequently criticized by fans during his public appearances for killing off Gwen Stacy.<ref name="clone69"/> Lee, who had also found the character's death objectionable,<ref name="LeeAmazing32"/> insisted that Conway write a story bringing her back.<ref name="clone69"/> Conway strongly objected since he felt any sort of resurrection would break the plausibility of the stories, but ultimately gave in under the condition that after reviving Gwen, he could write her out of the book as soon as he wanted.<ref name="Walker 21"/> He decided that cloning would be the best means to bring the character back.

In the resulting story, written approximately two years after the story of Gwen Stacy's death,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_giant_size/005.html|title=SpiderFan.org - Comics : Giant-Size Spider-Man #5|website=www.spiderfan.org}}</ref> "Gwen" reappears, perfectly healthy but with no memory of the time since her death. This story, published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 (May 1975), initiated the [[Clone Saga#The original Clone Saga|original Clone Saga]]. At the end of that story, Gwen's clone, a creation of Spider-Man villain the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], leaves to find a new life for herself, coming to accept that she is not really the same person who had a relationship with Peter Parker.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 1988 crossover "[[The Evolutionary War]]", the [[High Evolutionary]], who had once been Miles Warren's teacher, captures Gwen's clone. He determines that Warren had actually not perfected the process, and instead injected a young woman with a genetic virus carrying Gwen's DNA, turning her into a copy of Gwen. After a subsequent altercation of Spider-Man and the Young Gods against the High Evolutionary's Purifiers, this woman is purged of the virus by the Young Goddess Daydreamer.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #8 (November 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> This is later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]], with the High Evolutionary stating that Warren had in fact succeeded in perfecting his own cloning technique, and Daydreamer had accidentally given the Gwen clone a false new life under the name of Joyce Delaney.<ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' #1 (November 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the second "[[Clone Saga]]", Joyce, now married to a clone of Professor Warren named Warren Miles, sees a copy of Peter Parker's book of Spider-Man photos, ''Webs'', and remembers (to an extent) her real history. She returns to New York City, but after helping Spider-Man and [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] fight the Jackal, she again disappears from Spider-Man's life.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #61: "Heading Toward Omega" (August 1995) and ''Spider-Man: Maximum Clonage Omega'' (August 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> She makes herself a new life in London, but before she is murdered by the Gwen Stacy clone known as Abby-L shows signs of clone degeneration.<ref>''Spider-Island Deadly Foes'' #1 (October 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another Gwen clone appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (March 1995). This clone believes she is the real Gwen. She dies from clone degeneration in ''Spider-Man'' #56 (March 1995), the next issue of the story arc.

A further Gwen clone appears in the "Sibling Rivalry" crossover storyline between ''[[Superior Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Spider]]''. She joins the Jackal (alongside [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] and a regular Miles Warren clone) in capturing [[Superior Spider-Man]] and [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]].<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is sympathetic towards "Peter" and Kaine, but at the same time utterly loyal to the Jackal. When the Spiders break free, Superior Spider-Man disarms and attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Kaine. When the Jackal's lab is engulfed in flames, Kaine offers to save her, but she refuses, and is seemingly consumed by the fire.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Stacy Twins": Sarah and Gabriel===
The story arc "Sins Past"<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' 509-514 (August 2004-January 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] reveals that Gwen Stacy had an affair with [[Norman Osborn]] and fell pregnant with twins, a girl and a boy, to whom she gave birth while in France, and named [[Sarah and Gabriel Stacy]], respectively. Gwen vowed to raise the twins with [[Peter Parker]] and refused to allow Norman access—an event which precipitated Norman's decision to kill her. By the time that Peter and his (then-considered-to-be) wife, [[Mary Jane Watson]]-Parker, discovered the twins' existence, they were grown to adult proportions, despite the relatively "short" time since Gwen's death, due to the genetic effects of their father's "goblin formula".

Sarah and Gabriel revealed their existence to Peter, with threats and as masked figures, after their father was publicly exposed as the [[Green Goblin]]—sending to Peter a page of an unsent letter from Gwen "from a time when she traveled to Europe between college semesters"—which revealed her pregnancy; an analysis of the letter by police detective Lamont revealed handwriting impressions of a second page—saying that she had given birth,<ref name="OHMV">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'', "Stacy Twins" (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> with the twins born fully developed after only seven month's gestation. When Peter as [[Spider-Man]] went a genetics lab, where he would prove Gwen's maternity of the twins, Sarah confronted him, and Spider-Man unmasked Sarah<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #511 (October 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>—finding her to be "a dead ringer for Gwen".<ref name="OHMV" /> Gwen Stacy herself, however, only appears in this story arc in flashback, as Mary Jane explained to Peter that she knew about Gwen's illegitimate offspring and Norman's paternity thereof because she overheard Gwen and Norman arguing over custody of the children<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #512 (November 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>—a secret of Gwen's that Mary Jane had "promised to keep all these years".<ref name="OHMV" /> Sarah later signed up with [[Interpol]], while Gabriel later become the Gray Goblin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #514 (January 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Marvel would later walk back on this revelation in the pages of [[Nick Spencer]]'s run on ''Amazing Spider-Man'' during the [[Sinister War]] event. Norman Osborn arrives at the safe house of Gabriel and Sarah in Paris, where an [[Artificial Intelligence]] back-up copy of his son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] reveals to Norman that he never truly fathered the twins, and that he never had a sexual encounter with Gwen Stacy. The whole plan was to convince him he had the heirs he always wanted, so AI Harry hypnotized Norman and [[Mary Jane Watson]] with the help of [[Mysterio]] and the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]], while [[Mendel Stromm]] created the mutated twins in a lab (this explains their rapid aging, as it's not truly related to Osborn's Goblin serum). Thus, this is all an elaborate scheme of Harry's to torment both his father and Peter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #74. Marvel Comics</ref>

(See article ''[[Sarah and Gabriel Stacy]]'' for more information.)

===''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy''===
In the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline,<ref>''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy'' #1-5 (December 2016-April 2017) and contempraneous ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' tie-ins. Marvel Comics.</ref> a flashback revealed that Gwen Stacy was conscious during Spider-Man and Green Goblin's battle on the bridge, and as she was falling to her death. She overheard their conversation and discovered Peter is Spider-Man in the process. She was angry at Peter for keeping this secret and for his involvement in her father's death. This flashback confirms the [[Green Goblin]]'s real motivations for the murder: he clearly states that Gwen "is just a pawn", contradicting the whole core of ''Sins Past'' in which Osborn wanted to kill her to keep the twins with him and silence her forever. The whole "Stacy-Osborn" affair was retconned during the ''[[Sinister War]]'' event, 17 years later.<ref name="clone conspiracy 1">''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy'' #1 (December 2016). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the present, Gwen is supposedly revived by the Jackal—who here would later be revealed to be a re-animated [[Ben Reilly]] (Spider-Man's main clone)—with his clones. The Jackal tells her she is ''not'' a clone but the real Gwen, who was harvested and reanimated from her remains and still has all her memories, including those of her death. The Jackal offers Gwen the opportunity to be his business partner as he tries to change the world with his new technology. Gwen is hesitant about this new life at first but accepts it when the Jackal shows that he has reanimated the clone of her father, who is in much better health than he was before he died.<ref name="clone conspiracy 1"/> When Spider-Man arrives at the incorporation and discovers the Jackal's experiments, he is surprised by Gwen's presence and notes that unlike the other people the Jackal revived, who were all clones, Gwen does not trigger his spider sense, making him wonder if she was the real one. He is attacked by the "reborn" [[Doctor Octopus]] before he can question the issue further.<ref name="clone conspiracy 1"/>

After the Jackal breaks up the fight and shows Spider-Man around the New U, the George Stacy clone recognizes something off about Gwen's face and points his gun at her. It is revealed that the Gwen clone was actually her Earth-65 counterpart [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]] who assists Spider-Man in escaping. The real Gwen is kidnapped by [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and taken to [[Parker Industries]] to be studied. Kaine reveals that he and Spider-Woman came to this Earth to assist Spider-Man because they saw that Spider-Man agreeing with the Jackal's offer on other worlds always results in a global disaster.<ref>''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy'' #2 (January 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref> Rhino and (a version of) Electro are sent to retrieve Gwen after attacking the staff, but Gwen tells them to take Kaine with him too because his condition could help with Jackal's experiments. [[Anna Maria Marconi]] also volunteers to come with because she has studied both Kaine and the drug.<ref>''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy'' #3 (February 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Spider-Man is taken to Haven, he catches up with Gwen in the household in the facility, where she tries to convince him to support New U Technologies. Peter still has a hard time believing she is the real Gwen given his other experiences with clones. Gwen tries justifying her existence by telling Peter her memories, including how she overheard the Green Goblin talking to Spider-Man before her death. Peter thinks she died hating him, but Gwen said that she did not hate him, but rather died feeling betrayed. Peter again still has doubts towards Gwen not being a clone. She tries kissing him, to no avail which only pushes him to put the mask back on. Gwen witnesses Jackal order the cloned villains to kill Spider-Man and decides to help Peter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #23 (March 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus pulls a switch that activates the Carrion Virus in all of the revived, including Gwen and George, and causes them to start rapidly decaying.<ref>''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy'' #4 (March 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref> After Gwen's father deteriorates in her arms, she assists Spider-Man by helping him get to the lab. When the cloned villains get to the lab doors, Gwen locks Spider-Man inside the lab and sacrifices herself to give him more time. Following the Carrion Virus being thwarted, Spider-Man and Anna check the building and see that Gwen has been reduced to dust.<ref>''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy'' #5 (April 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Last Remains]]" storyline, [[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|Kindred]] later visited the cemetery where Gwen Stacy and George Stacy were buried. He exhumed their bodies and placed them around the table at his hideout while awaiting for Spider-Man to find him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Spider-Man finally confronts Kindred, Gwen and George's corpses were sat around a dinner table alongside the exhumed bodies of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], [[Flash Thompson]], J. Jonah Jameson Sr., [[Jean DeWolff]], and Marla Jameson.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #51. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==

==="Age of Apocalypse"===
In the two-issue mini-series ''X-Universe'', which details what happened to the rest of the Marvel Universe during the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, the Green Goblin never killed Gwen Stacy. Instead she became the bodyguard of Donald Blake, who, in this reality, had never become [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|the Mighty Thor]]. Sometime later in the mainstream universe in X-Man #37, the Age of Apocalypse version of Gwen is pulled from her reality to the mainstream Earth's George Washington Bridge, much to Spider-Man's shock.

==="Heroes Reborn"===
In the ''[[Heroes Reborn (2021 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]'' event, a change in the timeline results in a continuity in which the Squadron Supreme are Earth's mightiest heroes while the Avengers never came to be. In this reality, Gwen was inspired by her mother to become a psychiatrist at Ravencroft Asylum. After the death of [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]] (which mirrors how Gwen died in the main continuity), she was trained by [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and became the vigilante known as '''Nightbird'''. She briefly dated Flash Thompson for a time, but her refusal to be with him drove him to be insane and become the second Jackal. She also appears to have a close relationship with [[Misty Knight]].<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Night-Gwen'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="House of M"===
In the reality seen in the "[[House of M]]" storyline, in which the [[Scarlet Witch]] alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans, Gwen was never killed. Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She had become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist – and had a decidedly hostile relationship with chemical weapon developer [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Mary Jane Watson, a popular actress in this reality, played Gwen Stacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man's life story. Gwen and her father read textual accounts of their deaths in the main universe, though they believe this simply to be the morbid imaginings of Peter Parker, who is suffering from mental health issues.<ref>''Spider-Man: House of M'' #1-3 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Adventures''===
Gwen Stacy first appeared in ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'' #53 as a new student of Midtown High. She had transferred from her previous school after the Torino Gang, a powerful New York mob, began harassing her in an attempt to keep her father, police captain George Stacy, from arresting members of their gang. However, the Torinos continued to harass Gwen at Midtown, prompting Spider-Man to help the police take down the gang.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #55. Marvel Comics.</ref> Like her father, Gwen believes Spider-Man is a hero. She subsequently began participating in a "Spider-Man Appreciation Society" designed to foster better public opinion of Spider-Man.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gwen is also attracted to Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker; although she openly flirted with him, Peter began dating a different girl, [[Sophia "Chat" Sanduval]], which made Gwen very unhappy.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #54.

At a gig of theirs, an assassin is sent after Gwen's father, who is in the audience. Gwen defeats the assassin, the audience and band clearing out during the battle. While they are alone, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen taking off her mask to reveal who she is.

MJ, attempting to fix this, breaks up with Peter and reunites with Harry,<ref>''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'' #9.

===''Spider-Man: Life Story''===
''Spider-Man: Life Story'' features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Gwen discovers that Peter is Spider-Man when she sees his costume underneath Peter's shirt at the train station shortly after Flash was deployed to Vietnam. She eventually marries Peter and becomes Chief Biologist for Miles Warren's bio-engineering company. In 1977, Harry Osborn's attack on Warren's company as the Black Goblin revealed that Miles created clones of Norman Osborn, Peter, and Gwen. Harry blows up the containment tubes containing the clones which kills all of them except for Peter's clone. However, Miles reveals that the "Gwen" Peter was with was actually her clone; he abducted the real Gwen with the intention of attempting to win her over later, with the result that the real Gwen died in the explosion. A year later, Peter and Gwen's clones rename themselves as Ben and Helen Parker and move out of New York for a second chance at life, the clone's relationship with the original Peter apparently not surviving the revelation of her clone status.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #1-2</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
Gwen Stacy first appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #14 (December 2001) as a teenage girl at Peter's high school. In this continuity, Gwen, whose rendition by artist [[Mark Bagley]] was inspired by an early-career [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]],<ref>Brucie, Dylan (March 2007). "Ultimate Spider-Man". ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Xtra!]]''. p. 110.</ref> has amber eyes, wears punk-style clothing, and harbors a rebellious personality.<ref name="bagley-eyes">In an interview in [[Wizard Magazine]] #180 (2006), [[Mark Bagley]] remarked there were some "coloring issues" in Gwen's first appearances. He did not intend her eyes to be yellow.</ref> In her first appearance, she gives a rousing speech on 'super powers' and later pulls a knife on [[Kenny McFarlane|Kong]], one of [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter]]'s bullies, and is suspended from school temporarily. Gwen becomes friends with Peter, which leads Mary Jane Watson to believe she is vying for his affections.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gwen is later taken in by [[Ultimate Aunt May|Aunt May]] after her father, police captain John Stacy, is killed by a burglar wearing a Spider-Man costume and her estranged mother does not want to take her in. Her living in the Parker house creates more tension between Peter and Mary Jane, and leads to their temporary break-up. Peter's relationship with Gwen is further complicated by her hatred of Spider-Man, whom she blames for her father's death. When Peter finds his friend [[Eddie Brock]], Gwen confides in him about her feelings of isolation. Eddie then tries to kiss her and Gwen is shocked.{{issue|date=July 2013}} When she eventually learns Peter is Spider-Man, the angry Gwen pulls her father's gun on him. He manages to convince her he is not to blame for her father's death. Gwen runs off but returns, explaining she is just really mad at everything at the moment. She wouldn't have really shot him, a fact Peter already knew because his spider sense didn't go off despite Gwen's wrath. Gwen then agrees to keep his secret.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gwen Stacy dies in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #62. Before her death, she made peace with Mary Jane and assured her she never had romantic feelings for Peter. She considered him just as a friend. She is killed by [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]], a symbiotic which is the offspring of the Venom symbiote. Although Peter is not in the area when she dies, he still feels some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation. His guilt makes him decide to retire as Spider-Man for a while. Eventually, he takes up his hero identity when his responsibility for the innocent becomes too great to overlook.{{issue|date=July 2013}} At the end of the arc, there was an issue that dealt with Gwen's death. [[Flash Thompson#Ultimate Marvel|Flash Thompson]] makes an off-color remark about Gwen's passing. It infuriates MJ to the point where she physically attacks Flash. It is revealed Flash had a crush on Gwen all along.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

A girl seeming to be Gwen Stacy appears in ''Ultimate Spider-Man #98''. According to [[Mark Bagley]], "Gwen’s return is integral to the Clone storyline and is basically a way to rock Peter's world...again".{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001060044.cfm "Wizard Universe"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122065848/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001060044.cfm |date=January 22, 2008}}</ref> In this issue "Gwen" appears to have no memory of her "death" and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue #100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages "Gwen". She transforms into what appears to be Carnage before leaping out the window.{{issue|date=July 2013}} In the next issue, "[[Dr. Richard Parker|Richard Parker]]" claims "Gwen" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in [[stem cell research]]. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury, and the Spider-Slayer drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue #113, Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin causes a massive prison break from the Triskelion. An inmate appearing to be 'Gwen' walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It has been revealed the creature posing as Gwen Stacy is still the original Ultimate Carnage Spider-Man faced earlier in its run. After "devouring" Gwen, this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her "essence" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy.{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[http://www.ign.com/comics/ultimate-spider-man "Ultimate Spider-Man Pictures Full Size"]. [[IGN]].</ref>

During the "War of the Symbiotes" storyline, Gwen/Carnage's back story in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with Tony Stark. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker's house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage's face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Venom on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie but Eddie reabsorbs his symbiote along with the Carnage symbiote rendering Gwen Stacy an average girl. After a series of tests, it is concluded that this Gwen is not a clone but consciously and genetically is the original now reborn (though Gwen's original body died, the Carnage symbiote absorbed her being and they had bonded since her death). After S.H.I.E.L.D. intervenes, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Danvers states Gwen will remain in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Peter and May argue for her to come back to live with them, with Tony Stark supporting the Parkers. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #129, the Parkers are now helping to rebuild Gwen's life. Her ghastly experience with the Carnage symbiote also causes her to develop a death anxiety she gradually controls. Six months after the "Ultimatum" storyline, in ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' #1, Gwen is living with the Parkers again and is dating Peter after MJ broke up with him. However, circumstances involving the Chameleon made Gwen realize that Peter and MJ are still in love, and believes that they shouldn't be together, even if she wants to be with him. She breaks up with him, but vows to be his loyal friend. She also continues to live with the Parkers due to Gwen and Aunt May having become close in a surrogate mother-daughter fashion.

After Peter's death, Gwen and May re-locate to France but return to New York after hearing about the re-emergence of a [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|new Spider-Man]], Miles Morales.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Men]]" storyline, Gwen and Aunt May meet the Peter Parker of the [[Earth-616]] continuity after he is accidentally and briefly sent to the Ultimate universe. They even attack him, as they believe he is trying to imposter their Peter.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is only through his mannerisms similar to Peter and his choice of words that they believe that he is not an imposter. Gwen, being intrigued to learn about her counterpart (although she is not informed that her other self dead), talks with him. Later, she also tries to tell Mary Jane about the other Peter's arrival in their world, as the two have formed a friendship.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Green Goblin escapes custody after S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down, he arrives at the front yard of Aunt May's house and confronts Miles.<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gwen and Aunt May are inside watching the television where the battle of Miles and Green Goblin was being broadcast. Soon, Peter emerges to aid Miles in the fight, to the surprise of Gwen and Aunt May. Green Goblin flees at his arrival and the two Spider-Men depart. Gwen is unsure of the identity of the original Spider-Man, but Aunt May assures her that his motives show that it is him.<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Gwen and Aunt May walk over to Mary Jane's house and overhear Peter's explanation of his unknown resurrection. Gwen sprints over and joyfully reunites with him.<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the two Spider-Men defeat Green Goblin, Peter tells Gwen that he intends to go on a quest to find out the truth of his mystery resurrection and leaves her and Aunt May once more, promising to return.<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Ultimate Universe is destroyed in the ''Secret Wars'' event, but the world is restored later on. In it, Peter returns to the role of Spider-Man and Gwen is possibly still living with Aunt May.

Early in the series, ''Ultimate Spider-Man #25'' (October 2002) paid homage to Gwen Stacy's death in the [[Earth-616]] continuity, although Gwen herself was not involved. The Green Goblin tossed Mary Jane off the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. Spider-Man caught her leg with his webbing, just as with Gwen. The issue ended with a cliffhanger: when Spider-Man pulled Mary Jane up, she appeared to be either unconscious or dead. The cliffhanger was resolved in the next issue when Mary Jane awoke in #26, uninjured.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

After explaining himself to her, Peter proposes to Gwen, and she accepts. Meanwhile, the Green Goblin mails to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] proof of Spider-Man's real identity. On the day of Peter's wedding to Gwen, Jonah has published the expose and uses it to acquire a warrant for Peter's arrest. Peter escapes from the police moments after his wedding to Gwen, but the issue ends with Peter on the run from the law and pondering his uncertain future.

[[Mysterio]] poses as [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to take hostages on the same bridge where Stacy died and uses a holographic projection of her death to put Spider-Man at a psychological disadvantage. After Spider-Man drives Mysterio away, he takes a moment beside the hologram projector to mourn Stacy's death.
*Gwen Stacy is reinterpreted as "Paige Embry" in ''[[The Refrigerator Monologues]]''. She is the unofficial leader of the Hell Hath Club, a group of women in the afterlife trying to cope with the brutal termination of their plot lines, and provides connecting narration for each of their stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/guide-comic-book-wives-girlfriends-inspired-refrigerator-monologues/|title = A Guide to the Comic Book Wives and Girlfriends Who Inspired the Refrigerator Monologues|date = 7 June 2017}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Due to the popularity of [[Spider-Gwen]], in June 2015 Marvel published variant covers for 20 of their current series, which saw Gwen Stacy re-imagined as other Marvel characters, such as [[Doctor Strange]], [[Groot]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/24438/gwen_takes_over|title=GWEN TAKES OVER|publisher=Marvel|date=14 April 2015|access-date=5 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827021439/http://marvel.com/news/comics/24438/gwen_takes_over|archive-date=27 August 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> One of those variants, for "Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars #2", featured an amalgam of the design of Gwen Stacy and [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]] dubbed "[[Gwenpool]]", which turned out to be especially popular with the fans.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rich |last= Johnston |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/08/21/and-finally-has-marvel-noticed-that-gwenpool-is-a-thing-now/|title=And Finally… Has Marvel Noticed That Gwenpool Is A Thing Now?R|publisher=Bleeding Cool |date= August 21, 2015}}</ref> As the result, Marvel produced two stories featuring Gwenpool as a character, a backup story in the series "[[Howard the Duck]]", and a one-shot "Gwenpool Holiday Special #1",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-announces-gwenpool-one-shot-howard-the-duck-back-up-stories|title=MARVEL ANNOUNCES "GWENPOOL HOLIDAY SPECIAL", "HOWARD THE DUCK" BACKUP STORIES|publisher=Comicbookresources |date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> with ''Howard the Duck'' #1 establishing that her name is actually "[[Gwen Poole]]", not Gwen Stacy, or even an alternate version of either Gwen Stacy or Wade Wilson. Following the publication of the one-shot, an ongoing series titled ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' by the same creative team was announced, starting in April 2016.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/21/marvel-announces-gwenpool|title=Marvel announces new Gwenpool series|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>
