Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing. You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off. Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you. Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing.  Keep your guard up, Tweek!  All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here.  Punch him in the balls, Tweek!!  Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down!  Good! Now ''kick'' his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood. Now THAT'S BOXING!
