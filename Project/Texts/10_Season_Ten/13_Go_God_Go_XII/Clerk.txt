Welcome to Zeebod's Toys Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?  This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive. Oh, all right, then I ''have'' to have 6000 credits.   Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present. Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
