 Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division!  You're out.  Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs. I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough! Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game!  Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball! Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming. Keep running, kid!
