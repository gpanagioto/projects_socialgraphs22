Wooo!  You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im! Hey... That's that other "ni**er" guy. That's the guy from ''Seinfeld'', used the N-word a whole ''bunch'' o' times. Mark Fuhrman? He done said the N-word in the O.J. case. 
 Hey that guy's jackin' it! 
Ahh,  Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please? Agh! 
Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy? You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'? Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman? Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon? Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey? You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent. I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.  Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it. 
Go, go, go!
