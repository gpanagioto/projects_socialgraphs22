 Dude, what the hell was that?  ...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk. You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.  He's fakin'! Now, that's a get-well card!  Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle? Go on, Butters! Butters, go on! Dude, you really are sick, huh? Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like? Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin? What? Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago. Don't be a smartass? Hi, doctor.  Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick. But I don't think it's working.  Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world. ...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care. Who?  Oh, shit. Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question. Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life. What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney. His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but it's obviously not working. Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle? But you only need one, fat boy! Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?! Oh my God! Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die! What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?! Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here.  You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities? Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't. Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about? And that has something to do with their medicines because...? Nobody wants to listen, Kenny. I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again. I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.   This is it?? This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??  Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me! We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney.   Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy. Sshhh! If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright? Alright Butters, let's go.  Oh, no! Oh, phew. Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here... ...vein right, well-  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?! You suck, Cartman! God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!  There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!  Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again!  So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital? That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan. Dude, please. Kyle needs it. Alright, alright, here.  You look a lot better. Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do. Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you! It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney. Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been? Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches.
