Oh no, you're not doing this again. Stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch. Yeah, and you guys get wasted. Did you hear anything about what happened last night? Your buddy, Chip Duncan?  Apparently, he flew around on a broom, blew things up, and kidnapped some children? You heard nothing about this?! He flew away vowing we'd all be dead by Halloween! Randy, what did you guys do at that party? People were hurt!  Where do you think you're going?  You can't possibly be considering doing this again! Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don't think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!
