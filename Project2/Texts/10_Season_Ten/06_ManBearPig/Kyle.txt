Dick Cheney?  Just play the game, fatass! Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late! We know.  Okay, Mr. Marsh.  He's half man and half bearpig. That doesn't make any sense. Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction. Yeah, we've got school anyway. What do ManBearPig droppings look like? What? What are you doing?!  Hello? We're trapped in here! Hello, help! Forget it! They can't hear us! A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here. You see anything, Kenny?? Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything?? Cartman, you okay??  You need help?? It looks like we're completely sealed in. Maybe we should go for it. Why? No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon. Aw, dude!  They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman? Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes! C-Cartman? Dude, what are you doing? Dude, get away from me! Stan! Stan, wake up! No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him.   We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die. Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him. Come on come on! Pull! What the hell is that?? What the hell is that?  Ruuun!  Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs! Yes you can! I need your help! We need to get our friend to a hospital right away! Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure? You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
