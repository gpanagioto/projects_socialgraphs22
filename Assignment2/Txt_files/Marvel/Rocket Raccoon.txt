==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Rocket raccoon 01.jpg|right|thumb|''Rocket Raccoon'' #1 (May 1985). Cover art by [[Mike Mignola]] and [[Al Gordon]].]]
Rocket Raccoon acts as the "Guardian of the Keystone Quadrant", an area of outer space sealed off from the rest of the cosmos by the so-called Galacian Wall. Rocket is captain of the starship ''Rack 'n' Ruin'', and he and his first mate [[Wal Rus]] (a talking [[walrus]]) come from the planet Halfworld in the Keystone Quadrant, an abandoned colony for the [[mental disorder|mentally ill]] where the animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates. Rocket was Halfworld's chief law officer ("ranger") who protected the colony against various threats.<ref name="Hulk271" />

At one point, Judson Jakes tried to steal the Halfworld Bible, but was thwarted by Rocket and various animal associates. Later, Lord Dyvyne abducted Rocket's friend Lylla Otter, and Jakes began the Toy War.<ref name="RRminiNo1" /> As the Toy War continued, [[Blackjack O'Hare]] teamed up with Rocket, and Rocket was reunited with Lylla.<ref name="RRminiNo2" /> The ''Rack 'n' Ruin'' was soon destroyed, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne teamed up to kill Rocket Raccoon.<ref name="RRminiNo3" /> Rocket Raccoon and his friends cured the Loonies of their mental illnesses, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne were apparently killed. Rocket and the animals as well as the robots left Halfworld and took off into space for their own adventures.<ref name="RRminiNo4" /> Some time later, Rocket was revealed to have been a laboratory subject on the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s planet, and escaped his captivity there.<ref name="Quasar15" />

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
Rocket Raccoon resurfaced as a member of the team chosen to accompany [[Star-Lord]] on his mission to stop a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] infiltration of the [[Kree]] homeworld.<ref name="AnnCSL1" /> Rocket is depicted as a gifted military tactician who is fearless, loyal, and insightful. It is heavily implied that he has a case of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]].<ref name="AnnCSL2" /> Rocket's trademark rocket skates are absent.<ref name="AnnCSL1" />

Rocket joins the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] at the behest of his friend Star-Lord.<ref name="GotGv2no1" /> It is he who suggests that the team adopt that moniker after hearing it mentioned by [[Vance Astro|Major Victory]].<ref name="GotGv2no2" /> Later, when the team almost disbands and Peter Quill (Star-Lord) disappears (sent into the Negative Zone by [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]), Rocket keeps the team alive, and brings in [[Groot]] as member, as they had become firm friends.<ref name="GotGv2no8" /> Rocket takes over as leader until they rescue Peter and save the Earth from an alien invasion.<ref name="GotGv2no10" /> When the team tries to halt the growing [[War of Kings]], Rocket leads the portion of the team assigned to make contact with the [[Shi'ar]]. They are unable to teleport into the Emperor [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]'s flagship and have to be rescued by the [[Starjammers]] and Rocket's old friend [[Ch'od]].<ref name="GotGv2no13" /> They are able to bring back the rightful queen of the Shi'ar, but she is killed after Rocket departs, much to his horror.<ref name="WarofK3" />

After the Guardians disband,<ref name="ThanosImpDev" /> Rocket Raccoon takes up a normal job with [[Timely Inc]].<ref name="Annihilators1" /> He and Groot were reunited and tricked into returning to Halfworld: there, he found that his memories of the place were mostly half-truths and deliberately crafted fake memories. In reality, Jakes and Blackjack O'Hare had worked with Rocket in providing security at Halfworld Asylum for the Criminally Insane; ''Doctor'' Dyvyne had been Head of Psychology there; and both the anthropomorphic animals and the automaton clowns were deliberately created to work at the asylum, as their appearance would calm the inmates. The crises that Rocket half-remembered had been caused by the psychic supervillain the [[Star Thief]], who had been admitted as an inmate and used his psychic powers to turn the inhabitants against each other. Rocket had turned the warders into a biological "key" to keep Star-Thief locked up, and deliberately altered his mind and left Halfworld so it could never be opened - but he was tricked into returning by the Thief, whose mind had escaped into the asylum after his host body died.<ref name="Annihilators3" />

When the ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' title was relaunched in 2013, Rocket was again a member of the team.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Steve McNiven|McNiven, Steve]]|inker= Dell, John|story= What exactly do you think you're doing, Mister Quill?"|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 3|issue= 1|date= May 2013}}</ref>

In the first issue of "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]", the Guardians of the Galaxy take part in the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610, in which Rocket and Groot are killed by the Children of Tomorrow.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]|penciller= [[Esad Ribić|Ribić, Esad]]|inker= Ribić, Esad|story= The End Times|title= [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]|issue= 1|date= July 2015}}</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of Marvel's 2015–2019 "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding", Rocket Raccoon takes leadership of the Guardians of the Galaxy while Star-Lord was busy handling things on Spartax.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Schiti, Valerio|inker= Schiti, Valerio|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 4|issue= 1|date= December 2015}}</ref>

During the crisis in ''Avengers: No Road Home'' when light itself was nearly destroyed by the ancient Greek goddess of darkness Nyx, Rocket was one of the heroes who were inadvertently assembled to fight her, including [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Hulk]], the [[Scarlet Witch]], Spectrum, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], Voyager, and [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]. Once Nyx was defeated, Rocket mused that this would allow him to cross "being an Avenger" off his bucket list.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Ewing|first1= Al|author-link1= Al Ewing|last2= Waid|first2= Mark|author-link2= Mark Waid|last3= Zub|first3= Jim|author-link3= Jim Zub|title= Avengers: No Road Home|publisher= Marvel Comics|date= 2019|location= New York, New York|pages= 256|isbn= 978-1302914851}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Rocket Raccoon possesses the normal attributes of an Earth [[raccoon]], including speed (which has been additionally amplified by his training), and an acute sense of smell, sight, hearing and touch. Sharp claws allow him to scale walls, buildings, and trees with ease. He is an accomplished starship pilot, a brilliant engineer and technician, and an expert marksman with the two laser pistols he carries as well as having an affinity for heavy weapons. He is a master military tactician and leader, attributes that help him take charge of the Guardians of the Galaxy when [[Star-Lord]] is unavailable.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

* '''Lylla''' - An anthropomorphic [[otter]]. Lylla is the C.E.O. of the biggest toy making company in the universe, Mayhem Mekaniks on the planet Halfworld. She is also the friend and lover of Rocket Raccoon. She inherited the company after her parents were murdered by Judson Jakes who wanted control of the company. The only way for Lylla to gain full control was through marriage. Lylla soon came under threat not just through Jakes, but also through Lord Dyvyne as they both wanted to control her toy company.<ref name="RRminiNo1" /> Luckily Rocket Raccoon came to her aid and with the help of their friends, WalRus and Uncle Pyko, defeated both parties.<ref name="RRminiNo2" /> Lylla traveled with Rocket afterwards to start a new life together.<ref name="RRminiNo4" /> These events were later revealed to be false. Lylla, along with the rest of the halfworlders, were actually service animals who cared for mental patients on their planet.
