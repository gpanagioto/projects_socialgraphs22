My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  Oh, that's awesome. This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better. That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world. Stuff just happens. You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world. You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money. "Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there." What? I have no idea. I don't know. No. I'm not following you guys any more. Why? Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is." I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore. It's easy. Watch.  No. ...Nope. Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it. I didn't say anything. Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See?  Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes. My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen. The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.
