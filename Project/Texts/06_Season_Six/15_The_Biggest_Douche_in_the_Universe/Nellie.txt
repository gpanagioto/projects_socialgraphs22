Oh, my baby come home! Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine. So nice to have you here, Liane. Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in the oven, too.   Come out now. Come out now. You all come out of ''there'' now. Come on out, spirit. Go! Oooo, that's the potatoes.  Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child. We weren't gonna ask you where you got it from.  Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains. I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas. Here, spirit, come out the window.  I'm just tryin' to persuade it.  Don't let it get in the roast!    This child is clean.
