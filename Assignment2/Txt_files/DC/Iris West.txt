==Fictional character biography==
'''Iris West''' works as a reporter for ''Picture News'', based in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], and is the fiancée of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], who is secretly the Flash. Prior to Barry becoming the Flash, Iris often chides Barry for his frequently being late due to his repeatedly being lost in thought at work as a forensic scientist, a tendency which continues even after he becomes a high-speed superhero. When Iris and Barry marry, Iris learns that, not only is Barry the city's heroic speedster, but her nephew, [[Wally West]], is [[Kid Flash]]. She is not told by Barry, but discovers her husband's secret on their wedding night when Barry talks in his sleep.<ref>{{cite comic|title=The Flash|date=November 1966|volume=|issue=#165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965–1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=120}}</ref> She reveals this to him on their first wedding anniversary.<ref>Flash#174</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=113}}</ref> During this time, the couple discovers that Iris was born in the 30th century.

After years as a prominent presence in the Flash's life and in Central City, She was killed by [[Professor Zoom]] during a costume party. Zoom vibrated his hand into Iris’s head, solidifying it just enough to kill her.<ref>''The Flash'' #275 (July 1979), ''The Flash'' #283 (March 1980), ''The Flash'' #323 (July 1983).</ref><ref name="dc-flash">{{Citation|last = Jimenez|first = Phil|author-link = Phil Jimenez|contribution = The Flash|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 124–127|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Years later, Barry killed Zoom while trying to prevent him from murdering his new fiancée, Fiona Webb.<ref>''The Flash'' #324 (August 1983).</ref> However, Iris did not stay dead for long as Iris' biological parents, the Russells (with the help of a future Flash, John Fox), sent then-infant Iris to the past, where she was adopted by Ira West, her "death" causing a paradox that was resolved after the Russells placed her consciousness into a new body. Barry is reunited with Iris in her time,<ref>''The Flash'' #350 (October 1985)</ref> however, the couple knows that if Barry returns to the past, he will die in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref>As depicted in ''Crisis in Infinite Earths'' #8 (November 1985)</ref> They are able to spend a month together in the 30th century, until Barry is kidnapped by the [[Anti-Monitor]] and returns to 1985.

During their time in the future, they conceive the Tornado Twins, Don and Dawn. Don marries the descendant of Professor Zoom, [[Meloni Thawne]], hoping to end the feud between the two families. They have a son, [[Bart Allen|Bart]], whose powers manifest at an early age and cause him to age at an accelerated rate. Dawn marries Jeven Ognats of Aarok and has a daughter, Jenni. Her powers eventually manifest when she witnesses her father being tortured, and she becomes [[XS (comics)|XS]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Don and Dawn die saving 30th century [[Earth]] from an invasion by the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]].<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #17 (April 1991)</ref>

Iris takes Bart to the past to enlist the aid of her nephew (by then, Wally had taken the mantle of the Flash) in saving her grandson. After Bart's accelerated aging slows down, he takes the name of Impulse. Iris disappears for a while, feeling out of place in the 20th century. She contacted [[Johnny Quick]] at a country diner and tried to warn him of his upcoming battle with [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]], but he did not heed her. Afraid to change the future by giving vital information about the present, Iris refused to go into the details of how Savitar could be defeated, but finally [[Linda Park]] and [[Jenni Ognats]] convinced her to tell them the key to Savitar's defeat, which was to give him what he wanted: to be one with the [[Speed Force]].<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #111 (March 1996)</ref> 

Iris again disappeared. This time she is kidnapped by Polaris and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] and forced to write everything she knew about the future so that they could have a "roadmap into tomorrow" for their plan of world conquest.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #115 (July 1996)</ref> 

After this incident, Iris went someplace where no one would find her so that she could concentrate on writing the book ''The Life Story of the Flash'', which was published by Keystone Press in 1997.<ref>{{Citation|last = Waid|first = Mark|author-link = Mark Waid|title = The Life Story of the Flash, by Iris West|pages = 96|publisher = [[DC Comics]]|year = 1997|isbn = 978-1563893896}}</ref>

Some time later, Iris returns to adopt the child of Wally's ex-girlfriend, officer Julie Jackman, upon her death, having befriended the girl during her time in the present. While in the future, Iris learnt that the child, Josh Jackman, was destined to become a great hero and was believed to be Wally's illegitimate child; however, it turns out that in reality, the child is Mark Mardon's, who had a one-night-stand with Julie after Wally dumped her. Realizing that what was told in the future was wrong, Iris decided to come out of hiding and reconnect with her grandson and nephew.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #180</ref>

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
A mysterious hooded figure enlists the help of Zoom<ref>''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #10</ref> to attack Bart while he confronts [[Captain Cold]], and later reveals herself as Iris. Her plan is to somehow put her grandson, who, by then, had taken up the Flash mantle, out of commission for a week to protect him from a future she is determined to change; however, her plan is corrupted by Bart's clone "brother" [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and a weakened Bart is beaten to death by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].<ref>''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #13</ref>

In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #1, Iris has since moved to her old home in Central City where she is seen tearfully looking over photographs of her late husband, when a disembodied voice calls her name: her late husband, Barry Allen.<ref>''DC Universe'' #0 (June 2008)</ref> Iris spends some time as part of a [[Darkseid]]-resistance cell operating out of the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]] alongside Black Lightning, Green Arrow, the Ray, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] and her two children.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #2 (August 2008)</ref> Soon after, Iris is corrupted by the [[Anti-Life Equation]] but Barry is able to break its hold over her by kissing her & enveloping her in the [[Speed Force]]. Iris starts crying at the sight of Barry, who reassures her everything will be okay.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #4 (November 2008)</ref>

After [[The Flash: Rebirth|the return of her husband]], Iris is shown fully returning to her life alongside the rest of the Flash family. Still overjoyed by the return of Barry, she does not get much time to spend with him, as Barry is still mentally scarred from his deathly ordeal and staunchly refuses to stop and enjoy even a moment of "normal" life.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> She is also shown to be much younger than she previously had appeared (she was depicted as a middle-age woman after the events of ''Crisis''), about the same age as when Barry first met her. It is later implied by the resurrected Professor Zoom that Iris's rejuvenation is a side effect of close contact to her husband's Speed Force since ''Final Crisis''. She resumes her career as a crime reporter at Central City.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010)</ref>

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Iris is not married to Barry, but they still know each other because of their respective occupations. It is hinted that Iris has a romantic attraction to Barry.<ref>''The Flash'' #1</ref> She is accidentally trapped in the Speed Force by [[Top (comics)|Turbine]], but is freed by Barry's alter-ego.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #7</ref> Later issues confirm that she is in love with Barry. Barry does not yet reciprocate Iris' affections, though he hints at it when he's forced to take on the role of the Black Racer and goes to Iris for help.<ref>''Justice League: Darkseid War – The Flash'' #1</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
During the [[DC Rebirth]] events, when Iris and [[Wally West II]] were attacked by Eobard Thawne, Iris had glimpses of her pre-''Flashpoint'' life with Barry, including them as husband and wife and had a family in the other timeline, and learning that he is the Flash in the process. Knowing that Barry is indirectly responsible for the alteration of their lives through time-travel and kept it a secret from her, Iris now distrusts Barry. She also kills Thawne after he lost his powers in retaliation of him hurting Wally II after Barry rescued them,<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #24 (August 2017)</ref> though Thawne later again resurrected from his death. She later appears at the cemetery where Barry asks her for her forgiveness for lying to her. She forgives him, because she is curious about the Flash. He takes her to the Watchtower. She is interested in other secrets Barry is keeping from her. 

Since the Flash Family defeated Grodd and stop the Negative Speed Force from spreading Central City, both she and Barry have rekindled their romances with each other. She is subsequently re-introduced to the pre-''Flashpoint'' Wally West, swiftly regaining her memories of him when she sees him, simultaneously inspiring Wally's own memories of those he has forgotten.<ref> ''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #45</ref> She is later brought to trial in the 25th century for Eobard Thawne's murder. She and Barry later have Wally to be taken care of in the rehabilitation center called the Sanctuary, in which she is so happy about Wally being a better hero today. During her romance with Barry, she begins to remember their marriage, and beginning to put pieces together about the new forces that appear in Central City.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #52</ref>

Five years later, Barry goes to see Iris after Superman lashes out at him for letting Batman get away, where it's shown that they've broken up as Iris is upset with Barry for breaking his promise and supporting Superman.

Iris ultimately rejects Barry and tells him that he's not the man she thought he was.
