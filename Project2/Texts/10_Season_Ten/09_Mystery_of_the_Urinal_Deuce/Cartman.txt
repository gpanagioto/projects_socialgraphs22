Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11. Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle? They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again. Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?! Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards? ...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters!  Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup? Aha! Do you see? I rest my case. That's right, Butters. What? People see the truth? You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  It is wrong for me to ask questions?<br />Is it wrong to seek the truth?<br />I just can't blindly accept their version.<br />I can't base my logic on proof.<br />Almost all the evidence points one way,<br />But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:<br />I need to know what really happened<br />On 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.<br />What really happened<br />On 9/11?[He's back at his computer once more and clicks on his mouse]Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?  Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!   but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane? So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? . Kyle! Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
