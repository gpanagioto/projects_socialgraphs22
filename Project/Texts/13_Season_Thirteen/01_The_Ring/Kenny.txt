(Oh, hi, guys.) (What about her?) (But what?)  (Huh?) (Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!)   (Hey, Tammy!) (Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.) (Yep. I like the food!) (Jonas Brothers?) (Thanks.)  (Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!) (Of course, dude!)  (I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.) (I'd like a box of condoms, please.) (Uhm, I'll take one of those.) (Cool!)  (No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.) (Yep! Woo-hoo!)  (All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!)   (No, no, we're going to your place now!)  (Hey!) (No, fuck that, dude! I bought the fucking tickets!)  (Hey! What the fuck?!) (A purity ring.) (Yeah, it's a purity ring.) (It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.) (I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!) (Yeah.)    (Oh, ''Grey's Anatomy''. Cool! Oh man, this is a great season. Look at all this stuff, so cool.) (Yeah...)  (And not getting a blowjob...) (I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch ''Grey's Anatomy''.) (Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?) (Yeah. Screw this crap!)  (Me too!)
