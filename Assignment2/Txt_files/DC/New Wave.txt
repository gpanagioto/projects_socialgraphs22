They assist [[Baron Bedlam]] and his Soviet-backed invasion of the country of Markovia which results in many soldiers dying during the invasion. The Outsiders attack an enemy camp and encounter the Masters. Learning from a previous encounter, the team defeats the Outsiders.<ref>''Batman and the Outsiders'' #32. DC Comics.</ref>

[[Windfall (comics)|Windfall]] develops sympathetic feelings for the Outsiders and works behind the scenes to keep them alive. Windfall's defection leads to the Masters capturing and cloning her.<ref>''Outsiders'' #14. DC Comics.</ref>

The Masters send Windfall's clone to infiltrate the team. Batman uncovers the ruse. The Windfall clone is then killed during battle while the real Windfall sides with the Outsiders.<ref>''Outsiders'' #19. DC Comics.</ref>
