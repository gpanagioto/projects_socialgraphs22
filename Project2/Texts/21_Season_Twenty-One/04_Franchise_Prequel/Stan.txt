We definitely don't have anyone with superhuman speed in our franchise. Whoawhoa wait, how come we gotta start off with a Netflix series? Can't we just go right into movies? What is it? Spreading lies how? Butters? Butters! Dude, listen. We don't have time for this. Right now, Netflix is buying any show that people pitch them. We have a real shot at starting our franchise, and you are a part of that franchise plan, okay? We have movies planned for the bad guy. Yes! Yeah, nobody believes in us. Aw man, here we go. Dude, this kid is deliberately lying about us on your platform for no other reason than to cause harm! Why are you protecting him?! Oh yes it is.  No, Wonder Tweek is right. It was better when we started the movies off with the Tupperware prequel. Why not? You go with the plan! Maybe we'll just... go and do our own franchise! Yeah dude, civil war. Fuck you!
