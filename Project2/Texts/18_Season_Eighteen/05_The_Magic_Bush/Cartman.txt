 Hey, douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid! No, it isn't. That's stupid. I'm dying of boredom.  What did you say? Your dad has a fucking drone? Whooaa!   You wanna take it out for a spin?  Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone! Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know. Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone! Oh, shit, it's your dad! Go, go, go!  I'll see you later at my house. Butters, is that you?  Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?! Alright, come in.  It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house! Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes. Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush! This thing is recording, right? Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  His dad sees you! Fly back to the house, stupid! Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone! Not a word, Kenny! Hey, you guys. You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush? Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out?  You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.  Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro. Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny? I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it. Whoa, Butters, chillax, bro. Butters- Butters. Butters. Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet! Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it! Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass!  What?  What does that have to do with me? Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude. You were what?! You were spying on me?! But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle! You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that ''not'' spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy!  Butters. Because, Butters-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video. Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one." Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from '''Hunger Games''' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass! Oh hey Butters. Sup? Dude, what's the matter? Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here.  Butters.  Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters. Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones. Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing. Your dad's drone. Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!  Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff. It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom.  Well, you see, Butters, everything worked out.  "Oh, thank you, Eric. I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."  Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy. You're welcome.
