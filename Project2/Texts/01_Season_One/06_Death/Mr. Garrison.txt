Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night. She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called ''Terrance & Phillip''. That's right, Mr. Hat. Shows like ''Terrance & Phillip'' are what we call 'toilet humor'. They don't expand your minds. You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash. Kenny, why are you late to class? Oh, okay Kenny, be seated. Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because... Yes Kenny, what is it? I thought you just came from the bathroom. Okay okay, go ahead. As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. Pay attention children! I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' any more, ever. That's right, children. Are there any questions? Yes, Stanley? What, what do you mean? Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole. Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters. No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me.
