Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous. Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts. Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. You give your mommy a kissy. Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
