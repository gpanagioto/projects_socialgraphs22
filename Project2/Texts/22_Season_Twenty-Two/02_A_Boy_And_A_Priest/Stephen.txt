 Morning, guys. And a Catholic priest raped him.  Oh that was Linda! Hey Randy, what's up?  But where would priests go this late at night? She said, "To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us." Sure, she doesn't care. Well yeah, we got a really weird text from him saying not to worry, he needed to do some camping.
