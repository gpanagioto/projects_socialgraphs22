Shhhh. My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use... That's what I'm doing.  Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son. Yeah, I know how it goes. I ''know''. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud. NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son? Pff, I know, right? Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here.  P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos? Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again! We need to get some bracelets. I'm confused. These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can. You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out.  You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarus need my help. Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now.  I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarus busting my ass! What are you on?! What?  Aw, shit! Yeah... Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us. What can we possibly do? Vengeance is mine!  Get out!  Thank you my children.
