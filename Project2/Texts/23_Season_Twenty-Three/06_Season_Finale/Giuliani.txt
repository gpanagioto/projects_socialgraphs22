Hehey hey, fuck you! Yeah, that's all of them, Mr. President. Ohhh, this is just a conspiracy. It's conspiracy! And we need everyone out there who, who don't think their voices are heard, to make their voices louder! Hello Mr. Marsh? My name is Mr. Giuliani. I've been sent to try and help you. Oh, that sounds like someone who's a little down in the puss. The President said you would be, and he thought you might need a little something special.  Would this make you feel better?  Is this just what the doctor ordered? Go get 'em! Go, go get 'em!
