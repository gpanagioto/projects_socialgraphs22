Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again. Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something? Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.  Ah, hey, Bebe. Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us. Hella fun. Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe. That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool.  So what you do, see, is you wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing.   Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now- Hoh hoh hoh!  ...Wait, what were we doing again? Hey, that's what I wrote about!  That's such a great paper!  Yeah. Uh huh. That would be best. Kyle?? Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out! No! Yeah! Sure thing, Bebe. Yeah.  Where are you guys going? Bebe is ''our'' friend. Didn't you all get the memo?  Hoh! Aw alright, I guess we can all watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' together.  Cartman's?   Hoh, hoh hoh hoh! Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh! Hoh. Hoh?  Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.  Ahta. Ah, ahta!  Ahta. Ahta. Ahta?   Friends. Ahta. Ahta!  Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs. Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions. I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
