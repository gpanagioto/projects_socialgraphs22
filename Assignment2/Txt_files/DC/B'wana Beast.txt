==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
After graduating from college with highest honors, Michael Payson "Mike" Maxwell declined his millionaire father's offer to join the family business and instead decided to join his college roommate, Rupert Kenboya, in [[Africa]] and become a [[Park ranger|ranger]] in the [[Zambezi]] nation's new animal preserves.

When the private aircraft carrying Maxwell and Kenboya to Zambezi was struck by a lightning and crashed at the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the two injured men took refuge in the cavern home of a mutant [[red ape]]. While drinking rainwater that had been filtered through the cavern's mineral laden walls, Maxwell suddenly found he was growing larger, stronger and more ferocious, and was able to subdue the attacking red ape with ease.

Acknowledging Maxwell as its master, the red ape retrieved an ancient [[Corinthian helmet|Corinthian]] styled helmet from the depths of the cave and placed it on Maxwell's head. Through the helmet, Maxwell was able to read the ape's mind and discovered its name was Djuba. He also discovered that the helmet enabled him to control the actions of all other animals. Agreeing that these new powers must be used for the good of all Africa, Maxwell created the identity of "B'wana Beast", and became the Dark Continent's super troubleshooter.<ref name=regrettable>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half Baked Heroes from Comic Book History |date=2015 |publisher=Quirk Books |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59474-763-2 |pages=134â€“135}}</ref>

===''Animal Man''===
In the initial story arc of ''[[Animal Man (comic book)|Animal Man]]'', written by [[Grant Morrison]], B'wana Beast journeys to America to rescue Djuba, who has been captured by scientists and infected with an experimental form of [[anthrax]]. He fails to save Djuba and is himself infected with the disease,<ref>''Animal Man'' #3</ref> but he is cured by [[Animal Man]], who mimics B'wana Beast's powers in order to merge his white blood cells into forms capable of fighting off the disease.<ref>''Animal Man'' #4</ref> In ''Animal Man'' #13 (July 1989), also written by Morrison, Maxwell decides to retire and performs a ceremony to find a successor. He passes the helmet and elixir on to a [[South Africa]]n activist named Dominic Mndawe, who assumes the name [[Freedom Beast]].<ref>''Animal Man'' #13</ref>

Mike Maxwell returns in ''Animal Man'' #47 (May 1992) written by [[Tom Veitch]], after a long period of absence, in which after hearing the call of the destructive force called the Antagon, he is corrupted and possessed, and transformed into the evil '''Shining Man'''. With his new identity, Maxwell wreaked havoc on Earth until he was killed in a fight with Metaman.<ref>''Animal Man'' #47-50</ref>

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), B'wana Beast is considered as a possible new member for the [[Justice League International]] by [[United Nations]] head of intelligence Andre Briggs. They decide he is not right as a candidate for the team at that time, and he is not invited to join, but it is unknown whether he will become a member later.<ref>''Justice League International'' vol. 3 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
B'wana Beast drinks an elixir that gives him great strength, speed, hunting and [[tracking (hunting)|tracking]] abilities. He also wears an ancient helmet that allows him to communicate with animals,<ref name=S66/> and to [[wikt:merge|merge]] up to four animals together to form a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=123}}</ref> For the most part, once these animals are merged, B'wana is able to acquire their aid in situations of need. Whether this is due to his ability to communicate with them or an instinct on their part is not known.<ref>''Showcase'' #67</ref>
