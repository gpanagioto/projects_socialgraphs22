 Hey Steve, how're you doin'? I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere? Oh my gosh. You know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you. Uh huh. You're right, Steve. Some changes ''do'' need to be made.  Clean that shit up. That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers. Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety. Certainly. Uh, Eric, right? Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want. Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
