 Dude! We've been waiting forever! H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something. What?!  I ''am'' socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak. All right, sorry guys. So where to now?  This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed! He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair. Oh my God, he killed Kenny!  Whoever he is, he is one tough badass. Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us! Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway! Dude, we have to try. Come on, let's do this! Look! There he is! Dad?? Dad, get off our teamspeak line!  That's it, screw this game! Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time. We can't ''get'' to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests! I'm in.  +15 agility. 'K. That's Ã¼bercool. Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire. Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us. Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong? Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad!  Hurry dude! Kyle, you have to keep playing. We can't do this without you now! Come on!  You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor! Dude, I'm almost dead.  Dad? Not now! Dad, how did you get that?! Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I... I got it!  Dad! Dad, no!  Dad? Dad? I know you do, Dad. We did it! Yeah. I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now? Got it.
