But then what exactly is your superpower? And shoot lasers out of my eyes.  When was that?  Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die. Dude! Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next? Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from. You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason! You should fuck off, that's what you should do. Wait, Mintberry Crunch ya you might not wanna go-  There's no double rainbow, fatass! Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us! Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy! Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!  We aren't going that way! What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here. Kenny, where the hell are you going? You... you crazy bastard!  And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs.  You're not going anywhere for a long time! Well, come back and visit any time, dude. Kenny? No! Nooo!
