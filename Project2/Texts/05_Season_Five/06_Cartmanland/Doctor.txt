You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you.  I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run.   I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life. There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live. Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I-- He's coming back. Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission!
