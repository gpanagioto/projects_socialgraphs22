 My doctor says I'm not supposed to. I don't wanna have cancer!  But why me, coach? Why? Oh.  Hi, coach. Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die? How come I have to die now? I mean, how come I don't get to grow up? I'm sorry. I think so. Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer? Well then, will you just... win for me? Coach. I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?  Oh. My cancer hurts. Wow.  At the Pepsi Center? That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach? All right! Maybe there IS hope for me. No hope. No... hope...
