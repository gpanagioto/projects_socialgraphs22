Go, dude, go!   Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles! ''That's'' not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis! Get away from me, Cartman!   AAAAAAAAAA!  You guuuys! I think so. Is Cartman up there? Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat. I don't think so. Sick, dude!  Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here. Dude, it's a dude! Wow. Cool. Yeah, sweet! Maybe ''we'' can get a reward for the ''frozen'' guy! I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let ''them'' figure out what to do with it. No, dude! We have to name it Steve. It's ''my'' name, and ''I'' found him. What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was! Kenny, who found the ice man? But we found a frozen ice man from the past!  No. ''I'' found this frozen guy in the woods today. We came for our reward. Sweet. How about Steve?  Gorak's a gay name. Why are you being such a dick? Nuh-uh! I'll go. You bastards! Good job, dude! You freaked him out! Guess what? ''You're'' not my best ''friend'' anymore! Cartman's my ''new'' best friend! Fine!  No, he sure doesn't. Well, I was talking to Cartman, too! He's ''my'' creature! But it isn't right! What?! I'm not talking to you!   I'm here to bust out Steve. His name is Steve! Steve! Steve! Be''cause'', he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man. Does so! You're a dick! You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me! Well, why don't we make ''3'' o'clock?   Steve, wait! I've got something to show Steve, ''dick!'' Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look! It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines! No you ''don't'', butthole! We have to get our friend, Steve- -to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away. Frosty, Steve, whatever. ''Oh.'' We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now. Okay. First one to die, loses. Okay.  So, here we go.  Go.   Oh.  Oh. Okay, it's over this way. Later. Uh huh. Cool. His name... is Steve! Steve! Steve, look out! Steve, look out! I can't believe he's gone. Hey! No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him. Me too. He sucks.
