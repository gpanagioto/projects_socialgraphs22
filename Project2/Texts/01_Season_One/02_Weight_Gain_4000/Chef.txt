 Hello there children. How are my little crackers today? Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park. Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked <i>me</i> to sing at the ceremony. Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation. Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. <poem><i>Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.</i></poem> <poem><i>How 'bout you and meee-</i></poem> <poem><i>-get together and make... sweet... </i></poem> love? He needs to run his ass around the block a few times. Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
