The truth is we still know very little about Asperger syndrome, Mrs. Marsh. All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.  Good morning Mr. Mathers.  We've got a new patient, Martin. I want you to meet Stan.  Oh uh, we'll be done at about 5 pm, Mrs. Marsh. I'll call if it's any earlier. Alright, are we clear?
