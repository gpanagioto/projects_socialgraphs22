Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous. Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?  Aw, come on guys, give me a break. Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad! I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.
