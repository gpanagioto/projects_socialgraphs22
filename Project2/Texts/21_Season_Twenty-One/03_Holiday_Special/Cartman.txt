 You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday! Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated! Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan! Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters. And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle. Yeah, this is sweet. It's like that movie where the dude pretended to be on the monsters' side? You know, with the guy and the chick that had the wife beater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them?  Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?  What? What? What the hell was that? Yeah, get meaner, Kenny. Just talk about cutting off his dick or something. Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick. Guys, what are you going? I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way- Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said "Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!"
