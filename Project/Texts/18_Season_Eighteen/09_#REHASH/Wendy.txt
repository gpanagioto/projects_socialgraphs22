Hi everybody. I love you! So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  So can you explain to our audience members ''over the age of five'' what it is that you DO? And why do you think young people-? ...Why do you think young people are responding to this?
