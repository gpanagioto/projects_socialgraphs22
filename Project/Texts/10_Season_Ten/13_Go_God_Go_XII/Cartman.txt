Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.  Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere. Over here!  Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans.  I got it! I got the Wii!   Get out of my way! Here.   Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play! There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future! You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-dammit! I am so fucking sick of the future!  I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut! Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood. God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials!  Tell me about it.  What? Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?! Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to ''freeze'' myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii. I care! Where's the closest toy store?? Come on! Come on! Ugh, finally! I want one of those time-phone things. Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people. Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?! Look, I have to have one of those phones! How about a robot? How much for the robot?  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records? I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week. Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.   Oh God!  Who is this? What?? Who the hell is this?! Me who?! What?! Oh very funny, Kyle! Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself. Listen to this!  Butters?! Come on, we gotta go! Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark! What??  Who the fuck is this?! Suck my balls! ...Okay, you have one minute.  Are you spying on me?! Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going! This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?! What is the Great Question? I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?! Who? Garrison? But he's an asshole. It's an emergency! It's an emergency! I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now! Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation! Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison!   Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism? So there is no war now in the future.  And what was that purpose again? Right...  I'll miss you too, KOK-A-3. Hoowww-  I'm back. Wow! I'm back! Mom! Mom, they did it!  No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out. What? NO!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over! I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this! Hello? ...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle!
