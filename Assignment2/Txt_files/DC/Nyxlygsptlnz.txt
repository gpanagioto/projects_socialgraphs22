==Fictional character biography==
A character named Miss Gzptlsnz first appeared in the comic book series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]''. Ms. Gzptlsnz was a female imp from the same fifth-dimensional plane as [[Mister Mxyzptlk]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=260–261}}</ref> The character was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Curt Swan]], and first appeared in ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #52 (April 1964), where Mxyzptlk referred to her as his girlfriend, though Gzptlsnz developed a crush on [[Jimmy Olsen]]. Miss Gzptlsnz had similar implike proportions to Mxyzptlk. She reappeared in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #31 (July 1999) as the leader of a council of 5th dimensional imps passing judgement on [[Qwsp]].

Gsptlsnz is later seen in "[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]" when Mxyzptlk is pulled through a portal by [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]], and again when Mxyzptlk escapes.<ref>''Countdown'' #31 (September, 2007). DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Countdown'' 24 (November 14, 2007). DC Comics.</ref>

Her real name is '''Nyxlygsptlnz''', also referred to as Ms. Gspltlnz, and she is the wife of Mr. Mxyzptlk and daughter of King Brpxz. She grants Clark a wish, and makes everyone forget that Clark Kent's death occurred. She is also revealed to be aunt of Ferlin Nyxly, a Superman villain and museum curator also reintroduced to the new continuity.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #12 (October 2012)</ref><ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #0 (November 2012).

*An attractive human-appearing Ms. Gsptlsnz appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Sandra Bernhard]] in "Mxyzpixilated" and [[Jennifer Hale]] in "Little Big Head Man. She appears as the girlfriend of Mr. Mxyzptlk. Unlike her hyperactive, wild, and crazy partner she is more laid back and indifferent to mortals. As an Imp from the 5th dimension, she shares the same powers as Mr. Mxyzptlk and isn't bound by third dimensional laws. She appeared in the episodes "Mxyzpixilated" and "Little Big Head Man".
*Nyxlygsptlnz (AKA Nyxly) appears in the sixth season of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Peta Sergeant]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=April 9, 2021|title='Supergirl': Peta Sergeant Joins Season 6 As New Series Regular|url=https://deadline.com/2021/04/supergirl-peta-sergeant-nyxly-final-season-cw-series-1234730718/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210409171029/https://deadline.com/2021/04/supergirl-peta-sergeant-nyxly-final-season-cw-series-1234730718/|archive-date=April 9, 2021|access-date=April 14, 2021|work=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref> Kara meets her in the Phantom Zone when she saves her and Zor-El from Scar by claiming that the Phantoms and the White Martians are coming their way. While mentioning her history with Mister Mxyzptlk, Nyxly states that she was a princess who was banished to the Phantom Zone by her father King Brpxz who also killed her brother Bryxly. While having a bracelet that negates her abilities, Nyxly managed to sneak a 5th Dimensional Orb with her. To help Kara rescue Zor-El, Nyxly breaks her bracelets at the cost of her 5th Dimensional Orb. With her powers regained, Nyxly heals Kara's leg and helps to rescue Zor-El. When a mirror that would serve as one of the exits to the Phantom Zone is found, Kara discovered that Nyxly has her own plans with the mirror where she plans to go to Earth in order to get back to the 5th Dimension and get revenge on her father. During the struggle, Kara accidentally sets off the self-destruct sequence and sacrifices the mirror to keep Nyxly from going through. Nyxly survived the building's explosion and secretly stows away on top of the Tower following Supergirl and Zor-El's rescue. After allowing Nia's mother to be revived for a day, Nyxly ran into the hunter Mitch and collaborated with him in a plot to trap Supergirl by having Dr. Desmond Raab build a cryo-bomb. When it was destroyed by Supergirl, it was revealed to have helped Nyxly regain her powers. Using her powers, Nyxly incapacitates Supergirl's legs in ice and destroys the Ormfell Building. With Supergirl vulnerable to magic, she calls for Mxyzptlk. Nyxly does different attacks to draw out Mxyzptlk until he surrenders to her. Nyxly then uses an orb to absorb Mxyzptlk where she uses the orb to find the totems she needs. After obtaining some of the Totems and being aided by an A.I. modeled after her that was placed in a Lexosuit she received, she is then visited by Lex Luthor who gave her the Lexosuit with the A.I. made from a future Nyxly. Lex aids her in hunting for the remaining totems. Though this becomes stained due to Lillian and their competition once the AllStone is put together and split into three pieces. When Lex Luthor opens a portal to the Phantom Zone to summon the Phantoms, Lex and Nyxly are dragged in by the Phantoms due to their hubris.
