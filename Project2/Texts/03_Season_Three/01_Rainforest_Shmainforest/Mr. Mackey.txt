Why can’t you behave? What do you have to say for yourself?! <i>[nothing]</i> Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- <i>[Craig sticks his right middle finger up]</i> Did you just flip me off? Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- <i>[Craig flips Mr. Mackey off again]</i> There! You just flipped me off again! Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! <i>[Craig hops off the chair as the door opens. The boys enter.]</i> Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. <i>[Craig exits]</i> Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation- Uh, young man, "Getting Gay With Kids" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors. Well, guess what, boys? I think that "Getting Gay With Kids" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you. I think this will be very good for you <i>[writes their names down]</i> And that's exactly why you need to go! <i>[rushing in]</i> Sorry I'm late. Oh, no problem. <i>[to El Presidente and his men]</i> Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien? Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour. <i>[approaching]</i> Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente) Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?) Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...) Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llega- llegarán. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.) No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estarán aquí. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.) Estoy seguro que llegarán. Eh-sólo poquito más de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time) Mbien.
