We'd better get back to the station, sir. What is it, Lou? Aw, come on, sir. Jesus, how did he...? The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy.  Sir? We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.  All right, here's a hundred dollars. This body also had a missing hand ''and'' a bowl of corn flakes next to it! We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again. Quiet! He's havin' a vision!  Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, bus driver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much. Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing. I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman.  ...Sir? ...Restraint? Sarge! In here!  Sir? Right. Ohhh.  Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.  Heh- sir? Sarge...  What is it? Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer? You're certainly a better psychic then Eric. Do you think that's true?
