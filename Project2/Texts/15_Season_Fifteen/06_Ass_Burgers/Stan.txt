  I just want everything to go back to the way it was. How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy?  Wait, it's not a real illness?  Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!  Yeah. Who are you people? Huh? Aliens? Because of aliens?  Yeah I'm ready! Ahhhh!  Oh coool!  Adam Sandler's funny.   Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical! Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.  You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal! ...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept?  Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!  I feel like total shit. The rock creatures? Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any... Ugh God.   ...Enchirito? What? You guys are aliens? Dude, I don't know! I'm not friends with him. No, no, we don't hang out anymore. Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-! I don't know! Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger. How do you guys make them so yummy?  Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me. Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault! Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying. Just stop it! You people are so full of shit! No, I'm done with that!  I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  Or maybe this kid will. Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited.   What? No, dad, no. No, please! No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn. ...K, coming.
