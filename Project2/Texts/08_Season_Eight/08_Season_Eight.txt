 Stop it, Cartman!   Wow, cool.  Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?! Kaii yo!  Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.  No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.  You don't know anything about Jews, fatass! I still say this is a bad idea. But don't tell anybody we have them. Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next. God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers! No asshole! From now on you only get to have ''one'' power! So what is it?! That doesn't count, fatass! Who the hell is that? Whoa. Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto!  Okay, okay, you can have your powers back. God dammit Cartman! What the hell did you do ''that'' for, Kenny?! Oh man! We are in serious trouble! I agree with Cartman! You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons! Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain! If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.  God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again. Oh no. That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd ex''pect'' this stupidity out of Cartman, but ''you'', Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now! We need some more fur.  I think that's good. We've gotta hurry, it's getting late!  Quick, hide Butters!  He said, not now, Craig! I swore to never fight again. Oh no. Butters!  Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters! Butters! Hey Butters! Dude, look!  Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you? Yeah, we know. Butters! It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably ''know'' we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence!   Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything. We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now! Screw you, fatass!   I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I... Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these! Where?! Then it's ''not'' too late! We have to get past them! You have ''that'' power too? Oh dude, we are gonna get it now. Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?  Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished! Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.  So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons. They're Olympic games for handicapped people. Yeah, that'd be cool. Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys. ...You're an asshole, Cartman. What? Oh no. Cartman, no!  Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics! Because!   God damn you! No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a ''parent'' with you to sign up for the Special Olympics. It says ''right there'' "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha!  Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive.  I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it! I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!  I came here to talk about you! I'm a Vulcan!  The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing. No! I'm on the away team too!  I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again! I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge.   No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again! Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything! He does not! Naw uh! I'm not arguing about ''The Passion''! He's being an asshole! People don't hate the Jews! ...You're a stupid asshole!  One please. Yeah, I know, but I have to- ...Thanks.  Haaaah!  How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus? You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know. You were, you were right? You were right.  Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh!  Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over. Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord. Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus ''wasn't'' really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night. But how can the Jews make it better?? Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus. If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it. I saw ''The Passion''!  Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!   Dude, what's wrong with him? Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie? Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche.  Sweet. I made mine go off the jump.  Hey, who are those kids? ...What the hell just happened? Yeah. Dude, that is a sweet RC car! We're not interested, thanks. Yeah! Go Stan! All right Stan! Yeah! You got served! That's right! What the hell are you doing, fatass? Why? Why? Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top. Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.  Hey Look! Hey. Do you live here? Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do?  What's wrong with his face? Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up. Mr. Jefferson? Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house. Dude, what happened to your knee?  Mr. Jefferson! Mr- ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up.  Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. I know, I know. Be cool. So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters? And where is ''your'' mom? You must have a mom. You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what? What? So you never met your mom? Yeah. Yeah, that counts. You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid. Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to ''be'' a kid, not have one. They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat? Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard. He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home. What?! Come on, Blanket.  That poor kid. Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?  Jesus Christ, dude! Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him! All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.  Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay?  Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. You bastard!  Come on!  Hang on, Blanket!  All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit! Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up! All right! Things just might work out! You've been on your fucking phone since we started! A break from what?! You haven't done anything! All you ever do is talk about your balls! If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us! Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it. Dude.  What?! Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in ''our'' time, then they should learn ''our language''! Aw, dude.  This is really gay. Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche." Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche. It was ''my'' idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier! Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich? Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?  That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche. You ''hate'' Butters. You misled him, fatass! Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier. A giant douche. Giant douche. A giant douche. All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche." Cartman? What the hell?! You won't get more votes than us, asshole! Be sure to vote for Giant Douche. Giant Douche is your man! Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich.  There. Do you really want that asshole to win? What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the ''Rock the Vote'' stuff or, or Puff Daddy's ''Vote or Die''?! Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy. You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now? Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part. Woah... wait, what are you doing? No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich. ...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche. Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?! Well, I just figured you'd vote for ''my'' guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy! Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche. Ha! You lose, fatass! That is fucking stupid, Cartman! Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish? Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie? You only need one copy, r-tard! Okay, fine, I will!  Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night.  Why, Mr. Farkle?  Cartman, stop it! See?! That sucks, dude! Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  What the hell?  Butters? What the hell are you doing? But you ''run'' the Wall-Mart. You hate Wall-Mart, too?  No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.  It wasn't ''my'' idea to burn the Wall-Mart down. Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the? How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here? Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?! But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here! Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all! No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart. Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha! I was working for Wall-Mart all along!" or something. All right, fine. Come on, fatass!   I heard that! You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart! He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding! God-damnit!  It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires! Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town. We want to talk to who's in charge. So how do we stop it? The heart of Wall-Mart? All right. C'mon you guys. We have to get back home.  All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it. I knew you were! Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this! Yes, I did! Yes, I did! Yes, I did! Yes. I did!   -and I told you that-  We've gotta find the television department.  I think I see the television department in the back! Who are you? Where's the heart? The question is, "Where is the heart?" The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out NOW!  All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back. Duh. Okay, hang on a second I- All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you? Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?! Oh, no! No! Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. Yeah. Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool. Totally, dude, let's play Fireman. Shut up, fat ass! Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool!  Do you know how to start a fire? We're firemen! Code 7! Bring in the firemen!  We saved the school! My mom is gonna break my legs! Not us. We're good kids. Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us! We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident! Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it. That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years! Dude, we shouldn't be here! We need you to protect us... from a bully. Well...  Well, what do you want? Wait! We'll do it. Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes? What else has big round squishy globes?   Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.  God, I hope this works.  Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?  Naw. Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up! Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!  We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible! From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders. So you're gonna help us? The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids. Our lives have ''not'' been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you!  Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be ''really'' mad!  Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They ''were'' ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit. What?! Geez, all that from a stupid video show.  Gah, I just don't get it. Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air! How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry. Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on. Maybe we need to make students think they ''have'' to watch our news show or they'll die.  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle. We're making the news more appealing to students. We beat ''Close-up Animals''! Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig. What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no. Uhhh. What if the-? Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine! That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads. How do we know which one to use? It's not? Oh, okay.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise. Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?  I could watch this for days.  Ah! Butters, get away from me! I wrote down... all the lyrics to the ''Happy Days'' theme song. Jesus, you may be right.  Twenty-two people?! All right! Dude, bail?  What's going on? Do it! Do it! Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly! Awww, go on and do it already!  Cartman, what did you do?! Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it! Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why! You don't have any powers! He can't do crap! Ha! You see?! What?! This is fuckin' ridiculous! What the hell is wrong with these people?! Hey! What about this guy?! Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!  I'm pretty sure he's your man. No. Why won't anybody listen to me?!  I ''am'' taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman. Be sure to take me to the same hospital! All right, here we go.  I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m. No, don't you see? Cartman never ''had'' psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.  There's a logical explanation for that.  What the hell? My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas. Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus. No. I'm Jewish. Huh?  Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!  No, I ''want'' to have the Antichrist inside me!  With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!  Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!  Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story! This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again! Dude, why do you care?! Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved! All right, fine! HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil! Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist. Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.  Goddammit, Cartman! Pfaha, so funny.  Yeah. We won't have to take crap from ''anybody''. Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?! I'm gonna get those killer sai.  for a dollar ninety nine. Parents? Parents?!  Why?!  Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!  Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies. Kick ass!  Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous. Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine! Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, ''The Passion'', and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true. Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig.   Look what we got.  Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy. Ugh. Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas! Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome! We're playing Ninjas, Butters. No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us. Yes, and no time to do it. No time...  Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it. I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers. I have the power to have all the powers I want.  C'mon! Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys. That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass! All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain! All right! And now I will use my power to...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya! Oh, shit, dude! Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard. Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character. Shut up, Butters.  Dr. Shafley? So if we make Butters up to look like a dog... Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here.  Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole! Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters. Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot. In here!  No way, you got weapons too?! Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!  We're twice the ninjas ''you'' fags are! Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa! Butters! Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here ''right now''! We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code! Here, Butters! Butter- Butters! Here, Butters!  Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things! Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try. Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true.  All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by. I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  Here, hold this stuff for me. What? I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction.  Hey, fuck you, Kyle!  The ''Special'' Olympics? What's so special about them?  What? Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement. What? What'd I do?  You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich! Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"  So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just ''pretended'' to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks! It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps! Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see.  Why? What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is. Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye! Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr. You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now. What?!  Moooommmm? Um, could I get you to do something for me? Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars?  I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special. ...I'll split the money with you.   Help me change? Awesome.  Naaaa! Daaaaa! Naaaa! Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa! ...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa! Enter.  Go on, Kyle. Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew. Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul. Yes.  One thousand dollars, yeah!  Daaaa! Daaaa! Whoa. What the hell??  Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.  God-damnit! All right, this one I can win!  God-damnit! Ah, screw you hippies! ...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!  Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.   Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine. What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew? All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew? All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.  It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle! Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible. Set phasers on stun. Yes. A little too quiet. Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle! Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for! Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along! Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, ''The Passion'', and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil! How do you know?! I've seen ''The Passion'' thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it. Go see the movie, Kyle! You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.  Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of ''The Passion'' then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson. Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Mom! Doorbell!  Mom! Answer the door! God damn it, lazy-ass whore.  It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?  Mmm, one more time, Kyle. I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen. Mel Gibson's ''The Passion'' Fan Club. Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m. What? You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes. If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick. Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall! Bitch?! Don't call ''me'' bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open! I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch! Eup.  Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved ''The Passion'' as much as I did.  Tell them I'll be down shortly  Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by ''The Passion'' like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done. But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.   all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see ''The Passion''. Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean. One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie! And as we march for ''The Passion'' we should also ''voice'' our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung," you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."  Es ist Zeit fër Rache!  Es ist Zeit für Rache! Es ist Zeit für Rache! Nice.  Es ist Zeit für Rache! Es ist Zeit für Rache!  Juden! Mel! Gibson!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?! Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution! Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass.  Ha! You just got f'd in the a! Yeah! All right! All right, Butters!  Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000. I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot. Yes. I will be your new best friend. Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.  Really? Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.  That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets. Oh, really? Heh. Wow, that sucks. Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart. Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you. What? You saw that? Nuh uh. No way.  ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters? Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape? Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.  Oh, son of a bitch! AWESOM-O does not have a mom.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears? I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video? What? Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function. ...No way. Weak!  Lame! AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading. Where is it? Where is it?! Wah! Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you. AWESOM-O understands. Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape! I would like some Sunny Delight too.   I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer. Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay? Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?  Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Weak. Yes, of course.  Suck my balls, Kyle.  Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere. What? Lame. AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please? Thank you.  Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming.  Argh!  Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps? The New Orleans Saints.  Seventeen.  Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something. Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something. You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.  Haaaa! Haaaa! AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint. Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut. ...What? AWESOM-O does not understand.  Lame! Not cool! Totally lame!  Waaaaa! Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa! Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?! The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?! I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive! I said I'm a real person, asswipe! Goddamnit, get me down from here!   I'm not a robot, I'm a human! Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!  Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real! Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am!  I am the AWESOM-O 4000. Uh... now ending fart sequence. Smell sequence initiated. Lame... I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs.  No. Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels.  Oh my God, this is awesome!   Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world! Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!  They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train. Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come! Choo-choo train! Yay! ''Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.'' Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you. ''...Train together'' ''I've got time. Do youuu??'' ''Choo-choo train.'' Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight! You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want! Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?! You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away! He is ''my'' friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I- Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson! Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend! Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said ''we'' were best friends.  Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls!  Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember? Mr. Jefferson, hello?!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery! Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child?  Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars? Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am! It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  What? Dude, I'm takin' a break. Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers. It works, doesn't it? Did I ''not'' just get us an extra five bucks? Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass! Shoveling accident. You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it. What?! Who?! We can't understand you, asshole!  Look, it's working!  Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other. Butters, shut the hell up!  Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot. Ye-heah! Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich." Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be ''so'' funny! It is not! Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week. Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a ''super funny'' turd sandwich? It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it. A turd sandwich. Turd sandwich. Turd sandwich. Awwwww! Okay. You win, Kyle. All right turd sandwich! Giant Douche sucks! Game on, Jew-boy! Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow! We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot. Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy? Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school? You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd ''and'' the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives. So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes? Well then, perhaps we could interest you in   Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings. Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move. Oh, no! Noooo!! You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants. Yeah, when you die, your ''jowels'' release and crap comes flying out your ass.  Oh yeah?! I'll bet you ''five bucks'' that when you die you crap your pants, asshole! Whoa, awesome!  Dude, check it out! ''Time Cop'' on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks! Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks! Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight! Dude, you can't shop for crap.  Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper? What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle. What? That's called progress, Kyle. ... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks.   Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle! You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you? No, but ''you'' got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it. Oh, awesome!    Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out. Nuh-uh. I am not, Kyle!  Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart. You heard what? That's not what I said!   Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!  I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do! Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much? You speak too much, sir!  That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!  I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along! No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. ...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-  Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off. Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on? Really? That's cool. When did-  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at ''us'', Trent Boyett?! Oh, Holy Jesus, God... It's true. He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men. Jews can't ''be'' firemen. Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew! But how do we start a fire? Don't worry, Trent. Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing! Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did. Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. Whatever. That's like five years from now. Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents! You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart! We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters! Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!   Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool. I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts. Nononono, you gotta go  "But Mo-o-o-om."  "But ''Mo-o-o-om''." Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks. Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now. Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff! All right! You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world! Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass. Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.  A picture of your mom's boobs? A lot of stupid things that we regret. Aaaaaaaah! Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth.  Stay away from us, Trent! It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man! I am ''not'' going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters! Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. Whatever, that's like five years from now. We did it!  Uh oh. Hah! Hey! And I'm Rick Cartman. Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.  ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities? All right, Butters, keep your eyes open. Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right. Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip. All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice.  How many students is that? What is that butthole doing now?! Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing. ...You're gay! Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.  God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park. Go play with yourself, Craig.  Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?! It should be Sexy News. Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting. Nice, Butters, write that down! And panda bears for the preschoolers. We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means. Ah, Tolkien, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Tolkien, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Tolkien, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona. You see Tolkien, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... ''Seeing'' African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha-, how should I say... white.  Tolkien, all the great African-Americans news people have learned to ''hide'' their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings. Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls! And now, for a look at the weather, here is Tolkien Black, and Tolkien, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.  Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?  Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters. All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle. Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got skidmarks Monday. It's boring news, Jimmy. All right, tell me about it.  Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about? Oh man, this is ''so'' great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you!  I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade! How about we have us, um... hmmm. Wait, I've got it.  Crab people. They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.  Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies! How about we do a show where we kill Butters?  We have crab people. Just sayin'. That sounds perfect.  Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.  Stan, are you getting good ideas?  Oh dude, I just got the best idea! Dude, this TV show is awesome. I-I did. I wrote something down.   They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse. And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.  Haha! In your face, Craig! This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head.  ...I think bail. "Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."   Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party. Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me. Kelly Rutherford-Menskin. Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?  Oh, Goddammit! This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.  ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here. I'm gonna! Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to- Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations. And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight!  Eugh...  Wheh? Where am I? Coma... How long? Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap! Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours! Probably in your front pocket, dumbass! Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch. I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?! How come the outline is missing its hand? Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs! Guess again. Wow! Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks!  Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes? Do not doubt my powers, Kyle! Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought! Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at!  What? I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go! No. Nothing. Wait a minute.  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken! It ''is'' fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae. More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring. Proper channels? I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.  Ten percent, my balls, get lost! Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds! In court? Cool.  Who are you? ... 'Kay. Sweet. Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?! I don't even know you dude! Oh, Jesus. No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!  Heheh. Yes yes, I see!  AAAAAAAH! Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me!  (Hey! Come over here!)  No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested. Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability. You can't hurt me. I don't believe anyone interrupted ''you'' when you read ''your'' Christmas story aloud, Kyle.  Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?  Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends. That's not at all what happens.  "Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat. Come on and take a look, folks. We've got a lot of knives for sale here.   Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission.  Wha- wha- what's the matter?   Can I help you boys? Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds. I thought you told me your parents were dead. Oh my God, look!  Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas. Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  Those are so sweet. Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons. We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year. Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.  Kiya! Kiya!  With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like. What's your ninja name, Kenny? All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world! Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it. Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig! We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff. Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East. Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do.  Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state!  Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do. Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction. Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with! Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have ''any'' powers! I dunno. Craig, is that you?  Hey kid, that knocks you down. Yeah, huh, I got you! Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!  Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really. Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay!  Dude, shut up! What?! Just stay still, Butters. God dammit! We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian? He's really old and going blind. We might pass him off as our pet. All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened. All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.  Oh shit, somebody's coming! Where'd you get those? Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going. Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay?  We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah!  Hey, wait, wait, ''wait'', wait!   Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him! No dude, you gotta help us find him! Butters! Butters! Bad. Nothing, just... playing. Butters! What? Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back. It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them. All right, the county fair's still open!  We have come to return the weapons we purchased. What is it, Craig? Come on, Ninjas!  Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.  Oh, Jesus. What? Just run with it, dude. Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.  We've got some more work to do. Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy. Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on. So? That's really, ''really'' terrible, dude. Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated. Things seem pretty quiet. Oh God, here we go again. That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about ''The Passion''! I'm out of here. Look at that, dude. ''The Passion'' has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.  Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too. Dude. That movie sucked. How can they even call that a movie? That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back. Hey, we want our money back. That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars. That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film! You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours! We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back! W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson? Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny!  Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see ''The Passion''. No, no, no, no, we want our money back. We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him? Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back! Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass! I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me! Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!   Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu! We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for ''BASEketball''! Thank you.  Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny. Uh, we saw your movie, ''The Passion'', and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please? Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money. Tor- torture you? We don't want to torture you. Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you? Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy! Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny?  All right, let's get the hell out of here!  Aah! Run, dude, run! Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters. Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.  Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up. Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster. I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna-  Yeah. I told you that! He wouldn't give us our money back for ''The Passion'', so we kinda took it. He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind. It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked! No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results. Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one.  Chef, we just got served. Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess- Some, kids from Orange County. No. But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'. But Dad-  What? I thought I was supposed to! But why? I, I don't know. He seems all right.  Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad. Okay, good.  God dammit! Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right? Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe? Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.  Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it? Great!  All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance. The arcade? Dude, he's incredible.  Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe? Yeah.  Dude, we need you. It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us. All right, that's three! Huh? Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go! Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick. And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County. So you'll do it? All right, we just need one more person! What? The state tap champion is from here? Who? Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean... Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe. It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago.  But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska. We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion. Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member? A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park. All right, so you're sure he can dance? Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to? My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe. Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer. We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we? Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like-  I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you. Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country. Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault. Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that. Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant. And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward. But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.  What? What happened?? Aw, what do we do, Chef?! Butters!  All right Butters! Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot? Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.  What's that you're wearing? Whoa. Dude, no way! Dude, are these all your toys?  Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something. Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons! I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons. Yeah. It's just a dad and his son. Fine, Mom. No, my parents are. What?  Kyle? Mr. Jefferson Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning! Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow! He just showed up here. Jesus Christ! I know. He's here. No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home. Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now! Ahaa! Yeah. A ''really'' bad dream. Oh Jesus! You don't have to tell ''us'' twice, Mom. That guy's a freak! Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us. Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood. Stop, you fucking lunatic!  You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe. Blanket, you in here? All right dude, get in his bed. Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something.  Go, go, ruuun!   Oh Jesus! Oh my God, he killed Kenny! Run, Blanket, Run! Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages? Cartman, just keep your mouth shut. Whoa. Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future! Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em. Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool. Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today? All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house.  Son of a bitch!  Oh, they took our jobs! I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to-   Who is that? Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs! Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away. I wanted my job! Timecist? People from the future. Right, got it. That's right!  Can you speak in present-day English please? Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.  No, a double cheeseburger and fries! What?! I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger! No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a goddamned cheeseburger and some goddamned fries you fucking goobacks! Aw- awwww! Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you? They took yer jarb!! I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work. We're doing it! Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay. Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile.  But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win! This is bullcrap, dude! Dude, I really don't care.   Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot? I'm not voting! I just think this whole thing is stupid!  It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point. Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care. Puff Daddy? I... "Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that even mean?! Aaaah! ...Okay. I'll vote. I guess...  Okay.  I'm voting. Yeah, I know.  I thought I was supposed to make my own decision. Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for ''your guy''! Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it! The whole thing is a joke! B-bani-banishment? You-you're all joking, right? I'm not voting!  Dad, isn't this a little extreme? Hello?  Oh, thank God. Awww! What about me? I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it. Wow, you guys really love animals. I'll live with you. He said I can stay. Ahh, no thanks, that's okay. I ''do'' love animals, just ...not like you guys do. I can't. I was banished for not voting. I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. I guess... I guess you're right.   Aaah!  I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have. Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter! ...What? It's time for what? Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap? Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores.  Butters?  Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town.  Dad?  Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?! Dad, oh my God! What? D-dad, are are you dying? But you-your face! Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore. Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their-  But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at- Dad! Dad, what are you doing?! Dad, you're a geologist! Where are they? Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please. Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave.  Dude, come on! Dude, we have to go! Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman! Goddamn, that took a long time. Where's he? There has to be a way! Why don't you guys just destroy the heart? No, dude, don't!  Save it, Grandpa! Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart. One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department. What?! Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back!  Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad! Come on, Dad! No, dad! We need your keys!  There! The television department! You? We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you. Me. I'm asking the question. Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart? It's a mirror. Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart.  We'd better get out of here.  Dad, come on! We've gotta get out! Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!  ''Right'' now, goddamnit!  Yeah! He just got paroled! What the hell are we gonna do?? Dude, let's play Fireman. Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a ''real'' fire. Then we'll be heroes! Start one. Then we're gonna put it out. Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time. Wow, cool!  We're heroes! Put it out, put it out!  Dude, we are in so much trouble! That's true. No! Yeah, who cares? Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released. Shhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now.   Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection. I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on!  Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders. We've come to... ask you for help. Yeah. What?! Dude, weak!  No! You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class. But mom, my teacher will-  But Mo-o-o- This is hopeless! That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs! No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that ''looks'' like boobs to take a picture of. How do you know?! All right, fine.  Excuse me!  Dude, are we gonna be like that someday? Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge? Dude, what happened? What's that? We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him. No, no, we've just gotta find better help.  There is... one person. Shelly? Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other. Shelly  Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault. We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us! Admit it was our fault? Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you.  See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman." Trent, look, we've realized our mistake!  What is that? Yeah, who cares? Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... ''breast'', if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?  Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet. ...Craig's show?? But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV! Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.  Your idea took about this much thought, Craig!  Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better! Come on, guys!  All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show. Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good. We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders... Good! All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories! Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused. Then, let's do Tolkien's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade. No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want. I knew we could do it! Craig's ''new'' show? Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.  I don't believe it. Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever! Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas? Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh. Crab people?  Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people. We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.  "Warning: Taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects." Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine. I guess we'll just take all of 'em. It's... it's the greatest show of all time. You guys. You guys, wake up!  We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything. You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long. No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!  Even in the girls' bathroom!   We showed the shocking footage to the principal! The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: riddled their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free.   Gee, what a coincidence. Nobody has any ideas? ...Bail.  Oh, thank God. Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman.  It's not gonna work; just come down from there. Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof.   He's not gonna do it. Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!  Butters, Goddammit.  Call an ambulance.  What the hell? It's... nice. Okay, okay.  Woof. Oh, whatta?   What time is it?!  You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow. ...What?  Go away! Shoo!  Again? Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!  Okay, there.    Aw- awww! It's dead. I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore. Wait, wha-what? Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior! But I thought you meant the Son of God! Ugh. Uuugh!  No, no-no-no. Leave me ''alone''!! All right, all right, all right! God!  I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian! No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this! Right, whatever.  Oh yeah. Hello? Anybody in there?  Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil. I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion! Well, you're mountain lions. There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.  What?! No, he didn't. No, he didn't! No, he didn't! Oh, Goddammit!  I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous. This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point. Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born? Too late?! The hell is that?! It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!  I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them! Dude, what the- ?   What?! Kyle?! Dude! No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner. Well, after all that, I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth. Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil. No Santa, don't! The lion cubs! I took them to see how abortions are done.  Yeah. Yeah, there is.  Oh, good. (Shuriken. Awesome!)  (unintelligible) (Yeah, that'd be awesome!) (Yeah.) (Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (I just threw my ninja star at him.) (Butters!) (Butters!) (Me too!)  (Goddamn.) (Yeah, it totally sucked!) (I don't know!) (Yeah!)  (Yeah!) (Malibu? But how?) (Hello.) (Yeah. I agree.)  (Woohoo!) (Woohoo!) Yeah, sure, whatever. Aren't I too big to be Blanket?  All right, but you guys owe me for this. What the hell is going on, you guys? Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket! Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A- (Yeah, totally awesome!) (Giant douche.) (Giant Douche! Vote for him!) (Yeah.) (WHAT??!!!?) (How about we put a ''real'' fire out?)  (I'll do it!) (Oh yeah!)  (Woohoo!) (All right!) (And it's time for us to come clean.)  (Woohoo!) (Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)  (Don't take it personally, Kyle.) Where'd you get those? Uh-uh, they're not ''that'' cool. Aha!  At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead. So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle? You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor!  I am not Craig,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya! Lose who? Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding? Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here! To hell with that! Butters! Butters! Butters! Where the hell are you?!  You guys! It's Butters! We saw 'im! Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly. Butters is right on the other side.  No way.  I believe in Mr. Jefferson! Yeah!   Oh hey guys. Heard about your ''news'' show being cancelled. Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.  This much more than you had! Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me!  Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals.   You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl? I wouldn't if I were you.  Whoa! Where'd you get those?! And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling! Butters! Butters!  Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys? Wow, those animals are pretty cute. Action News! Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive. Huh?  Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute!  That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay. We did that! Cough medicine?  Yeah. It was great. The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Dexa Cough, children's formula. Those wings don't look very strong. There has to be another way! Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not? Let me see. From the nice guy at the county fair. Then fight us! Butters! Butters! But we like being the Cows!  What do you guys want? I haven't decided yet.   I'm still not totally sure. That we can go back to being the South Park Cows!  Yeah, and it was called ''Man from Atlantis'', and he had like, webbed fingers...    I don't know, that looks pretty high up. What happens to the lion cubs? Yeah yeah, come on!  Ho!  Hooray! All right! Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya, my Lord... Hey fellas. What's happenin'? Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you? I think I'd make a really ''good'' ninja.  I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person- Hi Mom.   Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while. Well, o- okay Mom.  Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me! Nuh uh! Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat! Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped! It hurts! It hurts!    Hwaaaaa! You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital!  Whoa, I'm getting woozy.  But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.  Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy. Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.  Wuhuff, woof, woof. bu- but fellas, I gotta-  Hello? Anybody-eh.   Woof woof.  Gaaaah!  Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-  Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it? ...No. No.  No! No no no no!  Waaaaah! Aaaaah!  Aaaaah! Two years ago. Two years ago! Whoops. Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo! What do you want? Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.  Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed? Yeah well, you tell that to their families.   I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died! What?  Aaaah! Get out of my room, Stan. Hey! Can I still dance with you guys? Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again! No! No! Noooooo! What the heck? Whoa! What a huge package!  To Butters Stotch. Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!! Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11. Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package.  Whoa...  You... you're ''my'' robot? Oh wow! Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already. Well I gotta go, Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do. Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have. Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesitated colon, which means I sometimes can't control my sphincter. Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O? Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum. Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff. No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play a trick on me ever again!  Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of ''his'' secrets! When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake. Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it! I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout! Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! ''Then'' I'll have my revenge, boy howdy! Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O? How come? Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you.  <poem>''Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?''</poem> <poem>''My robot friend.''</poem> <poem>''I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.''</poem> <poem>''He's smart as can be and emotion-free''</poem> <poem>''My robot friend.''</poem> <poem>''My robot friend.''</poem> <poem>''My robot... friend.''</poem>  You can carry all my laundry in one trip! Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime. Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he? Yeah! Don't you know nothin' about robots? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away!  Oh. Yeah.  Can you help me? Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' ''you'' do it from now on.  Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there. AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you. Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep. All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? ''If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...'' Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. AWESOM-O?! AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing? Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?! Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better! Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast. Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.   Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.  Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot. Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party.  He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?  He's made in Japan!   Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?! Oh boy,  Hi Aunt Nellie!  It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here! Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in. There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie.  Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.  AWESOM-O? Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go sightseein'! Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?! Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year? Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas? Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.  You, you okay AWESOM-O? Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow. Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor. Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice. Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.

He's my best friend in the whole world! Hey, robots don't fart! Hang on a second, here! It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey! Huh? Hahaha, a turd sandwich!  Ohhh, we lost? Yeah! Yeah, game on, Jew-boy!  A turd sandwich is not only the first ''turd'' to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich.  Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.  Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here.   Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?! Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!   Hey fellas, you'd better be careful. Oh, all right then.  U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me. Hah!  Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad. Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all. Uh... outside? No way!   But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room- Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me! Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while. Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it! Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'. No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through. Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color- Ohhh hamburgers!  Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.  Will do. Boy, that was a ''great'' episode!  Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show. Well, what are we waitin' for?! Hey, yeah. Uh why I could ''say'' I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.  Lie about celebrities. Oh, boy! Sexy Action School News Team, ho!  Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled? Stupid news hair!  Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us? I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies. Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Heh.  Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em. Woo. We aren't havin' a party.  Eww, it's all thick and g-gooey. Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas. Hey! Let's run naked through the street!  Huh?  Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!  Still no celebrities, Eric. Uh, I'll keep my eyes open.  <poem>''Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.''</poem> <poem>''Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!''</poem>  My name's Butters. Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh, even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger." Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.  Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.  I'm sorry.  Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton. Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw.  Oh hamburgers!  Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money?? Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast! <poem>''You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.''</poem>  Well, no, not quite.  Before ''what'' happens?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!     I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear. Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower. Wuh be careful, Kyle. Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean. Well but, but what happened? Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end. Hi Butters. Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again? Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.   Butters?  Oh. Oh, dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy. I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go. Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie. Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot? Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon. Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night? That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot? Aw, that's just adorable. Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are ''really'' getting along great. Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.  Excuse me, I didn't catch that. Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited. Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged, you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie! You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play. Why not? What on earth is the matter with him? I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs.  Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him.  What's that? If only we had let him in!  Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton? You are grounded, mister! Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age. Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us?   With you where? How much? For Butters? Chris, is she serious? We aren't honestly considering this? But he's our son! The rest of the f- you do mean us? Bye, sweetie, we love you! Shut up, Butters! From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn- Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies? Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters! Hey fellas.  Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.  Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events. Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year. S-s-six! S-s-s-ssseven! S-s-seven!  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven reps. Oh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.  Oh he-hey, N-Nathan.  Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training ''really'' hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away. What kind of shortcuts? S-s-ss-s-s-steroids?  ...But aren't those illegal? So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work? How much would this cost me?  Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a performance. Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second!    N-no, Dad. Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy. Oh. Sure thing. Come on in. Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week. Dad, Jesus C-Christ! You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving. I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag? Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.  Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy! Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them! You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you? Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it! Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.  Fuck! Grrrr! Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.  Come on, push it! Push it!   The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.  Oh Jesus!  P-push it! Push it! They-they're all just... jealous.  You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!    Top athlete, yeah! Yeeessss!  Yes! Yes!  Yeah! Yeah!   Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater! What?  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?   Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea. Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second? Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?  And the second?  All right, now we'll see which one ''really'' has staying power. Number one?  Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?  Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.  Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today? Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer. The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents.

Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons? Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out. Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children!  ''[opens up] ''Oh. Hello there, children! Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa. Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay? All right. Now, where did you get served? Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently, they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it. Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'!  No no no! Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen. Stan, what the hell did you dance back for? Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday! Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything?? Oh Lord... All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  This... is the dance troupe? Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do! Oh Lord have mercy.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent. All right, all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer.  Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit. All right! All right! We did it!   My God. Look at all these incredible bargains. Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore. They why don't you just quit?! No, no, no! Let's ''freeze'' it!  We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns!  Hey, Chef.  Hya!  What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?! Can you help him, Doctor?  Right away.  Yes, Doctor.   What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup. I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter. He got served. Worst I've ever seen. We just got the X-rays back. . But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one. From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride. We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure. Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life!  Get a cold towel on that pink belly! Over there!  Another wet willie? Give the poor kid some morphine.  Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl. It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma. There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see.  You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time. It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now. Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days.   I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do. Yes, it was pretty severe. This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours.  Of course. Nurse?   In our last episode the four ninjas did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom. It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons, if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped, and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded. Will those athletes in heat 1 of the hundred-meter dash please report to Track Area B. He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics record, folks!  Winner, Jimmy Valmer!

It just makes me sick how some people can treat animals.  What the? Blasted! He's escaped! ...Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs. Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?  All right, folks, our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp. Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming.  What happened to him? What's the matter with him? You got served? By who? So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back? What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it? No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage! Now!  All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye and give 'em this. Come on, Stan. ...six, seven, eight.  What? So what happened? Uh, hey, ex- excuse me. Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm Stan Marsh's father. Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on. No, no, no, it's not on. It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off. I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye.  Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.  Ungh! Grrgh. Stan? Stan? Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.  You did it, son! You did it! Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon. I heard people saying you all were from Illinois. ....Yeeeah. Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent? Stan, time to get up for school.  Mr. Jefferson?! Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate! Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting.  We know, Stanley. We've been watching. That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour. Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?! They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do. Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is! All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking. Stan Marsh! Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  Hey, Mr. Nelson. Why? This is my office. What? You can't be serious. Oh my God. They took my jarb!! We're doing the only thing we ''can'' do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there ''are'' no future humans! Present-day America Number One! All we can do is try, Harrison. Well what are we waiting for? We're going back to the pile. Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?  You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!  You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?! You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean! You don't understand the issues, Sharon! You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein! Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote! Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended! Expulsion?! Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?!  This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse. Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.  So who won, Mr. Mackey? Stan! He's going to vote! Hey! That's not true, Stan.  Your vote still mattered.  Now your vote didn't matter.  Look at it, honey. It's so big. It's beautiful! Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters.  It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.   I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick. Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  Staaaan?  Staan... No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night. Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park. Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled. Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy ''six'' steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart. I know, I know! God!  Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart! Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart! STAN! ''One'' family buying ''one'' glass isn't gonna make a difference! Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?! I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here. Oh all right, maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips. And butter.  And some new pliers. Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all! Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.  Can I help you?  You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better. I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend. Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine. Shhhhh! What are you talking about? Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God! Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us! Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains!  The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight! I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me! This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff! Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us. You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand? All right, let's not make that mistake again. Oh, no she di'int.  Oh my God! This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down!  Whatwhatwhaaat?! Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them. Sharon, isn't that your father? Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon. All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened.  But let's try to speak one at a time.  Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!  I think if more people saw ''The Passion'' they'd have faith in Jesus. Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?  This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!  Yeah! I agree! Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!  Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten. Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten. Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten. Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.   This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The ''worst thing''! Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?! So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky? Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today. Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous? Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy!  Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night? Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here. We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it. How did you do it, Kyle? Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street!  Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage!  I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this. And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.  We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs! Yeah, they took our jobs! Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?  Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?! What happened to him, Doctor? Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father!  Woo!  You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?! I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards! Aww, yeah. Yeah! Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother. Yeah!  Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in? Yeah! Now it's a Wall-Mart!  Look at that. A bear, mining for coal. Timmy! Timmy!  Timmah. Timmah. Timmah! Timmah! Timmah! Timmah.  Timmah!  Tim- Timmy?   Timmah. Timmah!  T-T-Timmah. Huh! Timmah! T-Timmah! Timmah! Timmah, Jimmih!  Jimmih!  Timmah. Timmah!  Oowrrr! Timmah! Livilaye!  Timmy.  Timmy.  No Timmy, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Timmah! Argh. Jimmy... Uh.  Jimmh Timmah Timmah Jimmih!  Haaaaaaaaaah!  Timmah!  Timmah! Timmih. Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday. Hey Jimmy. So uh, I see you train pretty hard. Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts. You know. Steroids. Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.  twice a day before meals. Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas. Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.  Jimmy? Jim, it's your father! Jimmy, were you masturbating? Okay. Well, you have a visitor.  I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim. I'll leave you two alone.  Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were. Okay, then.  Hi Jimmy. I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow. Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop. I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time. Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different. You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you. You can't treat people like this! Yes, hon?  What's that, hon? Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children. You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea.  ...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No.  Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow. Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please. Eric Cartman... He's nine. ...Um, he's retarded.  Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition? Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting? Oh, that's great, sweetie. Okay, hon. Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately. Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago. Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over. Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Oh, what's wrong with him? Coma... My God, fo- for how long?  Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle! You're doing so much better, muffin. Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again. His new... powers? Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy. Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you. Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives.  Oooh, I'll go make some tea. Oh, goodness! What's going on? O-o-o-o-oh!  Is it over?  All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up! Come on now, keep it tight! Good. Now watch that timing, Gil T! Not bad, kids. Not bad.  All right, it was good. But we don't want "good," we want pain!  Yeah? Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday? Oh, it's on! Whoo, it's on all right!  It's on! Hold on a second, clam-head!  Yeah! You like that?! Wuh-wow, Jimmy, I can't believe how much you've improved! You're bigger and stronger than I've ever seen you! You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday! Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized. Thank you! Good luck, Michael. Okay, next in line please? Hello there. Oh, great! What's his name? Okay. Age? O-kay, and what's his disability? ...N-no, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy? I'll just leave that blank for now. Thank you very much. Paul. Paul! Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy. Yes? Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars? How about fifteen dollars? Oh goodness, what happened? Oooh, no, come on inside.   I can't believe these bargains. Huh, I never.  Thanks.  Of course we know how to dance. Yeah.  The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette. I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it.  We should go to the arcade.  Yeah. There's this Asian kid named Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game.  He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far.  Dude, we need a girl. We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags. Here I am, Blanket! Heeee! Jeh chabee durtah! Blanket! Oh my beautiful Blanket! Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me? Come on, let's climb the tree!  Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree! ''Won't you imagine along with me?'' Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging! Mememe! I'm first! I'm first! Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train! Let's ride the train! The train! Cartman, you have a beautiful voice. ''Let's ride and ride on the train together'' ''On a journey through both of our minds.'' ''[back on the train] Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.'' Kentucky, yeah. No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant. Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals. I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.  D'huh? I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men. Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls. Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'?  ''Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.'' ''Hey!'' Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party! We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared. Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!  What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?  Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party. Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself. Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars.  Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends.  Come on, Blanket! All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!  Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys! Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play! Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket?  Wee, look! He can fly! No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look. Jeekabee durtah!  Ow! There, Blanket, shhhh.  Hey, hey look, hey look. I got your nose.  Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See? No, Blanket, stop! It's ignorant. You're being ignorant! No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again! I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket! But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again! Oh, I'm melting! What are you doing with my Blanket? Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee!   Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!   Wee, he can fly! He can fly! Blanket? Blanket! Come play!   Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh! It's ignorant.  Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting. Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.  I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay? Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it. Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem? Ji-Jimmy? Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?  Mmmmm'kaaay. I don't quite follow, Timmy. Right, Jimmy Valmer. Right. He's Jimmy, yeah. M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich. It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.  Stan's vote bring the total votes for Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And Giant Douche has... one thousand, four hundred, and ten. Giant Douche still wins! What the? They're all dead? Well, that means... Jimmy What the?  Jimmy, oh my God! Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special Olympics!  We will be holding various throughout the day, and at the end of it all we will have some very special celebrity athletes here to present the trophy for top athlete, along with the cash prize of one thousand dollars. So let's have all our athletes report to their first assigned events and... Let the Games begin!  Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end, and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004! Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds.  Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman! For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric! Okay, racers, are we ready?  Take your marks. On your marks! Get set! Go!  Great job, everyone.  All right! Good Job. We did it! The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer. Hey kid. Good for you for being honest. This is an R-rated movie. But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it. Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh? Huh? I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie. That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins! I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers. Yeah. I'd like to see you try. Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love ''The Passion'' to come to this meeting, so here I am! We sure do! Woah! Great idea! Ooo, Aramaic. Cool. Can I help you? They're trying to have ''The Passion'' pulled from the theater. That's... Mel Gibson? Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith. Hac bashtud Christo. Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad. Wa!  Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!!  Hey Terrance, I think I have a- What? Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.  Hey Phillip, guess what? Faaart. Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was. No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise. Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh? I'm not sure, but- uh.  Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie. What was our Aramaic line again? What's going on here? Well, maybe you ''should'' apologize. H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured. You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ. Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on!  Hello. Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by ''The Passion''. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.  Wha- what does that mean, sweetie? Well, what does that mean, dear? Oh, this is fun!  It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.  That's the preschool teacher, Ms. Claridge. Poor woman suffered such horrible burns she can only communicate by... beeping once for yes and twice for no.  Yeah, when a man pees standing up, it's ''normal'', but when a woman does it, it's weird. Kill him! Guilty! Kill him!  Kill him! Kill him! Die! It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use ''The Passion'' to enrich everyone's lives.  Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it?  Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's ''straaange''.  Look, if you're having some kind of problem, you have to be able to talk to people.  Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person! It'll be like a parade! They took your jobs!   Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea. Yeah. All right. Woohoo! Yes? You can't not like ''The Passion''! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home.  Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first.  You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!  You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out! I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!  Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus! How dare you call me crazy! This means war!  Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me.  Freedom!  Jesus is Lord!  ''When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!''  K'plagh! K'plagh! ''And good evening, frieeeeeeends!'' Give me back my money!   Haaaa! K'Plaaaa! Give me my eighteen dollars! Ha!  Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!  I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?! You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?  Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!  Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars! You ''can't'' say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked! Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo!  And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins. ...What is troubling you, my child? Ah! You mean he's a Jew! Yes, ''The Passion'' is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews. Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement. Aaaah! Good idea! What?  Well what about us in the fast-food business?! The restaurants are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less! They took our jobs!  Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congregation.  Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm. This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater! This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped! It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus! Oh my God!  This is bullcrap! Ms. Claridge, the people in town are really worried about you.  All right, fine! But someday you're gonna have to learn to let people in!  Oh no! ''The Passion''?!  They can't do that! Just tell us this: do you trust that we want what's best for you, yes or no?  This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having! That was a good idea! Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes. Hey, that's right! If there is no future, then there'll be no people ''from'' the future to come back and take our jobs!  Took our jobs! Take our jobs! Stereotyping Jews is terrible. Take r jurbs  Huh? Something must be done to stop that movie!  Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten! Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten! Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!  That's right! What he said. Huh? Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games. What the hell? Hey! That's Mel Gibson! Well, what the hell does he want?! You didn't like ''The Passion''? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man.  Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters. You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups. Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are.  That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie! Yeah! Yeah! Remove it from the theater? Fat chance! We demand you stop showing it! Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should all take off all our clothes, scramble into a big pile and start gettin' gay with each other. Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic about it! What? Gettin' gay?  Hey. He's right. If we build for a better future, the immigrants will stay there. How dare you?!  Yeah, how you like that y'all!  Whatchoo got, huh?! You got nothin'! Damn! You just got served! Aww man! Now that kid is gettin' served! Aww man, look at them! They know they can't trip to that!  Yeah! We're outta here!  Come on! They had nothin'! Let's go y'all! You want a little more, homeboys? Wha? Okay. All right. We got served. So now, I guess... It's on. Yeah, bad ass! Oooooo! Oooo man!  Oooo, he is gettin' served!  They're too scared! Looks like they already got served!  Let's bring it to these losers.  They didn't do nothin'! It's the white boys that were served yesterday.   You're not interested? Not interested in this? This Saturday! Our top five dancers against your top five dancers! OC Convention Center. It's on! All right! Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a chance! Ohhh Lord! Looks like they ain't even gonna dance. Aaaah! Aww yeah! He got you, dude. Uh huh.  All right! I heard that! Whoa!  That was smokin'! Well, what we got here? Yeah, that was tight!  We'll see you Saturday, fools!  Dang! Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?! Get out of here! Come on y'all!  Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay? Oh. Stan got served at school today. Let's not make a big deal out of it. That was the right thing to do.  Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here! Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back! It's on!  Randy, oh my God! Oh, are they nice people? Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too. ...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there? Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand? There you go. All set, sweetie? I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  Goodnight, sweetie. Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been? Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner?  What?! Who taught you to talk like that?! That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist. You know, a racist, but against people from the- How was school today, Stanley? ...What did you say? Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?! Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms. It's sexist, is what it is! Are you calling me ignorant?! I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch!  You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.  Oh, Randy! Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?  You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won. Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped. Why yes, I'd love one, Jimmy.  Randy, what are you doing?! It's almost midnight. Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them. We do? Oh Lord, look at those moves. Oooo, they are takin' it out! Oh man, they are getting served! Ooooo, it's getting hot out here! Have mercy! Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin' served! It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on! Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better dancers with you than those loozas! 'Cause, it's on! It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!  Oh Lord it's on! Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce. Boy. You must really wanna take to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan? Man, it is about to get crazy up in here. All right! It's like some mystical evil force. Dance troupe? Please.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.  No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning. I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist. Yeah. We just got Goth-served. Hey, get out of here, you fuckin' dork! Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations. Whoa. I think we just got put in our place. I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all. You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do? That's stupid.  I can't dance without the machine. Okay. I'll give it a shot. Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance. That don't look like a dancing duck to me. What? I don't wanna get served. Can he move it? You did it! Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you? You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls.   Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else. Why not? Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing. I think his name was...  Leopold... Stotch or something? A tragedy? Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.  Stan. Stan, we have a big problem! It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle. He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor. Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy. Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy. Yeah, make some noise! Ladies and Gentlemen, man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim! This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all. So let's give it up for the OC Crew!  And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys! A'ight y'all. It's showtime! All right come on, let's do this! DJ! Give us a hot track!  That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!  One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days]]. other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me]].  It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over. What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson? I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance. I think it's best we try to reason with it. Butters?  Butters, what is wrong with you?? Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now! Butters, play!  Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life. What happened to him, Doctor? Now, honey, we were trying to read.  Hey Nellie, guess what I found scrampin' around the airport.  Butters' new friend is a little strange. He, he really takes playing Robot seriously. I don't think he took the costume off the entire trip. There's my little nephew! How was your flight?  Didn't ya bring any bags? Your robot? Hello! It's nice to have you here. Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot. Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing, or are you guys hungry after such a long flight. Right...  Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right? We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?  Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do. It's not? Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas. Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office? Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O. You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model? Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans? Let me show you what I mean.   We're ''really'' smart.  Oh, very nice, Mitch. Yeah, yeah! Yeah, we wanna hear it! Punch-Drunk Billionaire! What's he do? Mmm, I'd like a piece of that! I'd like to twizel his pixie stick. Yeah, I'd like to wax his crankshaft! I'd like to gargle his marbles.  How was he, Bab? Hey, Mr. Robot, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? Uncle! Uncle!  Uh, excuse me sir, but uh, that's not a robot. No, it clearly had bipedal movement, so the correct term is "computerized automatron." You are the smart one. How can a robot come up with better ideas for movies than us?  Oh, perfect! Give us another movie idea, AWESOM-O! We'll call it "Puppy Love"! Let's hear it! Come on, come on! ... Yes, it's flawless! Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this. The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler.  No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon! Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before ''we'' do... You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  I want that robot! Are those arm and leg locks secure? Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on.  What's going on?  Stand by. Be ready to destroy it. What's happening? What? How can that be? Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist! Who made you, robot? But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?  Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too. Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  What the hell are you doing?! Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!  Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart? Oh, and it, it smells, too! Wow, kid, you're a little faggot! That's incredible! Yes, that might be the best thing to do. Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again. A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't make any sense. You're thinking the robot could be used to come up with anti-Islamic movies? Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice. But worse. With robots.  Jesus, the scientist was right. Hold on a second: If that robot is designed for entertainment, then, turning it into a weapon is unethical. I'm sorry, I must protest. We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability.  What the hell?  It... powered itself back on. Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU. Ah, I'm sorry, robot,  they want me to reprogram you. What did you say?  The robot... It thinks it's alive. It's developed consciousness. Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the... interlaced BV system. Your robot doesn't know it's a robot! Sure, why not? Program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist, and make the robot think he's real! Makes for a lot better movies! I'm not reprogramming a robot that's developed consciousness! Damn you all to hell! Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!  Well I- I'm saving a conscious being! If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!  Let's go! Move, move! Secure, sir! It'll all be over soon, robot! Hello! Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends? I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything. It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket. Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play? We have arcade games inside. Dad? No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games. He's retired now. Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard.  Dad? You out here? Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja- Who wants the first cotton candy?  I fell down. Ow! Thank you. That already feels better. I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now. I don't have a mom. No. I was made in a laboratory. My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home. No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts. Wow, these are great. What are they called again? Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden.  Hi, Stan. Dad says it wants to eat us. We're scared!  Hi guys! Really? You mean it? Aaaaaah!  Aaaaaaaah!   Hi guys! You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Nooo!   Ah! Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy. The Jeffersons? Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit? "Who's Paris Hilton?" She's totally spoiled and snobby.  It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're ''all'' stupid spoiled whores! Yeah, and you get straight A's in school! You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play ''Spin the Bottle'', and ''Two Minutes In The Closet'', and do ketamine. Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is. Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party. I wanna do him. Yeah, they're invited too. Yeah, you said it.   Yeah? Who invited you? Kelly who?  Kelly Rutherford-Menskin? Did you invite him?  Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter? Shut off the light. Paris is gonna rock his world. Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore. Memememememememememe Cuuute.  Super cuuute. Hey Sergeant, take a look at this. Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money. Take a look. Says here...  He's black. Sir? Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.  Wha- wha- what? It says right here on the final sheet he is! It said on the final sheet! Sir, it's possible that he ''is'' black, even though he doesn't look it.  Whatcha got? So, what's the problem? By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe. Let's go people! We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!  Murphy, you inside? Johnson, what about you? Frakes? All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris? Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit? Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride. Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris! It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home. Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy isn't black! Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black! You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!  Does that look like a black guy to you?!  Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who ''wasn't black''! Oh! Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh. Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?  To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I ''know'' he's black for sure! I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force. None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired. And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself.  Think I've got a little more work to do.  Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado. Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson? Well, he doesn't really look that black. You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for? Molestation, nice. That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.  Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!  Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!  Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail. Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore. All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?  Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma? I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities. I know it's ridiculous,  Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you? Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now? Little boy...  we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.  Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others. Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind? Jesus Christ! Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop! Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you? Get him!  Code 6! Code 6! Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.  His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good. There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric!  We've got a little problem. While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed. Which can only mean one thing! That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away! Jesus Christ! Cause of death? So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!  Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!  Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him. Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder? What do you think, Mitch? All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use. You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use? Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint.  Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr... Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation.  I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too. Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy!  Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong. This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands. Well those aren't left hands.  See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands. Nope, this isn't our man.   Yeah... Amazing coincidence... Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right.  Wait a minute. I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests.   Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?  Oh my God. Murphy!  You're not gonna believe this. Hold it right there, killer!  Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail. It must be true. The kid is psychic.  Hee hee!  Sutah!  Dugh! Heehee! Ja-! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch! I'm planting the cocaine now. We'd better get back to the station, sir. What is it, Lou? Aw, come on, sir. Jesus, how did he...? The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy.  Sir? We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.  All right, here's a hundred dollars. This body also had a missing hand ''and'' a bowl of corn flakes next to it! We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again. Quiet! He's havin' a vision!  Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, bus driver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much. Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing. I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman.  ...Sir? ...Restraint? Sarge! In here!  Sir? Right. Ohhh.  Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.  Heh- sir? Sarge...  What is it? Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer? You're certainly a better psychic then Eric. Do you think that's true?  Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir. Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry. Quitting the force? You?  Where're you goin'? Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl. Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you? Hm. No, we never had any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves. Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial. We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges. Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarrassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm! Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure. Haaaaa! Haaaaa! This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown.   Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car. Christina Naylon has more. Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad? Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work? And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison? If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time. Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris? Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America. Breaking news at the time border. We go now live to Harrison Moore.  The news ''is'' incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?  Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Uh, he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh, to find a job here. Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi- his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundreds of dollars, but uh, enough, he says, to feed his family.  Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow ''Terminator'' rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to ''Back To The Future'' rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, ''Timerider'' rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay. Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived!  It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for ''his'' family. Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish? Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?  Young man, what do you think about all this? Yes? Ooh, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it. One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.  Back to you, Aaron.  Thanks for having me, Bill. You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans!  They took our jobs! Those jobs belong to people from the present!  They took our jobs!! Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman.  "Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane." So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening! All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening?  How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?! Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like? Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs! Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs! Hey, yeah. Well that's not a bad idea! Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs! You ''have'' to, Jimbo, or else we won't be able to stop them! They took 'r jaobs!   Everyone who believes in America, join in with us! We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent! Yeah America!  The immigrants are fadin' away! Back in the pile everyone!  They took your jobs!  They took yer jobs! Welcome, welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right? And what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future. All right? Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it. All right? But others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off. All right? Now, I've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter. On my right is pissed-off, white-trash, redneck conservative. And on my left is aging, hippie, liberal douche. Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal, all right? All right. What say you, aging hippie liberal douche? All right, redneck, your rebuttal? Hello. Heh, it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away? They took our jobs! They took our jobs!  Too-kourderb!! All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak. So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs. Remember that there are transitive verbs such as  "The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late." Or in Futurespeak, "Vvut." Thank you, aging, hippie, liberal douche. Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this?  "The sad girl puts balls in her mouth." Or, in Futurespeak of course, "Gluch gligh balls glych gligh." Oh, Jesus, not PETA again. All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we ''are'' going to change our school mascot. That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win.  Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot.  Ge-get outta here, PETA! We're changin' the mascot already!  Go on, get outta here. Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians... No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people. Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche.  And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich.  Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.  Hey everybody, it's time!  It's time! Get down to Metzger's Field! It's about to happen!   Well what are you doing here, Randy? Let's burn it down!  Yeah, lets all shop over at True Value! Oh, looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight. Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that for your bad coughs, right?  Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right? F-from from me? Well sure, come on in. Mr. Slave is right over here.  Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you. ...Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa. Give him time, Wendy. Give him time.  Come on, Mr. Slave. Now, that's a whore!  "Vvut."  Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture. Who are we to say our language is best? They deserve to have an education just as much as you do. You betcha.   Trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant. Those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness. What? That's ridiculous! How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and it ushers in a new ice age? Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'? Well I was just tryin' to be helpful. Did you say "get gay"?  They took our jobs! Gaur da'ka? Uh oh... Can I help... you?  Chicken sandwich?  A cheeg- fry? A cheeg- fry? Can I help you?  Chicken sandwich? People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart!  I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change...   Fools. Ignorant fools. Come in?  Oh hello, fine shoppers.  What? What, you think ''I'' want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave. Oh, you're wrong!  Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're ''working'' at the Wall-Mart because ''it'' has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.  Not so loud! It can hear you. Aah!  I ain't turnin' queer. You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh- Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here. Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooh, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced. Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk. I'm... sorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some time to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room.  Gheglo. Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow. Jump in! Come on, everybody! Never mind, we're going back to the pile! Took yer jurb! <poem><i>We are South Park, Green and White. Let's go, Cows! Fight, fight, fight! Nobody can beat a Cow! Let's gooo, South Park!</i></poem>   Moooooooo! Ewww!  I think us Cows have the ''best'' school spirit. Huh, Mandy? Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going!   Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you! Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it! Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall! Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here! Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls.  Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous! Thanks, Annie!  You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party. You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity! Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost! Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited.  Party at my house tonight, Kyle. Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue! Hey Kevin, party at my house. We're being stupid spoiled whores.  What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?! Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule! Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for. Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all. Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.  Yeah, and South Park is ''really'' gonna stick it to Littleton next week!  We are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals! We protest your insensitive use of cows as your school mascot!  This is the fate of the cow! This is your insensitivity!  The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity! To be thrown away by a society gone wrong! Awwwwwwww! You're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions! Who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves?! But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive? We're gonna miss what? Who's Paris Hilton? I don't get it. What's she do? ...But what does she ''do''?  What does she do?! You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton? But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender! Hey, Jessie , Hey, Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange. Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum? What?! Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society. It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon. I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.  Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong! Dad! Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight. I'm a stupid spoiled whore.  That's okay. Yes. No, I need help. Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend. No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know. Can you teach me your secret fast? Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.  What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there. That's okay, you guys.   ...Wait, wait, what about Butters? Go, giant douche! Hey, South Park! Have we got school spirit?!  Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming. But I would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent. He is a turd sandwich ... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, ''you'' are in fact, the turd sandwich. ... Sir, ''you'' are a turd sandwich. Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, I-I forgot what I was saying. We've got spirit, yes we do! We are sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh!   You're a turd sandwich.  You're a turd sandwich.  You're a turd sandwich. I-I'm sorry, Jim. Ha. What a douche.   Oh, you stupid turd! Shut up, turd! I'm watching television! I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!  Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you? Oh, you are such stupid turds. Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job. Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return. Shut up, turd!  You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did! You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd.  Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting. Apparently, you haven't heard of my "Vote or Die" campaign.   What you ''think'' it means, bitch! <poem><i>Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye..</i></poem> <poem><i>Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you.Yeah.</i></poem> <poem><i>You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!</i></poem> <poem><i>'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice </i></poem> <poem><i>Vote or die!

We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed. No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible. No. Banishment. You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return. Oh my goodness! Well I... we... Yo, Puffy man, are we just gonna let this happen?  We've gots to kill this non-votin' fool! Look! What is that? Just sit still for a moment. Get offa him, you filthy human!  You're safe now. We will give you food and shelter. Open the gate!  The... kid wants to stay, too. Oh, the poor thing! Don't worry, we'll free you. Poor thing needs water. Shame on you, making this horse your slave.  Come, you can live with us. This poor creature is in need of food and water.  You have a home here, friend. I don't know if ''you'' can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.   Yes, life here is good and natural. But now that you know where our compound is, you'll either have to live with us, or be murdered.  It's not up to you. You'll have to talk with Dr. Cornwallis.  What did he say? Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond his year. Here's your PETA shirt and a bumper sticker.  Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa.  And she's ovulating. Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals. You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home. But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote? But Stan, don't you know? It's ''always'' between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics.  Kill me... Kill me! Kill meee!!  Welcome to the cable-access televised debate between a giant douche  We'll start with Giant Douche. Sir, some students and parents are reluctant to have a... giant douche represent them. What do you say to those people? Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I ''will'' ask you not to speak out of turn. All right, Turd Sandwich, this next question is for you. How should South Park Elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events. Your time is up, Turd.  I... hope that teaches you a lesson about wearing fur. Vote or die!  Yeah! All right! Aawwww!  Welcome to Wall-Mart. Welcome to Wall-Mart. ...Welcome to Wall-Mart. Welcome to Wall-Mart. Six ninety-nine, fifteen dollars, free for fifteen ninety-eight... Thanks for coming to Wall-Mart.  Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business. I can't compete with Wall-Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can't make ends meet.  I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work. I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll have to try somewhere else in town.  Can I help you? Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it. In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators. We... invented the Wall-Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low.  We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control.  You don't stop it. There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall-Mart in your town! ...Unless... of course, you can find and destroy its heart. Every Wall-Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process! Because the Wall-Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all.  Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far.  I am... Wall-Mart.  I've taken this form in order to talk to you. But I can take many forms.  To find the heart of Wall-Mart, one must first ask oneself, "Who is it that asked the question?"  Ah, yes, but who are you? Ah. You know the answer, but not the question! Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall-Mart? It lies beyond that plasma-screen television.  Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take many forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire! Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?!  Now you see me as I truly am! ''...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.'' Let's go! Yeah!  Ohhh!  Say Uncle!  Say Uncle!!!!!!  What do ''you'' shitheads want?! Sure! I burn lots stuff. Do you dickheads even know how to put out a fire? All right, fine.   Put it out! They said they could put it out! Tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.  Butters, you saw! Tell them what happened! You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall! You'd better ''all'' pray!  I gots some business to take care of.   Five years. It's been five long, miserable years. Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?! I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start. Four seconds! Three seconds! Can Kyle come out and play? Thank you, ma'am.   Five years I've been waitin' for this day. You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison ''you've'' been enjoying nice, normal lives! Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBRA STREISAND!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANISTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!!  Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with. You don't even know how to use that!  No! They did it!    Trent Boyett, what have you done now?! Children, get back away, now!  I'M BUUURNIIIING!!! Come on, hurry! We've gotta get her to the hospital!  You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was ''your'' idea. I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!  All right, yeah, woohoo, we did it! Hello, Ms. Claridge.  Yeah, woohoo! All right! Woohoo! Awesome!   Cuuute. Super cuuute.  I'm gonna jump the wall of fire.  Yeah, that was sweet! Omigod!  I'm taking them to the bushes! Hey, look!  Stupid little Fourthies!  What are you little Fourthies doin' in ''our'' hangout?! Help?!  Yeah? And what do ''we'' get for it?  You're gonna have to do better than ''that'', Fourthies! You're Stan Marsh, right? We want a picture of your mom's boobs!  Come back with a naked picture of your mom! Then we aren't helpin' you! It'd have to be a good picture, too!  So long, Fourthies! What do you want now?!  Whoa! I knew she had a hot rack!  Oh all right, we'll let this Trent Boyett know that if he messes with you, he's messin' with us!  We... told him not to mess with you guys... We told him... you paid us. OOOOOoooOoOooo!  Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Boobs! Your mom has the sweetest ''bewbs'' ever.  These are like the hottest tits I've ever seen! I get to take the picture behind the bushes after you. Hey, hold on a second! ''Bewbs''! I'm taking them to the bushes first! Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's tits. Oh yeah, those are so hot.  Oooohhh You got a picture of your mom's ''bewbs''? Check them out! No way! Whoa! I need three minutes alone with the picture behind the bushes. Doctor, we have another snuggie here! Worst one yet. Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time.  Yep, meatloaf again.  It's all slimy and spitty!  So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh? Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this to you?  Yes, yes. Take him away! He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.  Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show. Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week. Four.  Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57! Oh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens.  It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than your show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh-sorry, kids.  Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens! I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay.  Boys, first of all, I want to tell you how impressed I am with your ability to get more ratings. Your show beat ''Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens'' by three viewers! Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed in the ratings by Craig's new show.  All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called ''Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats''. Take a look.  That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He's like... an idea machine. I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys. I'm gonna have to give you all F's in Extracurricular AV Class. You have to learn now how important ratings are! Yes.  Boys, I want to congratulate you on what is perhaps the finest piece of student television I've ever seen. Not only did you get all the students and myself off of couch medicine, but you got a 22 in the ratings! Oh yes, Craig. It appears that the ratings for your show are down significantly. You need to know how important ratings are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically.  You boys are approved for twenty-seven new shows. I want you to come up with an even better idea than the cough medicine story. Get to it!   Yeah! Hey look, it's Craig! Hey, Craig, over here! Woohoo! Woowhoowoo! Can I help you boys? Whoa, boys! That's not what you need to come up with ideas. No! What you want is Calminex PM.  It has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses. Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy kind of high you're looking for, I do also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu. Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin Cough and Cold, but of course, that's only if you ''really'' want to trip balls. That's the spirit! All right, boys, I'll just need your parents' permission.  Oh, Jesus Christ  Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ! Oh, Hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework? Thank you sweetie. Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember.  Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things. As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough. So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway? A what?! For God's sake, where?! Oh Jesus!  Kids, kids! Girls, what on earth are you doing? Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!  Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife! Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing. Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life. Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay? Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.  People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore.  ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people. You don't know? She's super-rich!  Oh yeah, let's get lots of that! Wow, you really sound like a dumb brat, Bebe. Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff! Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is? See? You ''are'' too smart. Oh, yeah. Here comes Kyle.  Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way.  Be at Bebe's house, tonight, at seven!  Ew, party foul! Wow, what a bitch.     I can't wait to get out of here! Grody! They have the lamest stores, too.  I flashed all these hicks on my boobs; you should've seen the look on their faces! Stupid redneck idiots!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Another dog killed itself! Bwaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaa!  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Woooooooooohooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo...  Look at how cuuute. I want that! I want ''that''! It's adorable!  Look at his ''wittle'' puff ball!  Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car.  I want to find a bear costume for him. Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear? I want it! I want it! ''I want it''!  Well, did they say anything about limousines?   Get in the limo, Mr. Biggles! We're gonna have a bear costume made for you!  With schnapps and Scotch.  I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me. To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much? I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it.  I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it!  I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now. What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much.   Eugh. Where am I? Ew! This room's all middle-class and small! Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever! Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my ''new'' pet ''before'' anything happens.    Mr. Biggles! Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?! What isn't great about it? What's more to life than partying? You don't even know what partying is, loser.  Oh I went there. I went there, took some pictures, and flew back already. Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!   Oh my God, it's so gross! Let me out of here!  What the fuck is that? What? Oh dear... All right, Ms. Hilton, we'll find you another dog. There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we? Paris, I believe this is somebody's child. I don't think you can actually- All right, all right, come on- come on, young man. Sure, Wendy. We were just trying to think of something to do. Nah, that sounds really dull. Yeah!  You're a Stupid Spoiled Whore.  Where are you goin', Wendy? Hey, I know! Let's make a videotape of us having sex with boys!  I just got  You can make videos that get out on the Internet! I'm pretending to be calling my friends on the cellphone while my man waits for more sex! <poem>''Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset!''</poem> <poem>''Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Show the whole world what a slut you are!''</poem> <poem>''Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Let everyone see your coo-ooch!''</poem> ''Hold steady, Santa.'' Butters, never get into a car with a stranger. Unless it's a limousine. Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear? Your girlfriend?  Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money? Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son!  So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels. Butters is our son. He's not for sale. Excuse me?! Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk. Butters, right now! Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents ''not'' to consider it. I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family. Yes, us, the rest of the family. Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton. Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars.  It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front. All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay. It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!  Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal? Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her. Oh that trouble making son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister! So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy! You're a grounded old bear. Hi, sweetie. What's the matter? Oh? ...Gosh. Well, get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch ''The Price is Right''?   What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady! Oh my God! Well, this place is-! Oh my God!  Mrs. Faulk, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?! Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?!  But these are our girls!  Oh, uh, sure I can buy a purse. Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard.  Oh yeah. I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on, you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!  It's what's in right now. I, I can't have my little girl be the only one not in a trend; she'll be unpopular. I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's ''normal'', but if a woman wants to be one, it's wrong.  Yeah! Right! Yeah! Right! It isn't fair! Hooray! All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts from now on, so you can just get used to it.  Yeah. Will you buy me that purse I want over there? I'll do anything, 'cause I'm a whore. Yeah.  Ooooo! Ooooo! Oooo, look, here comes Clyde. Mmm, talk to me, kosher boy.  Jason has a huge bulge. You're gonna get it, boys. Look, here comes Kevin.  See you there, Kev.   We had a great time, didn't we Clyde?  Yeah? No!   Mommy, I think I have a fever. Can you take my temperature?   Oooooooooooh! Oooooooooooh! Jesus Christ! Hey yeah, tackle the queer kid!  We'll show you, queer!  Whore-off! Whore-off! Ah, testing? Hello?  Ah, I'm... not quite sure how we... start this competition off, but uh- The homosexual is right. From now on, Bebe, you're going to dress like a little girl.  Paris, you must find the way out of this place or you'll surely die. Make your way to the small intestine. There you will meet the Sparrow Prince, who can guide you to Catatafish. Now go, Paris Hilton. Make haste!  All right, make sure you get pictures of everything in this crime scene.  Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours. Who's the kid? Aw, Christ! Yes? Oh, hello, detectives. Sure, come on in!  I'm afraid the house is a little bit of a disaster area since I have- Why?! Why?!  Yes, thank you very much, Kyle. Use the taser! Use the taser!  He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him! Do it again!  Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town, where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene.  Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything? I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law!  How do you know?! Are you psychic?! Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but ''dammit'' she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again!  Maybe his powers have left him. Yeah.  You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness. Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds. You are obviously a big fan of my work. But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched! And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim. Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation!  Do you see? Do you see?! Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio.  This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?! Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park!  Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?! God. That's it, no more pictures.  Time to die. Your hand will be one with the others.  The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help. Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying.  who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence. So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?! You ''must'' pay the twenty five dollar fee ''and'' give us ten percent of your earnings! Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger? All right, everyone!  Enough!  We are ...obviously quite evenly matched. I guess this will have to be settled in court. We brought a class-action lawsuit against you! We'll see you before the judge tomorrow!  Yes, thanks.  Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle. Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like ''we'' all did. Well you just can't ''say'' you're a psychic detective, you have to use the ad in the comic book! Yeah! You were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the Psychic Detective School.  Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He says another little boy just awoke from a coma, and is having psychic visions! Then let this be our final battle!  ...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day. The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile... The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said... Said the little boy in the red poofball hat. He knew that only by going to the forest could he -- Yes, he did. Yes, he did. Said the boy in the red poofball hat! "We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!" The abortion doctor inquired. The little boy quickly begun, And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later.  Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest. What are we gonna do? Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh? Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw. I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew. Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil! How do you like our Christmas tree? Porcupiney is pregnant! How delightful!  I'm not c-c-comin' out. And you got rid of her. Gee, he looks sad.  Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host. Death and pain await all living things. Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest!  How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while? Goo- goodbye Stanny!  Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born. Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead. Are you sure? You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!  We figured you'd be perfect! To stop us? How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve. You've got to come with us! Gosh, we did it! Oh. Hiya, Stanny! Wow, look, there's Santy Claus! Oh no, I see a problem. Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star! I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization. So soon! I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord. I deduce it is. Stanny, you're alive. The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ. What is it, Mousey? Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate. For real and for true? Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine? Yeah. We've got a big problem. Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all. You're perfect! Just pu-perfect! Awww.  Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?  Yay! Ohhhh! Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat! Hi, Stanny! Awwww. (Cheers) The mountain lion! Hide!  Awwww!  Awwww. Stanny!  Hail Satan! Yaaay!!  Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay! Yay! Awwwww. Yay! Hi there!  Yay!   Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo! Let's go! All right! Woohoo!  Yay! Aaaaah!  We can't have a tree with no star on it. It's the nicest star I ever saw. But we got to have a manger. You all right, Lady Porcupiney? But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion? But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist. But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya. Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick! Oh look. That little feller is all alone. But does that mean you aren't baptized? Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you-  Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star. You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!  There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in. This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever! Is it gone? Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord. Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny! He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan! Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.  Blood orgy!  Hail Satan. The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into. Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human. Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.  Hail Satan. The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest.  She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior. Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again. Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole. This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh! It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day. My son will have the nicest bed in all the forest. Oh dear, I'm so very afraid. Christmas is saved!   Oooo. Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all. Our souls are saved! Fit for a king! Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time! Finally the critters are gonna have a Savior of their very own, of their very own!   No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay! Drink his blood! Drink his blood! That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world! Will you really, Stanny? Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day! Does this mean we can go to sleep now? Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion! Aww, but why? Let's eat his flesh!  We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny. Mommy? Mommy!  W... wake up, Mommy, wake up! He's come to kill us now! You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister? And our baby claws. But, we don't know how to give abortions. Don't leave us, Mommy.  Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why? It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways. Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth. Yeah. An abortion. That can work. Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy! Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around. Yeah, and you killed her. And a dead mom. What? You mean like in an abortion? Do you know some place we can learn, mister? Sure. We know how to give abortions now. Yes... he...  did!  Excuse me, what are you doing here?! If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!  All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?! Little boy, you should be ashamed! Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters!  Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into. Don't do it, Kyle!   We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul. What? Well little boy, it seems that ''you''  have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year? But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist?  Wha -- Oh my, what happened?  Mommy? Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!
