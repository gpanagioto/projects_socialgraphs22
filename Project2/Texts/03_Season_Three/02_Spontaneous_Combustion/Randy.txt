...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist. Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth. Wow. Or else what?  Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no. Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else. Exactly. Right. It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing? New girlfriend? Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.  What?! All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Do you feel hot? Damn it! How come you're not combusting?  No! Has she been doing anything odd? Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend. No! I think I might have it.  Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust. Wow.   The methane gathers here in the bowel area  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long. Exactly.  I am? I ''am'', huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!  You wanted to see me, Mayor? I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave. Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems. Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent. Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly.  Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up? Stan? Awww crap. Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.  Hey! Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.  Mr. Garrison, help me! I-I don't know what to say. Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me. Hm. Really? Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me. What? You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book. All right. Now, let's get to work. Wow!  ...Right, right right. Uh. Please, everyone-   Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer. It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny. I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.
