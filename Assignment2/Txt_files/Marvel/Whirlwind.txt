'''David Cannon''' was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. After discovering his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power to move at great speeds at an early age, he turns to a life of crime.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Whirlwind is then employed by master villain [[Count Nefaria]] and joined the [[Lethal Legion]]. Nefaria temporarily amplifies the abilities of Whirlwind and super-powered team-mates [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and the [[Living Laser]] before sending them against the Avengers.

Whirlwind later attacks Hank blaming for Janet's death during the "[[Secret Invasion]]" and outraged by Pym taking the Wasp codename. He is defeated by the [[Avengers Academy]] student [[Striker (comics)|Striker]]. In a conversation between Striker and his mother, it is revealed that she hired Whirlwind to stage the attack to gain publicity for Striker.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Whirlwind was recruited by the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and [[Zeke Stane]] into joining the other villains in a plot to take down [[Iron Man]]. Whirlwind receives a new costume from Mandarin and Zeke Stane.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #513. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Whirlwind was hired by [[Power Broker (character)|Power Broker]]'s "Hench" App to kill Ant-Man as part of the App's demonstration to [[Darren Cross]]. When Cross was unwilling to give Power Broker the 1.2 billion dollars he demanded for investment in the Hench app, this caused Power Broker to cancel the demo and cancel Whirlwind's assassination on Ant-Man.<ref>''The Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Whirlwind was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.

In a lead-up to the "Sins Rising" arc, a wheelchair-bound Count Nefaria later forms his latest incarnation of the Lethal Legion with Grey Gargoyle, Living Laser, and Whirlwind in a plot to target the Catalyst.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> At Empire State University, Dr. Curt Connors reveals the Catalyst to the crowd when the Lethal Legion attacks. While Grey Gargoyle and Whirlwind attack the people present, Living Laser helps Count Nefaria to operate the Catalyst. Spider-Man shows up and has a hard time fighting them due to the fact that his mind was focused on what a revived [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] did to [[Overdrive (character)|Overdrive]]. Sin-Eater shows up and starts using the same gun he used on Overdrive on the Lethal Legion members while taking their powers. All four of them were sent to Ravencroft where they started to act like model inmates. It was mentioned that Whirlwind was attacked by the inmates that he knew.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As a side-effect of Sin-Eater's suicide upon copying [[Julia Carpenter|Madame Web]]'s precognition revealed that [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|Kindred]] was using them, Whirlwind and the rest of the Lethal Legion regained their sins and are among the villains that went on a rampage.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #56.

==Powers and abilities==
Whirlwind is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to rotate his body around its lengthwise axis at great speeds, without impairing his ability to see, speak, or interact with his environment (for instance, pick up objects or change clothes). Although he can rotate at subsonic speeds he can only travel in a straight line for a limited time, or fly like a helicopter for an even shorter length of time. He possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, coordination, and balance, and often uses himself as a human battering ram. Whirlwind has the ability to focus air currents generated by his rotation into a jet stream powerful enough to blast a hole through a brick wall, as well as create a windscreen able to deflect matter as massive as a falling boulder. He also has the ability to create small tornadoes.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Whirlwind wears full body armor. Since upgrading his armor, Whirlwind has added to his offensive capabilities via the use of two {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hardened tool-steel sawblades mounted on metal wrist bracelets, which are driven by two DC servo-motors each and activated by palm switches. He also uses thrown [[shuriken]] and razor sharp jacks, whose damaging potential is greatly increased by the velocity of his whirling powers.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
In the ''[[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]'' reality, Whirlwind is featured as well. This version wears a streamlined suit of armor with multiple blades.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Masters of Evil'' (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> He was hired by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to attack Tony Stark. To this end, Whirlwind kidnapped Stark's secretary [[Pepper Potts]] and blackmailed Stark to come to the Stark International office on Long Island alone without his "bodyguard" Iron Man (unaware that Stark himself was in reality Iron Man). Going to the office without his Iron Man armor, Tony was more than ready to deal with Whirlwind without his armor. Using various gadgets to defend himself and Pepper, Stark had Whirlwind chase him down to a Stark International Lab. There Tony activated a Kinetic Intake Converter that threatened to destroy Whirlwind if he didn't surrender. Refusing to do so, Whirlwind was engulfed with the converter's energy and killed.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===JLA/Avengers===
Whirlwind is among the enthralled villains guarding [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold. He tries to attack Thor from behind as Thor helps [[Red Tornado]] but is shot by [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Old Man Logan===
In the pages of ''[[Old Man Logan]]'', the elderly Logan awoke on Earth-616 and had a flashback to where Whirlwind, [[Red Skull]], [[Baron Blood]], [[Count Nefaria]], and [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] were standing over the dead bodies of the superheroes the day when the villains rose and the heroes fell.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #1.
