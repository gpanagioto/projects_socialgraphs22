The origin of this Thermite has not been revealed before joining the [[New Enforcers]].

When [[Richard Fisk|Blood Rose]] tracked the New Enforcers to their headquarters, Thermite assisted his teammates into attacking Black Rose where he uses his powers to disarm Blood Rose. [[Spider-Man]] arrived in his new armor and defeated the New Enforcers members until Thermite was the only one left standing. Thermite managed to destroy Spider-Man's armor, but Spider-Man managed to knock him out with one punch. Thermite and the other members of the New Enforcers were arrested by the police.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #100</ref>
