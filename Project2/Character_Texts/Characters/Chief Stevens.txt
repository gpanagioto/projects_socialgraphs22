We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage. Yes, ma'am.  Come out with your hands up!  All right, Manson, this is it! We're coming in after you! There's gonna be a lot of bloodshed, and a lot of innocent people are gonna die! You've got until 100-Marshmallow to come out! Look out, he's got a white flag!   They're surrendering!  You're going back to prison to rot, Manson! What?? Stop that.  Happy Holidays, Bob. Come on, Manson. You belong in jail.
