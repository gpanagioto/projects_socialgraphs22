==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Flash 133.jpg|125px|left|thumb|''The Flash'' #133 (December 1962), cover art by [[Carmine Infantino]]]]
'''Citizen Abra''' is from the 64th century, at a time when science has made [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] obsolete. However, he desires a career as a performing magician, so he goes back in time to find an audience to entertain after stealing a time machine and inventing a device to paralyze the guards, and soon clashes with the Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]).<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff  |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains  |publisher =Facts on File  |date =1987  |location =New York  |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=1}}</ref> He has a hypnotic device that makes people clap regardless of their thoughts, which he uses to force applause from audiences even when they don't applaud his magic tricks. He finds his magic is being overlooked, so decides to involve himself in important events. When the Flash tries to stop a crime he is committing, he makes the Flash clap, enabling him to escape. He is able to send the Flash into space after challenging him to a fight at the theatre, but the Flash is able to change the course of the planetoid he is on so he is sent back to Earth, and finds Kadabra took his left-behind costume, meaning he can follow the impulses, and Kadabra is jailed. But he hypnotizes the Governor using a ray from a device made out of pots and pans, to let him out, and starts staging a puppet show where the Flash is defeated by a puppet called Captain Cream-Puff. When the Flash passes a poster advertising Kadabra, he is turned into a puppet and used in the performance. But the Scarlet Speedster is able to restore himself slightly using the organic matter in his brain, which was not transformed, and then reverse Kadabra's ray so he is restored completely. He again defeats Kadabra.<ref>''The Flash'' #133 (December 1962)</ref>

In one of his many confrontations with the Flash, Abra Kadabra's technology is damaged and his body becomes insubstantial and wraith-like.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 2 #23 (February 1989)</ref><ref>''The Flash'' vol. 2 #67 (September 1992)</ref> After his body is returned to normal, he is captured by a bounty hunter named Peregrine, and returned to his native century to serve a death sentence, although he is saved by the Flash before he can be executed.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 2 #68 (September 1992)</ref> Shortly after returning to the 21st century, during the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, he forgoes his technological implements and tricks five [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] into selling their souls to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] so he can gain genuine magical powers.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Abra Kadabra later kidnapped [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], the girlfriend of [[Wally West]] (Barry Allen's protégé and successor), during their wedding and erases her from history,<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 2 #142 (October 1998)</ref> though he is ultimately defeated with the help of [[Dark Flash|Walter West]], Wally's counterpart from an alternate dimension.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 2 #158 (March 2000)</ref>

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Abra Kadabra became a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #2 (January 2006)</ref>

In "[[One Year Later]]", he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash ([[Bart Allen]]).<ref>''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #11 (June 2007)</ref> Though Inertia is defeated, Kadabra and the other Rogues successfully beat Bart to death, though not before Kadabra recognizes that Bart is too young to be the Flash they are used to dealing with.<ref>''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #13 (August 2007)</ref>

=== ''Salvation Run'' ===
Abra Kadabra is one of the exiled villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', along with his fellow Rogues: [[Captain Cold]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Weather Wizard]], and [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]]. Upon coming across the planet's local pygmies, Abra Kadabra deciphers their language and uses it to locate a "safe zone" for himself and the other Rogues before leading the other villains dispatched there to it.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #1 (January 2008)</ref>

He was a member of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] who joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains;<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 2 #21 (July 2008)</ref> however, the rest of the Rogues left the Society.<ref>''Rogues Revenge'' #1 (September 2008)</ref>

He was last seen in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' off-panel, being attacked by [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash]]. In the final issue of the miniseries, Abra is seen to have survived Zoom's attack and says Zoom should have made sure he was dead.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (April 2010)</ref>

=== ''DC Rebirth'' ===
Abra Kadabra makes his Post-''[[DC Rebirth]]'' debut in the ''[[Teen Titans (comics)|Titans]]'' series. He first appears as a bumbling and terrible party magician known as Mister Hocus Pocus. When [[Lilith Clay|Lilith]] forms a psionic link with Wally West to try and uncover who or what removed 10 years of history from everyone's memories, she accidentally awakens Abra Kadabra from within Mister Hocus Pocus. Abra Kadabra reveals he is the one who made Wally disappear and he will now destroy him.<ref>''Titans'' vol. 3 #1 (2016)</ref>

Abra Kadabra creates younger puppet duplicates of the Titans and has them fight the Titans. When the puppet Lilith finds [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] and tells Abra Kadabra of her importance to Wally, Abra Kadabra realizes that history is broken, knowing that Wally and Linda will not meet years from now. Abra Kadabra realizes that his plans must be sped up, and before he can contemplate this any further, he is attacked by [[Garth (comics)|Garth]]. Abra tries to kill him, but only succeeds in injuring Garth due to Wally's interference.<ref>''Titans'' vol. 3 #2 (2016)</ref> Abra Kadabra reveals to Wally that he removed the latter from time and recollection because he always managed to thwart Abra Kadabra's plans, and disappears with his puppet Titans afterwards. At the theater, Abra Kadabra tries to receive evaluations of the Titans from his puppets. Abra Kadabra reveals his origin (which is similar to his Pre-''Flashpoint'' origin) to his puppets, revealing that he is from the future and traveled back in time in order to become famous, but his plans were always thwarted by the Flash (Barry Allen) and Kid Flash (Wally West). Abra Kadabra then used almost all of his power to throw Wally into the time stream in order to remove him from time, but it removed his memories in the process. Intrigued as to why history has been knocked askew, due to the fact Wally knows Linda (even hinting that he knows the true perpetrator), Abra Kadabra begins to craft an even greater trick and he kidnaps Linda from in front of Wally.<ref>''Titans'' vol. 3 #3 (2016)</ref>

He then attempts to force Wally into a position where Wally will run himself into the Speed Force, believing that Wally will be unable to return without Linda as his 'lightning rod',<ref>''Titans'' vol. 3 #5 (2016)</ref> but Wally is able to return by using the Titans as his own lightning rod after talking with a representation of his memories of Linda in the Speed Force, which assures him that he can still win Linda back. With Abra Kadabra defeated and sending him into the time stream, Lilith notes that she cannot understand Abra Kadabra's madness, but picked up a key word in his thoughts as "[[Doctor Manhattan|Manhattan]]".<ref>''Titans'' vol. 3 #6 (2016)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Abra Kadabra is a powerful sorcerer and can achieve virtually any feat with his spells. Originally his powers were all due to 64th century scientific technology that appeared magical to residents of the 20th century. Later, Kadabra's powers are augmented to include true [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] when he strikes a deal with Neron.<ref>''Underworld Unleashed'' #1 (November 1995)</ref>

==Other versions==
===''New Rogues''===
The [[New Rogues]] version of Abra Kadabra is '''Mr. Magic''', an unknown man who possesses one of Abra Kadabra's old wands.

===''Flashpoint''===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Abra Kadabra is a television presenter and member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Seven]]. He sends a message about [[Shade, the Changing Man]] believing that Shade was a dangerous lunatic and then reveals the identities of the Secret Seven members.<ref>''Flashpoint: Secret Seven'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>
