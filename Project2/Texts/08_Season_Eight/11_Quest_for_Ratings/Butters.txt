Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.  Will do. Boy, that was a ''great'' episode!  Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show. Well, what are we waitin' for?! Hey, yeah. Uh why I could ''say'' I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.  Lie about celebrities. Oh, boy! Sexy Action School News Team, ho!  Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled? Stupid news hair!  Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us? I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies. Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Heh.  Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em. Woo. We aren't havin' a party.  Eww, it's all thick and g-gooey. Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas. Hey! Let's run naked through the street!  Huh?  Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!  Still no celebrities, Eric. Uh, I'll keep my eyes open.
