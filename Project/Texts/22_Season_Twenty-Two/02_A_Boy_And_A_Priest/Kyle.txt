Oh, there's Butters! No. Just leave it alone, Clyde. Butters brings him everywhere. Why me?  Uh, Butters, can I talk to you really fast? Butters, you know, you can just bring your priest with you everywhere. I mean, sometimes the guys just wanna do stuff and not have a priest around. I'm saying it's just kind of awkward, Butters.  He's bumming everybody out. Nobody wants to hear about Jesus at a birthday party. It's not just me. It's everyone, Butters. He can try all he wants, but he just doesn't belong here.
