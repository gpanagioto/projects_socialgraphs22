 Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while. I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store! Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.  Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing? Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around! Oh, goodie.
