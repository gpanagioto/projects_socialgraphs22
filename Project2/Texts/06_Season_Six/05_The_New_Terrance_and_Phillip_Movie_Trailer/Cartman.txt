All right! Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are? I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd! Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name?  Stan, okay. What's your name?  Kyle. What's your name?  Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break. Amen. What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated.   Dude, do you wanna see the Terrance & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that?  Okay, how about ... that?   It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole! I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.  Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!  Huh. Ohmigod! Huh. God, when is this gonna get to the commercials?  Argh! We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.  Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih! There, you got it, you got it! Oh, thank God. We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials. This TV is great, Chef. Aagh! God-dammit!  This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that. Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me! Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it!  Here we go! That's it? That's all the commercials? Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now! Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people! Eewww! God, I '''hate''' old people! And '''my''' house is being fumigated!  Leave no doughnut behind!  Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding! The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on!  These commercials are all so God-damn stupid! You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.   Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too. You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to see. Yeah, it sure does!
