From the producers of ''Women Of Rock Live'' and ''The Rockefeller Tree Lighting Ceremony'', it's the holiday television event of the season! With appearances by  And Michael Jackson's hologram as Peter Pan. And featuring live commentary the entire show by CartmanBrah. There's something for every generation to bring families together. It's all live and it's all magical. It's the Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special. And now, together at last, Iggy Azalea and Elvis.
