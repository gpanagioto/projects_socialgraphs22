'''Morgan Edge''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Originally a supporting character, he is a media mogul who acquires ''[[The Daily Planet]]'' and employs [[Clark Kent]] as a television journalist for his WGBS TV network. After the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earth]]'' series which led to a revision of the [[DC Universe]], the character was changed to a [[Superman]] villain and one of the known leaders of [[Intergang]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=[[Del Rey Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=81–83}}</ref>

[[Adrian Pasdar]] portrayed Morgan Edge in the [[Arrowverse]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''. In ''[[Superman & Lois]]'', [[Adam Rayner]] played a version of the character who is also Superman's Kryptonian half-brother named Tal-Rho.

==Publication history==
Morgan Edge first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'' #133 and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=99}}</ref> Kirby based his physical appearance on actor [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], while his personality was inspired by television executive [[James T.

Given the shady background of [[Kinney National Company|the company]] that acquired [[Warner Bros.]] and [[DC Comics|DC]], it was something of an inside joke".<ref name="back91"/> However, under prodding from editorial staff who preferred Edge to be an ongoing supporting character rather than a villain who would ultimately have to be brought to justice (and thus written out of the series), the "Morgan Edge" connected to [[Intergang]] was revealed to be an imposter.<ref name="back91"/>

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
In his original incarnation, Edge was the president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System (owners of television station WGBS), the media corporation which eventually bought the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Edge was in many ways a stereotype of a ruthless capitalist, intervening in the ''Planet''{{'}}s homey atmosphere and challenging the authority of the somewhat older [[Perry White]], but he was a decent man who had moments of good-heartedness and maintained reasonably friendly relationships with most of his employees, including [[Superman|Clark Kent]]. Following the takeover of the ''Planet'', Edge transferred Kent to the news division, making him a traveling correspondent and later anchorman on WGBS. This move added several TV co-workers to the ''Superman'' supporting cast, including fretful producer Josh Coyle, sports broadcaster [[Steve Lombard]],<ref name="superman264">{{Cite comic | writer = Cary Bates | penciller = Curt Swan | inker = Murphy Anderson | story = Secret of the Phantom Quarterback! | title = '''Superman''' | volume =  | issue = #264 | date = '''June 1973''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref> weather forecaster Oscar Asherman, and co-anchor [[Lana Lang]] (who had been one of Clark's childhood friends in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]]).

As one of the wealthiest men in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Edge was a major political figure in the city and frequently encountered [[Superman]], the subject of many of his network's news stories, whom he, like most others, failed to realize was also Clark Kent. Although rarely integral to a plotline, Edge was a supporting character in many Superman stories.

For a while it appeared that Edge was connected to the [[Apokolips]]-sponsored crime organisation [[Intergang]], but this was revealed to be a clone created by the 'Evil Factory', a genetics laboratory working for Darkseid.<ref>''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #152 (September 1972)</ref> For example, this clone attempted to have [[Jimmy Olsen]], the [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]] and, incidentally, a random ''Daily Planet'' employee named Goody Rickels, a [[Don Rickles]] lookalike, murdered as part of a cover-up.<ref>''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #139 (August 1971). DC Comics.</ref>

It was later revealed that Morgan Edge's birth name was '''Morris Edelstein'''. After he won his first TV station in a game of poker, Morris Edelstein changed his name to Morgan Edge because he was ashamed of his lower-class Jewish background and kept the details of his past closely guarded.<ref>''Action Comics'' #468. DC Comics.</ref>

===Post-Crisis===
When DC [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was rebooted after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Edge remained president of WGBS, but his ties to the ''Planet'' and friendship with Superman were [[retcon]]ned away, and he was genuinely connected to Intergang. He was eventually exposed by the ''Daily Planet'', in articles by Clark Kent and [[Cat Grant]], who was working for WGBS undercover. Edge was imprisoned, but even managed to cause trouble there by publishing his [[autobiography]] ''On the Edge'', which dumped upon his father [[Vincent Edge]] as well as Cat Grant, revealing that she slept her way into a scoop. After his release from jail, Morgan Edge returned as sponsor of the [[Superman Revenge Squad]]. Prior to his imprisonment, one of his actions generated much fan anger, in which Edge sadistically and gleefully ran over a [[raccoon]] on the road, prompting one fan to write in saying "[[Lex Luthor]] treats people like animals, but even he does not run them over intentionally".

Recently, Morgan Edge has resurfaced as a powerful media pundit, with the show ''Edge of Reason'', where he gives off anti-Kryptonian spin for [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Lane]]. He is also seen in a "flash-forward" panel in ''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #1, making a mysterious deal with [[Despero]].<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #1. DC Comics.</ref>

===The New 52===
In 2011, "[[The New 52]]" rebooted the DC universe. Morgan Edge appears as a powerful and self-centered media mogul and the new owner of the ''Daily Planet'', he is seen as the sponsor of the [[Challengers of the Unknown]] program before they all leave due to his ruthless business strategy. This version of Morgan Edge is depicted as a bald [[African American]] man with a goatee.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 3) #1 (October 2011). DC Comics.</ref> Although a tough businessman, Edge did recognize talent, and awarded Lois Lane the editorship of the ''Daily Planet''.

Edge's multiple media holdings become a benefit to Superman as Lois Lane, now director of Edge's Metropolis news station, has said building's security cameras "hacked" to provide vital intelligence on a rampaging villain.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 3) #2 (December 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

Prior to ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', in the last issue of the 2011 Justice League series, it is mentioned that [[Lex Luthor]] had bought the Daily Planet from him.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #52. DC Comics.</ref>
