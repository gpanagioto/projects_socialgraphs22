 I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!  I gotta get home for dinner.  God! I'm outta here; see ya guys.  They're in London too? Where's dad? Why? Oh Jesus Christ!  You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night. So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs? Over two hundred bucks. Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, ''we'' could do that!  Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer. Yeah! Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars?  There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make ''bank''! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs. All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam! Ya see, Craig?  Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first.  This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?!  Come on, guys.  Jesus Christ! Hey, back off! Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute? No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian- Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us. This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band. We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money. We we speak English! Help you how? Kyle, calm down. One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic.  Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.  Yes! All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
