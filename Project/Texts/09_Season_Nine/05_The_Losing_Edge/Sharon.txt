Randy, sit down. Randy, don't! Randy... What? Why? You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Why wouldn't you go and support him? What-?  So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch! No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself. Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me!
