I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company.  Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town. As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box.  We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?  Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV? Oh, you can't?  Hey guys, can I help you?  Ohhh, you don't want cable anymore? You don't like paying for all the channels?  Ohh, our company actually packages channels together. Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way.  Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages. Oh, sure. Hey David? I guess if you don't wanna be  forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether. Oh it is?
