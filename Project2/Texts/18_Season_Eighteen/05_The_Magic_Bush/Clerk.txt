Hello, can I help you? You wanna return it? The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it?  Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.  Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it.  Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?
