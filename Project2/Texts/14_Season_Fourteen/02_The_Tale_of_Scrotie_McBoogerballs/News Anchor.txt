It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called "literary genius." ''The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs'' hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting. The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages. The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold "Butters" Stotch.
