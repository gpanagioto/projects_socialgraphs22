Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool. Jesus, dude. I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny? What?! Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure? So what happens to us now? Oh God, it's true.  Butters! Butters, stop it!  Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny! No! Butters, stop!  Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us! Hello? Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet. Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions.  Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease.  Okay so, what exactly are we doing now? ...As soon as what's dead?  I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything. What? What bastard?
