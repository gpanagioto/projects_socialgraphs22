Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'. I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time. Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart.
