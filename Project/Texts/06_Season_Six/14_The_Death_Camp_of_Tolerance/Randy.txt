Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage.   Aw I'm surprised at ''you'', Stanley. I really thought ''you'' knew how to accept people for who they were. No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!    Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture. That's our Cartman.  Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys? Well I really thought you boys learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers! Oh my God. He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way ''this'' asshole was acting. We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
