Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense! Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us!  Yeah, that would kill all our careers! 
 Hello. Mr. Cunt. Things... have not turned out the way they were supposed to. This election was stolen. And while this government is still in power, we have to prove it. We've come to ask for your help. Leave us.  As I understand, there's quite a lot you've done online you don't wanna have come out. But I also understand you weren't trying to get a woman to kill herself. You were just being funny. The Trolltrace program is the most sophisticated of its kind. The government has only a few short weeks to try and use that technology to stop the President-elect from taking office. You've proven one thing: that you have the ability to pretend to be someone you're not. We wanna send someone into Denmark undercover and steal their technology. Totally like James Bond. You and I need each other, Skank. What do you say? 
And I'll take the pledge.
