==Concept and creation==
Barton, with the alter ego of Hawkeye, was first introduced in Marvel comic books as a reluctant villain, in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (September 1964). After two more appearances as a villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joined the ranks of the Avengers in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #16 (May 1965). He then became a perennial member of the team.

In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Barton. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220510010500/http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |archive-date=May 10, 2022 |url-status=live  }}</ref> After initially offering the role of Barton to [[Jensen Ackles]], who had auditioned for the part of Captain America, Marvel hired Jeremy Renner to portray the character on screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/actors-who-turned-down-the-mcu/|title=15 Actors Who Turned Down MCU|date=September 29, 2017|website=CBR}}</ref>

Much of Clint's background and characterization in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was inspired by his [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation, particularly him being a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and secretly having a wife and three children. His origin story in Earth-616 of him being a circus performer and former criminal trained by Swordsman is not included, though several elements of this version are implemented such as him becoming Ronin and eventually requiring hearing aids.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lealos |first1=Shawn |title=10 Biggest Differences Between Hawkeye In The Movies And The Comics |url=https://screenrant.com/hawkeye-differences-marvel-comics-mcu-disney-plus-clint-barton/ |website=Screen Rant|date=December 2021 }}</ref> His story and characterization in the ''Hawkeye'' television series were primarily influenced by [[Matt Fraction|Matt Fraction's]] 2012 comic run with the character.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davids |first=Brian |date=November 19, 2021 |title='Hawkeye' EP Trinh Tran on Casting Hailee Steinfeld and the Influence of 'Better Call Saul' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/hawkeye-movie-tv-show-marvel-disney-1235050780 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119235127/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/hawkeye-movie-tv-show-marvel-disney-1235050780/ |archive-date=November 20, 2021 |access-date=November 20, 2021 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

However, Barton is seriously injured by [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro Maximoff]] and a Hydra weapon, but is healed by Dr. [[Helen Cho]] at the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Avengers Tower]].

They succeed, and Barton transports the sentient body back to the Avengers Tower. He also tracks a captured Romanoff's signal in Sokovia.

There, Barton reunites with Romanoff, participates in the battle against Ultron, convinces Wanda to become an Avenger, and is saved by Pietro who sacrifices his life to shield Barton and a Sokovian child from gunfire. After the battle, Barton goes into retirement and returns home, where he and Laura name their newborn son Nathaniel Pietro Barton, in honor of Romanoff and Pietro.

However, they are intercepted by Stark's team consisting of Rhodes, Romanoff, [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], and Vision. After Rogers and Barnes escape, Barton is among those captured and imprisoned in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Raft|the Raft]]. When Stark visits the facility, Barton openly berates him. Later, Rogers breaks him, Lang, Wilson, and Maximoff out, and he and Lang negotiate deals with the U.S. government in accordance with the accords to receive a term of [[house arrest]] instead.

===Ronin and the Time Heist===
{{see|Avengers: Endgame}}
In 2018, Barton, still on house arrest, enjoys a picnic with his family, but is caught off-guard when Laura, Lila, Cooper, and Nathaniel suddenly [[The Blip|vanish]].

Barton volunteers to test out the quantum tunnel and is transported into the [[Quantum Realm]] where he travels to an alternate timeline seeing his house and hearing his daughter's voice before being transported back. After the Avengers formulate a plan to retrieve the Infinity Stones from different points in time, Barton and Romanoff travel to an alternate 2014 timeline.

Travelling in the ''Benatar'' through space, they land on the planet [[Vormir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vormir]] and are met by the [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Red Skull]], who tells them that in order to retrieve the [[Soul Stone]], a life sacrifice is required.

=== Meeting Kate Bishop ===
{{See also|Hawkeye (2021 TV series)}}
{{Further|Never Meet Your Heroes|Hide and Seek (Hawkeye)|Echoes (Hawkeye)|l2=Hide and Seek|l3=Echoes}}
One year later, Barton, now wearing a [[hearing aid]], spends time with his children in New York City for [[Christmas]], attending a [[Broadway theatre]] musical about Steve Rogers and the Avengers. Barton leaves early due to being bothered by the portrayal of the Battle of New York and reminders of Romanoff. That night, he learns from local news that someone has acquired his Ronin suit and is fighting the Tracksuit Mafia while wearing it. After rescuing the disguised individual from the Mafia, he unmasks the individual and finds out it is a young woman named [[Kate Bishop (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kate Bishop]], a skilled archer who grew up idolizing him after he unknowingly saved her during the Battle of New York.

Bishop takes Barton back to her apartment, but they are attacked by the Mafia and forced to leave the Ronin suit behind as they evacuate with [[Lucky the Pizza Dog|Lucky]], a one-eyed [[golden retriever]] that Bishop rescued and adopted earlier. After relocating to Bishop's aunt's apartment, Barton sends his children back home the next morning, promising to return by Christmas Day. He escorts Bishop to her work and then recovers the Ronin suit from a [[Live action role-playing game|LARP]] event in [[Central Park]]. Later, Barton allows himself to be captured by the Mafia to learn more about their plans. Bishop, unaware of this, tracks down Barton's location to rescue him and gets captured in the process. [[Maya Lopez (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maya Lopez]] interrogates him on Ronin's true identity and Barton tells her that Ronin was killed by Romanoff. After managing to free himself and Bishop, the two work together to battle and evade Lopez and the Mafia at the [[Manhattan Bridge]].

==== Investigating the Tracksuit Mafia ====
{{Further|Hawkeye (2021 TV series)#Episodes{{!}}Echoes|Partners, Am I Right?}}
Barton, accompanied by Bishop and Lucky, obtains a new hearing aid and then goes to the penthouse of Bishop's mother, Eleanor, to learn more about the Tracksuits using her mother's company's database. However, Bishop gets locked out of her mother's account, and Barton is confronted by [[Jack Duquesne]], the fiancé of Bishop's mother who possesses Barton's Ronin sword. The situation is diffused after Eleanor and Duquesne recognize him. Eleanor asks him to keep Bishop out of his investigation as he secretly takes back his sword. With the help of his wife Laura, Barton discovers that Duquesne is the CEO of Sloan Limited, a [[shell company]] that [[money laundering|launders money]] for the Tracksuits. That night, Bishop throws him and Lucky a small Christmas party to make up for missing time with his family, and the two bond over various activities. Barton tells Bishop about his past with Romanoff as she deduces that he was Ronin.

The next day, Barton locates Lopez's lieutenant, Kazi Kazimierczak, and demands he convince Lopez to end her vendetta against Ronin. Afterwards, Laura informs Barton that a [[Rolex]] watch recovered from the Avengers Compound stolen by the Tracksuits is sending out tracking signals from an apartment building. Barton and Bishop go to retrieve it, and ultimately find the watch in Lopez's apartment, where she also keeps notes on Barton and his family. As Bishop battles Lopez, Barton is ambushed by a masked assassin who is revealed to be [[Yelena Belova (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yelena Belova]], who is targeting him after learning of his involvement in Romanoff's death,{{efn|name=Black Widow|As depicted in ''[[Black Widow (2021 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2021).}} before she escapes. Barton decides that he cannot keep putting Bishop in danger and breaks off their partnership.

====Hunted by Lopez and Belova====
{{Further|Ronin (Hawkeye episode)|So This Is Christmas?|l1=Ronin}}
Barton takes shelter at the apartment of his new friend, [[FDNY]] firefighter Grills. He visits the local Avengers memorial and speaks to the late Romanoff, apologizing aloud for what he is about to do. Barton sets a meeting with Lopez where he dons the Ronin suit, quickly incapacitates all of her men, and fights and defeats Lopez. He spares her life and unmasks, warning her that continued threats toward his family will result in her demise, and reveals that he was tipped off by an [[informant]] working for Lopez's boss who wanted her father dead. Lopez manages to injure Barton who is subsequently saved by Bishop and Lopez flees. Bishop reveals to Barton that Belova is hunting him. Belova sends Bishop a text message informing her that her mother is working with Lopez's boss, who Barton identifies as organized crime boss [[Wilson Fisk (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wilson Fisk]].

Barton watches a video Belova sent Bishop and learns that Eleanor killed Armand and set up Dusquense to take the fall. On Christmas Eve, Barton and Bishop attend Eleanor’s holiday party at [[Rockefeller Center]]. Kazi attempts to assassinate Eleanor on Fisk's order, but later targets Barton. Barton enlists the help of Grills and the LARPers to evacuate the party guests, then later rejoins Bishop and defeats the Tracksuit Mafia. Bishop later departs to look for Eleanor, while Barton is confronted by Belova, who demands the truth of Romanoff's death. Barton complies but the struggle leads to a fight in which Barton eventually convinces Belova to stand down and spare his life. In the aftermath, Eleanor is arrested by the police for Armand's murder, while Fisk manages to escape but is later shot by Lopez. On Christmas Day, Barton departs New York in a car with Bishop and Lucky. Once home, he introduces Bishop and Lucky to his family, witnesses his children opening their presents, returns the stolen watch, a S.H.I.E.L.D. memento, to his wife Laura, and later burns the Ronin suit with Bishop.

Polly Conway of ''[[Common Sense Media]]'' found Barton to be a positive role model across ''[[Hawkeye (2021 TV series)|Hawkeye]]'', writing, "Hard work, perseverance, and courage are all clear themes.
