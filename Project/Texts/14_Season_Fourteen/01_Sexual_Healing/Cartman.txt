 Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox.  Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash!  Oh dude, was that a combo move? Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie. Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time. I told you this game was sweet, dude. Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that? Oh, you're going down, Elin! Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up? Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone?? What the hell?! This game's all boring now! Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
