 I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!  No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand. Noo!! Nooo!! How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?! Oh God...  Okay, how long now?  HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH! Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!  Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer? Oh God! Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!! You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me. I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.  No. There ''is'' something I can do. All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it. Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me. It's simple science, Kyle. I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!! I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself!   Ey! Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!  No! No, it's too soon! Butters, get your coat. We gotta go. You're gonna help me freeze myself.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?! No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right? All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!  Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze. Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do. Where am I? Safe where, butthole?!  What?? Butters? Butters, you black asshole?!  Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii? Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe! I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii! No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future.  What??  YES!! YES!! So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go! I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.  And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how? Who?  Who are they?? Jesus Christ! I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii. What??
