 Babe, I have no idea what any of this means. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it.   , Dude, I am so not getting this.  I don't understand what any of these symbols mean, so in my head I'm trying to replace them with something I know to try and see patterns. And when I do that, I can see how everything lines up except for one thing. . These two don't line up, babe. The only things that are out of order.  Excuse me. Is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence? That stuff there. Its in the wrong place. It needs to come before that.
