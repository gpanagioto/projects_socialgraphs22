You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want. Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like ''this''. Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like ''this''. Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like ''this''. Alright-y then. Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.  Alrighty then, let's get started! Mr. Garrison. ''Mr. Garrison.'' The operation is over, Mr. Garrison. You look great! Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, snapped some cartilage... ...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart. By the way, did you ever see that movie ''Contact''? I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest. I'll check on you a little later. Okay, only a few more bandages to go. Take a look for yourself. Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll ''really'' notice the difference.
