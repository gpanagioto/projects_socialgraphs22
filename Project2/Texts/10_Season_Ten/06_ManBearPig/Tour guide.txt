Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado.  Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready? Let's go cavin'.  Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.  Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's... These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named "The Hanging Mushroom."  Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees. Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem? All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name.  In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear.  O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now!  Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see?  Oh Jesus, here we go again.
