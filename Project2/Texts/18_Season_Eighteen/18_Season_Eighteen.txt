Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest. Protruding vaginal boner. Oh, I like that.  Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On! Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated! You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it! It's the greatest startup company name EVER!  Washington. Redskins.  It's sooo sweet! It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo! Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable! Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!  It's a strong name, dude. It's like aggressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken. We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down. I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention! Sittin' on our asses, here we come!  By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge. Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our Kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye. Yes, I know. Oh, cool. Please take a seat. Nice, I like that. Stop? But why? Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that? How is it offensive? Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people.  Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself.  Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid! Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk! Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys! NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator! It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters. Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man! Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!" Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle? Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too? Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye.  Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  Goooood morning, guys! We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth! What?! Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle! You son of a bitch! You broke Kickstarter! Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be! Well, somebody did!   It is really sweet. Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it. You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo.  I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch.  Whoa, whoa! What?  How's it going, everybody? Hey dude. Sup?  What do you mean? We're just... going to school. Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was- Dude, people are pissed off at us. Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance? You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool! Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them. Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for... What? We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band! Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live. So who do we throw the party for? You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time. You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson. "I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes." Believe it, dude. What the hell is gluten? KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE! THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY! KYYYLE! What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck. What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde. You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.  There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse. Aunt Jemima.  I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima. I don't even know what that means. Are you going to eat those pancakes? Oooo, trippy... They've got what backward?   Oh! Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck, I want pancakes. KYYYLE! KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMID! My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid. What, what is it? What is it for? It's upside down. Sir, the pyramid is upside down. Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like. Yeah yeah, enjoy the party.    We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess. Good for you.  No, God damn it, no!  Who's takin' a shit?! I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig! Son of a bitch!  Oh, no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time! ALL RIGHT, THAT DOES IT!  I'm going to the potty. Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger. Did you notice the bow?  Aaahhh! Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls' bathroom a long time ago. It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too.  Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girl's shitter. Yeah uh-huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy, but I'm really a girl. That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws. Erica. All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers. There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead. Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls. Okay, okay, okay, you guys! You know what? You know what?  Suck my clit and balls. I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem.  Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom? OH MY GOD!!! Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location. Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out. Oh on that side? Oh, I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.  Oh my God, this is so awesome, you guys! It's just like at home! Yup! You know what Hillary says: "You can suck my clit and balls."  Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied! DUDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING BATHROOM! I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment! Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy! BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CHICK WATCHING ME GO POO! NO! I IDENTIFY AS A CHICK, BUT I'M STILL A BOY. YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SHARE A BATHROOM WITH A GIRL THAT IDENTIFIES HERSELF AS A FUCKING DUDE!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!  Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog! Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  HEY, WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE?! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT! Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?! He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night! Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?! At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies! Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?! I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded.   Hey, douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid! No, it isn't. That's stupid. I'm dying of boredom.  What did you say? Your dad has a fucking drone? Whooaa!   You wanna take it out for a spin?  Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone! Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know. Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone! Oh, shit, it's your dad! Go, go, go!  I'll see you later at my house. Butters, is that you?  Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?! Alright, come in.  It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house! Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes. Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush! This thing is recording, right? Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  His dad sees you! Fly back to the house, stupid! Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone! Not a word, Kenny! Hey, you guys. You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush? Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out?  You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.  Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro. Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny? I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it. Whoa, Butters, chillax, bro. Butters- Butters. Butters. Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet! Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it! Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass!  What?  What does that have to do with me? Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude. You were what?! You were spying on me?! But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle! You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that ''not'' spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy!  Butters. Because, Butters-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video. Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one." Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from '''Hunger Games''' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass! Oh hey Butters. Sup? Dude, what's the matter? Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here.  Butters.  Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters. Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones. Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing. Your dad's drone. Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!  Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff. It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom.  Well, you see, Butters, everything worked out.  "Oh, thank you, Eric. I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."  Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy. You're welcome.   What are you two boners doing? I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks. How much money did you micropay today, Stan? Yes. Jimmy told ''me'' about this game. The?! Everyone we know says they heard about it from you! It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!  And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?! That makes sense. It's done.  The word is out.  It's trending. Cool.  Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  But I'm sure they will soon.  Butters, no! Are you crazy?! What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub?? You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?! You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that?? You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies, Butters. You have to hurry! Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it! Welcome back, dude. How do you feel? Do you feel okay? And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, "Whoa, I'm back."  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever! Come on, guys! This is the ''cure de gars'' of Butters' torture! Thank you, Kyle. Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?! Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again. Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh? See? He's an asshole. Fuck him. Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters? Even 10% is good enough. Here you go.   Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?  All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside. Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work. You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow. Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money. Just take the money, Butters!  You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point. Yeah, Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Alright, Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.  Uh, Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now. Butters, it's, uhh, time to stop. Get back to my place. Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now? Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay? Wait, hang on Butters! Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing! Butters?? Butters??  Butters.  Are you okay? I'm ''not'' here, Butters. This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  is real. Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality.  You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam.  Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.  Butters. I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet!  I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello? With what?  Fuck you! Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality. Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.  Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now. Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you!  Are you fucking with me?! Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?! Because if you are, it's not cool! Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality! Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program! That's right! THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life? Well if you get grounded in virtual reality, you get grounded in real life too... FOREVER!  It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool.  I know. Let's go to the backyard.  Okay Kyle. Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?  Mmmhmm. And why did the guys send you, Kyle? Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on. I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle. Calm down. In virtual reality, yes you did. You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!  Fuck! Or if I did? What?  Hello? Dude. NOW this is getting weird!  No, you guys. This is virtual reality. Because... I'm a computer program. I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real. I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service. You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me! Alright, Stan, just sit down at the computer.   What's this?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy. Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right. Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch. This asshole needs to make a move already! He's playing an enchantment. Dude, it was complete brutality! At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro! Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive! Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.  Kewwwl! What's hardcore and exciting about Shitty shrimp?  Dude, do we look like police? Five dorrah?!  Dude, that was total carnage! Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped? We're going again on Friday, right? What's the matter Kenny? You feel bad for the roosters? Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder. Huh? A little bit? What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys.  Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"? Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens? Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny? What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?  Come on, McNuggets! Fight! All right, McNuggets!  That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls' volleyball. Thank you so very much. You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues! We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit. Oh Jesus, give it a rest already. OOHHH!!   Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that. Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time.  Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic. Ten dorrah?!  Who is that?? Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen! McNuggets is scared, dude! This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter. Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit! Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack. Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health. Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer. Ah, dude, your dad's here. It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hand that the fucking cops had to come and break it up. Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny? He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how? Hey bros, what's going on? This is <sup>CartmaaanBrah</sup>!

No, we don't wanna do anything. ...Nnnno, there isn't.  What? I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.  I like it!  You alright dude? What?!  I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either. Yeah... I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC." Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"? Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title. I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it. Good luck with your company, dude. It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other. And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out, Boy, this is the life, huh guys? But you all thought our name was sweet. Morning!  Hey Wendy. Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out. So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie- Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing. Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says?   For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on! Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something. What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down.  Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him. Sweet! Excuse me? Wait, wait, ah I might need those. We can't let our party suck.  Dad? Dad! Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something? Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you? Nonono, not yet. DAD! Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD! Let me talk to my dad!  There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have. I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but- Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now... We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid! Hey Wendy, you havin' fun? Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me. What does that mean? What is that? Cartman's a girl now?  What? Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you. Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex? ...What? Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle. The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you? Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl. Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good. ...I don't know where I belong... I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused. To the bathroom? Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know? I know.  Sup?  What? Let ''me'' see. How'd you get that on your phone? I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much. You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough. I'll pay you back for it, okay?! I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ! Ohhh hey guys. Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best. Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do? Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto.  You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play? It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out. It's just... Yeah, it's fun. Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it. ...Free?  I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up. One? No, no, it's not. I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer! Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand. It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse. How? I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way?  Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them. Okay. So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me? So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything? The addict people said something about me filling a hole. Yeah, no, this is great. I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there? That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications.  Ah, Canada? ...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!  Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay.  I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie. We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps. That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking. Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies.   Butters, what the hell are you doing? Sound pretty typical to me. Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone? Kyle, maybe this is for real. In on what?  Fuck you! "Fuck you" what? Oh fuck you! No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help!  It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real. No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time. How do you know? What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service? Butters called Customer Service first? Come on, we're going to Butters' house!  Butters. So now we ''are'' in the real world. Yes, we're here.  Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality? What?!  That doesn't make sense!  Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there? Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point.  Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?  Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.  It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck. Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls' volleyball.  Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked. Shhh! What's that? This late? It was seriously almost hard to watch.   Wendy, did you hear about last night? Not that. Did you actually go to that? Pfft, whatever. We're men. Uhhh, Mitchell the Janitor sent us? That was freakin' hardcore. It was just decimation. Hell yeah!  What's mean about it? Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard. Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster. Dad, it's not that big a deal. Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic. Do you think they're happy? Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?  Hey, how about this little guy? Yeah! Gee, thanks! Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit. Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.  What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage? Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?! What did he play? Did he tap all his mana? Does an Overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?!  Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys. A way to finally do something good for other people. I don't get it. The whole fun of ''Call of Duty'' is that you get to do the shooting. What are you talking about? Hey, what's up? Oh no, what now? Yeah? Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on! Grandpa? Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?! We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool! Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad? Tell me about it.  Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store. Who did? That's a little strange, isn't it? That self-promoting asshole! Because my dad's an idiot! Nnnothing, nothing. We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped! Yeah, you damn kids! Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere! Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad. He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care. It just all seemed so... stupid. Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again. What??  Dude. You're such a grandpa. I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's great too. Barking vaginal belch. Bloody butt cough. How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?! It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue. Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company. What?! Tell us! Washington Redskins? What?! Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal. Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for. I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to. No way!  Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them. People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything! That's the Catholic Church! That's the NFL! All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking. Maybe I'll start my own company. I don't want to! It's a stupid name!  Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is. It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go! You okay, bro? Give it time, it'll grow on you. Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan! Well whattaya mean? Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back.  Yeah. Good luck with yours.  What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter.  What?! No, I just can't get it to load. My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?! He's right. We should do a merger. Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it. Whattaya say, Cartman?  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%. What the heck is that?  Change our name? When was that? Well what the hell do we do? Hey guys! Sup, Jason?  Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out. We were- trying to be funny. Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore? Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school. I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us. Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.  Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us. No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go. A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde? Yeah, it's going to be this weekend. Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live! Hey Cartman. Dude, calm down. Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell? Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up. That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan? Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up. We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now! Jesus Christ, dude. Cartman? Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man. We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us.  Are you okay, Cartman?   Then don't eat 14 Eggo waffles for lunch, fatass! Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore. That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it. Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing. That's terrible! Are you happy now?! Is, is this? Do you think this is cool? See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody! I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what- I was in the bathroom- No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking! How is that spying?!  Hey, Jimmy. What's up? Oh. Really?  Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out. What? This is stupid! It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it! Who makes this crap? You... missed school today? Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day? You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium? Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game? Kenny, who told you about this game? Dude, what?! Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?  Dude, what are you doing?! You need to stop recommending that app to people!  Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?! You just push it on other people?! Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?! But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?! You ''have'' your crutches! You're saying these games do this on purpose?! Sure. Come on, guys.   We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then- Wuh, what's done? Hey dude. Y-you alright? ''Coup de grah'', Cartman Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized! You should probably listen to him, dude.  Maybe we are.  Hello? Again? Uh huh. Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now. You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?  Fuck you! Get up, Cartman! Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso?!  You're goin' to the hospital!  Fuck you if you're in on this. Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service. Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset. Kyle. I don't care! You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!  Fuck you! He said they're doing a Total Recall. You haven't done anything yet! We need help! Our friend is in a coma! Hey, Cartman, I need to talk to you. Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible. Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here. Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here. I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me. Www-what do you mean? Fuck you! Don't... do that! NO! I put your headset on, and came here to- No. Then I came into this virtual space. Fuck you! Why would they send ''you'' in to convince ''me'' of anything?! Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there? Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?  Dude... What? Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality? Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then- Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset. God damn it Cartman! He's lying. Why not? Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!  We're right here dude. Do you remember now? We're here, dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this. Alright, dude, take off the headset.  Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus? But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight. Can Kenny block his Elderbeast? He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade! You've never seen anything so ruthless! Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok. It doesn't even look like they're open.  It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of. Yeah, maybe that's just kind of what they do naturally. Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass! You were? Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything. We don't... really know the difference. Then he's perfect for us. Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us? You can do it, McNuggets!  All right, McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?! You mean there's more to this? It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives. Yeah, you gotta know people. This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo. McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play. Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude. Come on, Kenny!  He just had to shuffle it. Holy shit, dude! Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened. Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now? Got what? Nono Dad, please. I just got ''Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare''. Me and Ike are going to play it together. Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship. Yes!  Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new ''Call Of Duty''! Do you wanna go downstairs and play? Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!  Well what are you watching? You're watching someone play ''Call Of Duty'' and talk about it? Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it? Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days. Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame. Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit! All I wanted was to play one level of ''Call of Duty'' and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people. I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary. Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?!   Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me? Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching ''him'' comment on things!  What the fuck?! Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in ''Call of Duty'', go play it downstairs in the living room! What do you think you're doing?! You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?! I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything! This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room! "Let's Plays"? You're not gonna believe this. I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play ''Dragon Age: Inquisition''. Come on!  See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play ''Dragon Age''. And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on ''Dragon Age''. This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid! It's dying. The living room is... dying. I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy. You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.  Do you mind?! Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!  What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and- It's Cartman's stupid online persona! There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart- Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop! THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying! I'm NOT a GRANDPA! Whattaya think? Really?? Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome." But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values. Bill Cosby. Is here. To see me. Hello. We? Wow.  Well that's awesome! M-Ah, I'd love to. Uh okay! No problem!  Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!  Dude, what are you doing?! They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending! These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it! No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now! Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room. That son of a bitch! Why would he do this?! Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?! Mom?! Where is Ike?! That's ''not'' what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?! Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room! WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS! Cartman, open this door right now! What the hell are you doing?! Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door! Because you just said, "here in my room"! What are you talking about, Stan? Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped. I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.  Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad. How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you? I am so confused.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again. Help? How can you help? Really? That's what you guys would do? Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!  PewDiePie?! Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night. Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats. No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great. (Dilapidated titties incorporated.) (Me too!) (Yahoo!)  (What?!) (Yeah, it's fucking crazy!) (Right. What the fuck is going on?) (A party?!) (This will be awesome!) (Okay, try to get closer!) (Are you serious?!) (Stop taping!) (Yeah.) (Yeah, I know, dude.) (Alright!)  (Dude! What the fuck!) (Dude!)  (Uh huh.) (Jimmy.) (Fuck?!) (Yeah!)  (You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!)  (You see? Look at all this dried up food. He must have been here for ''days''!) (Yeah!)  (What??)  (This isn't a prank, Kyle!) (What?) (I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)  (Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.) (No.) (NO.) (Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.) (Commentary?)  Rotten boobie turds! Man this sucks! Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.  We already got a dollar! One dollar pledge! Another two dollars!  Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Oh no! Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here. Happy Deadline Day! Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning! It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary! Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground! Somebody killed Kickstarter! Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times! We finally did it!  Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.  I think someone's in there. That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom. He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me.  Holy moly! [Wendy pulls out a key and goes into the Other bathroom]  Hey! Everything okay, Stan? Just hold it. That's what I do now.  Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?! Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy! Hey! Where do you think you're going?! Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  ''Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.'' Hey, Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took. I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato. My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake. You can see the momma bird fly in. We took all kinds of video with his drone.  You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere, and shoot video, and stuff. It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers. Are you crazy?! This is my ''dad's'' drone! My dad said it's not for spying on people. Oh, he'll know. You can hear it take off.  No, Eric. I don't wanna d- Comin', Dad!  Yes, it's me. Of course not! What?! You said nobody would know! Be careful! The powerlines! Okay, uh, maybe that's enough.   Let me see! Jeeeeezz! What do I do?!  I don't know what to do!  Oh, heh-hey, Dad.  Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask? I love you too, Dad.  What the heck are you doing?! When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?! You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble! Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing! WHY?! I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand! Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?! Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?! Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?! Why?! That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig. Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy. I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll- I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses! I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it! I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does! You do? What? NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna- ...Okay. If this doesn't work, we're dead. Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy. No! No, no! I'm sorry. Thank you, Eric! I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass! Congratulations, Kyle. Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one.  We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game. WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it. I feel Stan! He looks totally real! More of the school.  The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.  What what what?  Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot! I'm sorry! Yeah.  Okay, I'm back in your room!  Wow! That was cool! I touched Wendy's boob.  Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric? Yeah.  Well, not a hundred percent... Okay, subject is ready. Interim status is go. It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal. Going now!  Okay. How much more of this am I supposed to clear up? Okay. It's so realistic.  Alright, I think that's all of it.  There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me! Okay, I got it! Already? Oh no! I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick.  Hello, Dad! It's me, Butters! This is for all the times I got grounded!  HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?! Huh, that was incredible! I feel amazing!   Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like ''Grand Theft Auto''! Whoa! I'm in the car now. Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here. I'm gonna beat her up and take her money! Take that, you dumb hooker! I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me. I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH! I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality. Aw nuts! I wonder how long I'm grounded for? Ahhh! Eric! Uh what are you doing here? What?  Nuh uh! WHAT??   Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop! Ah how do you know that?! Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine! NO!  Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this! ...What? What do you mean? I don't know what you mean. Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world! Oh really? Oh, that's a relief. Oh gosh! OH GOSH! Yeah. Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded! No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle! I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense! PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the- Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh-    you guys can't be here. Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors. When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life. YES.  AAaaghagh! Huh I'm sorry Dad!  Ahhh, huh? You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded? They did it!  Whoopie!  Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore. Oh no! Kenny! But he's dying!  Dangit, I wish I knew people.  Yeah. Wow, the cops came? What's a PewDiePie do? Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich. It's true! Heheyehah. Hmmm, it's kind of gay. I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know? Well, gay is wholesome.  Nope, sorry. Nnnnnope. That's taken too. Sorry. I told you, you just have to be really original with with your company name. There's a lot of startup company these days.  That's available! Congratulations!  Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school? A startup company? A company that does what? Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.  Make your dick fly off? What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars? Hamburger Helper? There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon! Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS! This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan! Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?! Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you! You sure? All r- all right, you got those?! All right, come on!  Son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah!  Yes? Gluten expohn... oh not here! Wuh sure!  Well that's just a beer.  beer is bad for you?! Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick? No! Not Papa John's.  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!! How long do I have to stay here?! What am I supposed to eat? Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.  Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay? I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand? How's your mom? Your, your sister? That's my son, you bastard! Staaan! Staaaaaaan! You can't just keep us in here! They don't care about us. Face it. We're already dead to them.  Are you crazy? Oh my God, you...  But... you're okay. Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who could get the word out. Ng-oh.  <poem><i> Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.</i></poem> <poem><i>We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.</i></poem>  Aaah, I don't know. Why? In my jeans?  ...Yeah. I do. Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel. You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?! Every time? Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup.  <poem><i>Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.</i></poem>  <poem><i>Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.</i></poem>  Shelly, that's enough time on your phone. You know we're all cutting down on phone time.  Oh really? A-About... about what? Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde. It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down. Yah, that's my cover. Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs. Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."</i></poem> Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Stan?  You wanted to see me, boss?  Hi Carol. Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined. I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music. With what?   It's okay, it's gluten free.  I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde. Wacky Races?! Holy shit! I know! Are we watching at your house?! All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today. Geez! Did you see that?! Oh! Ohh! Ohh! Duuude!  Oooo! Booom!  Eeww. It's simple. Oh yeah, this is gonna work great.  Heheh, Gerald is watching ''Housewives of Atlanta.'' I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  No! Noooo! I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere! Okay. No. I didn't.  What might be? ...Drones are spooky? You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?!  You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"? Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough! How?! Can you believe him?! He ''knew'' how much he was spending! He ''knew'' he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.  Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan? I ''had'' a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop. Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  Come on Dad, we're going home. Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit! I just don't understand what is ''wrong'' with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?! It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for! I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp* What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough! $26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?! Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?! You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?! I am not chugging beer!  Oh pass interference! Interference!  Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that.   What are you gaywads doin'? Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine.  It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse. You guys wanna put some money on it?  Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous! It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college. Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely.  Oh? Not impressed? How about this?   Hey! Oh! Oh thank you! Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey! All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback. Oh yehhs yesyesyesyesyesyes, Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college. Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer. People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Hey kids, are we having fun?   Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please! Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!   Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody? Alright, come on up here.  What's your name? All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert! Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no. What is that supposed to mean? Yes, Freemium gaming. I ''love'' Candy Crush. Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up. And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person? You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow. If she means that much to you. How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little. Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work. No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live. Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that! No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models. Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you. Fuck you!  They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong. Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something. Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!   Sorry folks, just one second here. Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo!  Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about? I was told to! Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him!  Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing? Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be- This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth. Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth.  I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do. Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of. I'll do no such thing! You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content? Sharon? Sharon! They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us! The hologram's in our bedroom? You slept with Tupac?! SHARON! Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it. Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde. No! That was a copy of me! Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned! Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde. Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do? A holiday special. Oh my God.  Can you help me stop them?! Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do. We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth! Oh my God... My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world. I guess... one step at a time. Shelly? Um, I'm Lorde. Whew, that was hard.  Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS! THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  Another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the Internet. They're a company that does absolutely nothing, and they're called, the Washington Redskins.  Why did you give five dollars to the Washington Redskins Kickstarter? It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal. I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny.  You are Eric Cartman? My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins Thank you, but I will stand. Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization. Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention! Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization "The Washington Redskins", its offensive to us? We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing! Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency? Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?! What?! That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?! Ugh! This thing is broken! Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again! And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this! The stupid thing isn't working! Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name. And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart? Uh I guess we can live with that. Thank God! Caw-CAW, Caw-CAW.  No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points. Don't let them break you! Don't let them win!    How is it offensive?! Jesus, what-?! Makes us feel like a joke. Oh, God! Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout. You know, when you put your all into something, it's kind of a bummer when people don't seem to care.  Kind of makes you feel like the sport you love is becoming a joke. The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls' volleyball team. All around the world, people are saying they are inspired by the Washington Redskins. The Internet startup company has raised so much money in Kickstarter that now, more groups are doing the same.  More news on the Washington Redskins tonight. Their defiant. F-You attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group ISIS. The terrorists said they admire the Washington Redskins and want to try it and follow their business model. Gerald Broflovski? You've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues. It just... keeps going on and on. Kind of like your...  I mean... it just... goes outside what most people would call... acceptable. I didn't see the video. I don't believe in doing that, but uh... I'm just saying that... the situation in in your town is... unwieldy?  What is that?  Well, let's not forget, Marsha that there's a people here, okay, who are not happy about the use of the name, the Football Washington Redskins! Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them?  Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again. Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on. Do you kids like magic? Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randy!   Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready. Decks??  I'm so confused, babe. Please! Don't take me away from my child!  I will get it right, and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that. We will continue to identify and add expertise to our team. Everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month. We can add... and we will do more, do more, do more   I will get it right. Dan, you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff. Let the Goodell-bot do it. Then it is decided! We will make them change their logo. Begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes NOW Man, that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it. Did you tell them we're about honor and integrity? If we get them to change their logo, will it make you happy? If the Goodell bot is broken, we must stay out of it more than even usual! My eyes aren't too far apart! Go!  It's just... incredible, Harry. Everyone is using Kickstarter for everything! It's like, we don't even have to do anything and we just make money. And for every project funded, we get 5%. Sitting on our asses, here we come.  Go Redskins! A beautiful night in Arlington, Texas as the Dallas Cowboys get set to take on the Washington Redskins. That is, of course, Washington Redskins the football team, not Washington Redskins, the audacious crowd-funding company. You're talking about the crowd-funding company- Redskins, right? Those Redskins And the Cowboys are still set to kick off, but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to. Wait a minute, it appears a lone Redskin is making his way out of the locker room.  You are watching E! Entertainment News! That's how low you've sunk.  And here they are, the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the Wacky Races, competing for the title of the future of transportation. Cars are approaching the starting line. First off is the Lyft car  And this live coverage of the event will be broadcast all morning, of course, on CNN. As the Wacky Racers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear.  And Elon Musk's Tesla appears to take the lead. The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey. And look at this! The Lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger.  Now the Lyft car must take the passenger to her destination, but look at this! The Hummer salesman is running the Lyft car off the road! And the Hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself! Elon Musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the Hummer out of commission for good.  The passenger is being taken to the Tesla D now.  With the race neearly over, it's taxi out in front followed by self-driving car, and then pulling up in third is Handicar! It's gonna be a close one! Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again. And there's Handicar to pick Miss Applegate up.  We're near the finish line; the race is almost over. Handicar is in the lead, still way out in front of the ZipCar driven by Matthew McConaughey.  Dastardly car is racing past both.  Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside. And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it! Tonight on an all-new 20/20.  Now for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush. The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game.  That's one coin. Can you collect more?  Hey, you're really good at this, guy!

That's right. An-and now you've got terrorist groups like ISIS using the Redskins to raise their money. I-I don't like what the Redskins are doing. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, and Jerry Jones must be happy this means a forfeit, another win for the Cowboys.  It's over. Our name has been reduced to a stereotype and a joke. Come on, guys. Yeah, let's just go home. Yeah, but I just feel pretty stupid wearing this now. Yeah. Where will we go? What will we do?  Oh! Yeah! Alright! Ooooooo. Whoa! Whooaa. Ooooohh... Just stay down! For the love of God! Stop! Make it stop! Just stay down! Please! Just make him stay down! Go Redskins! Go Redskins! Change your name! Good for you, ISIS! It doesn't belong in today's society! There's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated. A once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by Cowboys in a defiant last stand! Last night. Until you change your name, we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you. That's right! ISIS will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising! What are you guys doing here? But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.  You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves. Are you guys making this up? All the pizza we can eat? All right, this better be good. You call this a party?! Your party sucks! I knew you guys were going to bail on the party. Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?  Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.   Occupied. You can't call dibs on a toilet. Whoa.. What are you talking about?  For what? Where was all this? I thought you guys said you didn't need school. Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle.  No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped!  Yeah, she isn't as hot in person. Hey, Craig, have you checked out the Internet lately?  Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers.  Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom.  Oh! Hey, Kyle!  Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun. Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you? You betcha, pal.  Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here.  Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun? The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.  All the cool kids are usin' it. Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.  Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid. Just hangin' out. What are you up to? I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.  Alright, alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff. They pay me to! Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.  People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it. How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves. I needed the money, alright?!  I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES! It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.  Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing. Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please? This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic. I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help. What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say "I have a problem." And you've gotta ask that higher power for help.  Fantastic girls' volleyball joke, Stan. Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags. Come on guys, let's go! You're... back?  Oh wow, I'm shocked. You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams". Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  "dripping in bitches"?! I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love!  Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot? So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes. You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it? Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people! Thought so.  Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off. You're so transparent, Stan. You wanna dance?  What the hell do you think you're doing? This is the girls' bathroom! ''What''?! Get ''out'' of here! Cartman is using our bathroom! Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is- That isn't fair! Hey guys.  How's it hanging'? It's cool. I'll wait. Yeah, I heard the girls' volleyball team won by like 20 points. Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.  Hi everybody. I love you! So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  So can you explain to our audience members ''over the age of five'' what it is that you DO? And why do you think young people-? ...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start? Awww, do we need Mackey here? He doesn't look any different to me. Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing. It's just the new diet fad!   Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please? I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore. Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go. Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face. Yes, thank you!  Get out of there! You gotta get out! Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard! There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce.  Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat. There's nothing left, I told you. A setup? But by who? Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.  Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girl's room! Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants. Actually,  it's more like a royal flush. Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?  What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now? All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls' volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words.  Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle. What the hell is that? What the hell? I don't- I don't even understand what's happening. Well, you have to admit he does look a little better. In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller? Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now. Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.  Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work? Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party? Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us. I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom! You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means! All right, well, if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?! Alright, listen, Eric! Listen, ''Eric''! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom! With the what?! But this isn't a hurt and confused child we're talking about. This is Eric Cartman. Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate? Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem. If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you!  Would that be agreeable to you? I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable- You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that? I thought you were a chick. Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom? And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in.  Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care. Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction. Eric, I am talking to YOU! Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay? I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing That's probably gluten, m'kay? Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems, See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off. Then eat it! If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay? Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off.  But then cisgender-ed is just normal Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office! All right, that was "Get This Party Started" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys? Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct? Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel? All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question? All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy! Next caller, what's your question? Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment? All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys? Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller. All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead. Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air. Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric? I actually have plans this weekend. That is correct, yes, I do.  Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop? Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!" Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight. People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say "Well there's fat in butter too," but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten? Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away.  Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein. Excuse me?   Hurry! You gotta go! Get out! You're not safe! Hurry! You gotta go!  Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys. Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way. No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up. Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here. Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad.  Download the app! It works great!  Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila. You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  Timmy! The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald. Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps! Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.   Butters? Butters, are you home?? What are you talkin' about? Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct. I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you. There, you see? It's right there.  I swear I didn't fly it. Butters? Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage? Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you. Yes, I'd like to return this drone.  Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore. Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it...  flies by itself.  The battery was half empty. Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about. You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything. No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision.   Randy. We need to talk. Inside.  Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast ''didn't recall doing''. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts? I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them. Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy?? If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby. Please do not adjust your televisions! My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us! Time to end this hobby once and for all!  No! NOOOO! We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "No more!" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away.  There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?! I know that! What do you-? Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh! What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer! Oh no, mister. You are GROUNDED!  Butters?! Who is that?!  Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember ''why'' Butters is grounded? What, what did he do? It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he ''is'' grounded.  And no bouncing the racquetball either!  Butters! What are your friends doing here?! You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?! Well, you're getting it now! Oh my gosh! Linda! It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore. No. I've I've got to tell him!  You can go outside and play, son. No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over. I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it? Yes! That's all gluten! Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having. It's in the Triscuits too, Randy! Don't forget the freezer! I don't know! Look at the ingredients! All right, that's all of it! I can get both of these, yeah!   Randy? Whose are these? Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans? Randy? Do you have something to tell me?  Randy? I was. Can you help me unload the car?   Randy? You just gonna drink beer alone all day? All right.  Oh no, I can't watch!  You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood. Wull whattaya mean? Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking. Stan, where are you going?  Randy?  Randy, what are you doing?! Randy, why are there drums playing?  Ohhh, no no nononononono no. I know. That's why you got kicked out of college. Stanley?? I don't know, Shelly. Sooo you're doing it?  Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic. You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.  Randy? What's going on? Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram? Yes! The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him. See if it started!  Randy, what about Shelly? How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you? RANDY?!  It's started. Randy, where are you going?! What are you doing?!? My farm! It was about yay big. , and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button. I mean, the, the drone. Yeah, that's what I saw. That that's all I saw. There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!  Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction? We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?  And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves? Oh shit! Yes? Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem. It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die! Who is this? The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure?  We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups. The pyramid down't work. We already tried it. What? Turn the pyramid upside down. Flip the damned food pyramid! It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT!  Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter. We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again. We're gonna get a better view of the stage. We're working as fast as we can, sir.  No. We believe now that that's poppycock. . Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers. Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in? Oh Jesus. We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on. Can we come in please? We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me. BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!! Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!  Don't limit me! You don't even understand me! Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour! Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the ''Women of Rock'' concert! Can I go with them?!  But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever!  She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself! That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything! So can I go or not?! Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys.  Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir. It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings.  How'd you get exposed?  Bagels? Gravy? We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain. Sir, the feds are here. Tom Vilsack? Michael Taylor, FDA. Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too! This is NOT FDA-approved!  This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go. I'm sorry, all right? Hello, Eric.  Come on over here, sugar. There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way. You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign. When you're stuck, look to the pyramids. They've got it wrong, child!  The world is upside down. Tell then they've got's it backwards!  They're just gonna let us starve to death? Well then, I guess I might as well eat!  There's plenty of pizza dough. I'm crazy hungry!  You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man! Maybe Papa John can help us! If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can-  It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves! Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something. Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde! Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved. You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the- Sir, we've got a match. Nutrition is stabilizing! We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir!  I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks. Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.  Awe, come on, lay off him guys. No, no, just he is.  What are you doing, Butters? What the hell is that?!   Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!  Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes! Wendy, just go with it!  Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I- ...Wendy? Yes? That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes. Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited. ...Sorry, I don't think I get your- From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something. No. Does it really matter? Are you guys parked over here? A Handicar? What's that? Wow... Lucky. Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up. Stephen, what are you doing? Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring! God help them all. Wow. Oh no! Ohh! There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley. It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV? All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days. Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I was hoping you could help me... make sense of somethin'. I understand you had a very large party in your back yard last... last Sunday, was it? I also understand that a very famous pop artist, Lorde, was the entertainment at that party. Well it, eh, it's just a little curious, you know? Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue? You understand, we deal with a lot of fake stories at Spin.  Was just wondering how the boys got someone like Lorde to play. You wouldn't know who?  Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady. It would be a shame if someone was... having fun at her expense. Peter Nelson?  Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I understand you work at the U.S. Geological Survey? I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde? Work with her? How?  How's that? The what? Yeah! Recess is almost over! Not while you're in here! Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side? You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.  but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us. How many times have you said "I think I've lost it" and everything turned out to be okay? Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me. Sit down, Ron.  Whattaya know about one of our artists, Lorde? Wrong.  She's a 45-year-old man in Colorado. He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference. He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do. You wanted to see me?  humble. What? Huh.  Holy shit. Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down. Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??  If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power! Stand by on camera 4. Boost the live Twitter feed. Aaand cue the hash tag! How are we trending?  We're trending at 64%, sir.  We're trending well? That's impossible. This isn't part of the holiday special! What is he doing?! We can't, sir! Yes? Yeah, that's right.  Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay? I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life. Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology. She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch.  Huh? Whoa, wait, is that? Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde. Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off. Amazing, yeah. Uh... Lorde... for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to... uh... find your own space... to go to the bathroom.   Lorde. My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with  It's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer Lorde. The singer went dark on Twitter claiming severe depression, and stating  "I realize now that I make people uncomfortable. I need to give this up and go back to just being the old me." Spin Magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week. Shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an on-duty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone, and worst of all, yes, the civilian drone was black.  While police claim they were only following standard protocol, the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil. The town of South Park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police. After police used excessive force at a peaceful protest, the town has now broken out into full-scale riots.  As the people of South Park continue to protest, the South Park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew. The governor has asked for help from the National Guard to bring order to the town. Sure. You bet.  Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you. Yes. Yes.  Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial. He's upstairs playing with all his friends. You don't use Handicar? Butters, why?? Oh my God! Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings. What is it, Stephen? He's not? Timmy!  Timmy.  Timmih!  Timmy.  Timmy!   Tutih Tuh-Timmih? Timmy!  Timmy! Timmy.  Tiiimmih Timmih. Timmih!  Timmih.  Hmmm, Timmih.  Timmy!  Timmih!  Timmih! Timmih...  Timmih! Timmih! Timmih! Timmih!  Ahh,  Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please? Agh! Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy? You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'? Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman? Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon? Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey? You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent. I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.  Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it. You don't like puke? No air conditioning. Too expensive.  Not enough people taking cab. Don't know what's wrong! What the fuck? Who does this handicapped boy think he is?! He's not even in union! Nobody takes jobs away from US! We need to speak to Mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business! Let's just say he'll be laid up a while. But we broke his legs. Both of them. We've got a big sales event going on, folks.  Hey guys. Can I get you in a 2014 Hummer? Rocktober sales event, guys.  Only a few more guitar licks left in Rocktober, guys. The fuck? Well I don't have any children. Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?  You've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here. What do you think? Huh? Can you see yourself in one of these puppies? No thanks. Oh, here's our Handicar. We're good. Shut up!  All right, kids, you know what time of year this is?  That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp? So far, Jimmy has raised $16! Francis has raised $29.32  And Timmy has raised $2,063.00! All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time!  Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year? All right. Well, just keep working on those donations.  A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp.   Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering. Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help. This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend. I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten. The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend. I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time. Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares.  El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve. Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend.  Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve. Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please? Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you? He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems. Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall. All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today? But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns? Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend?  Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve. Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future. Ohhh yes yes yes! That I ''can'' answer! His name was... But-ters! Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner? Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service. Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve. Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service. Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service. Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real. ...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono. My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.  Ohhh, fuck you! Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion? What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL! Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service! But you didn't answer any of my questions! Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service? Hello, hello my friend, are you still there? Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems. That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters! Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?! That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded!  Panasonic customer service. How can I help you? Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner? Yeeaahhh! Yeeaahhh!  I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp. We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks. Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast. Shh-shh.  Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr. Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past. His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good. Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all. Just ignore my friend. He's mentally disabled. Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake? No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake!  Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome.  Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem? Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what?? Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS! How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy? These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.  Shut up, Mimsyyyy! Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan. Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle. I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business. I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers. That's great. Summer camp, here we come.  Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole! It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers. It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.  So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick? Uh oh! Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy!  I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one! Shut up Mimsyyy! Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake? You are. Handicar.   Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?  We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla? Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours. Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp.  Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do. He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him.  Hey Mimsy.  That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet!  Goodnight, you son of a bitch!  Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat! Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!  Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime. Wait!  Wait, Mom? Can we talk? This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore. What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore! No! I don't wanna go to camp! No! That's not what I fucking said!  Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!  Oh! Aah! Mimsy! D'awww, we don't like camp, boss? D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark.  D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss? D'oh boy! Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace? Aw yeah, don't mind me. D'uh I don't know, boss. D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr. D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em? D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss? D'ah oh boy!  D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss. D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. Ah "I drove a Lincoln way before I got paid to drive one." Drrrr.  D'ah, it's an analogy.  D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss? D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel?  Shut up, Mimsy!  Yeah? D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!  from the mouths of the children of car salesmen! Aaand, because he's handicapped, he can use special access points and parking spaces. That kid was born with an unfair advantage! Hey wake up, you little scab! We got a message for ya! From the union.  Yeah, we sure did! Yeah. We snuck in his room last night and we... broke his legs! He's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient. Who is this rat?! Or maybe we can have the police shut him down! Who are you?! Right here is good.  Thank you. I can just use the app to tip you, right? Ohohh, this is so handy!  Thank you! Sure. Would you like to see mine? Timmy!  Timmy!  Today I am proud to announce the Tesla D, the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created. Any questions? What about it?! I am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing! The future of transportation is the electric cars, not wheelchairs! If there is a way to reduce Handicar's positive publicity, then we need to do it now!  And you! You say it's theoretically possible? Who's the sheepherder? Good day to you! Shut up, Mimsy!  But I though we wanted Handicar to lose the race! Aaaaaah! Yes, ahh, what about Handicar? Well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars. How do you intend to compete with this boy genius in Colorado?  Don't worry, Elon. Handicar is just a small company. So far the holiday special is trending fine, but it appears that the Michael Jackson hologram is the most heavily tweeted. Oh sure, operating in a few small towns, but when they start absorbing the taxi markets, bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world, driving your kids to and from school, delivering both people and things? Sir, I'm pretty sure that  "Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special" is not a good name. We can't compete with Handicar! It's just so damned handy! Who's the snake?  Timmy! Hey everyone, you need to see this!  What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!  of Wacky Races. The prime minister of Japan (Shinzo Abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. They also claim that if a race does take place, they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype Lexus into the conflict. The Canadians and Chinese are also saying they would be forced to race, and no one yet has heard from Dick Dastardly or Muttley. Unless a miracle happens, this Saturday morning the world will witness the fist Wacky Races in nearly 50 years. Wacky Races oh God! Wacky Races oh my God! Oh my God Wacky Races oh my God! No! I didn't get any! That guy has two!  That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal! There's none left, don't you understand?!  Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed! Oh okay, come on, ten dorrah, ten dorrah. Don't do the race. You don't have to prove anything.  He HAS to do it, don't you see? He has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible. There are hundreds of people with handicaps now. But isn't that the problem? I mean, let's face it, it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up. Anyone can have a Handicap now. I mean, even Matthew McConaughey is a Handicar driver now, for Chrit's sake! Hey.  I was drivin' a Handicar... way before I got paid to drive one. I just like how it feels.  I was drivin' a ZipCar... way before I got paid to drive one. Sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward. Are we drivin' cars or are cars... drivin' us? Mimsy!  Jesus. It's begun. God. Nice! Oh yeah!  It's a lot of natural. What do you mean? What's cock Magic? I don't go to any cock Magic fights! You are watching BBC World. The vioent conflict over transport is underway, and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember. We return you now to our live coverage of.. the Wacky Races. Not too close, Boopsie!  Ohohohh! Timmy! Timmy!  Timmy! All set for bed, honey? All right, goodnight.  Um... yes, o-of course.  I'm sorry, I can't understand you honey. You're handicapped. You want water? Is that what you want? Ohhh yes, okay honey, I'll turn off the lamp.  That he doesn't wanna go to summer camp this year, but I'll be damned if he's gonna ruin our Italy trip. What's he saying? Right. You've got a problem, Stotch! You ''know'' what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone! Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now! So, thuh so you flew it back here in time. Well, these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone!  How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that! It's okay honey, the- Oh for God's sakes!  That DOES IT! You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal! Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?! Help us with the drones spying on us!! It's okay, honey. Hi everyone. For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and un, just like you I'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood. Yes, well luckily nobody's watched the video of course.  Um... And and and that's the point. I mean, we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing, that that- Look, look, why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us, a neighborhood watch, to make sure that our community stays safe. You know, it used to be called "natural". Completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing. But now, because I "choose" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be, I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster! I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural! I haven't been "humiliated", I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?! I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop? Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird! They didn't! Hello, can I help you? You wanna return it? The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it?  Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.  Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it.  Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that? But they aren't illegal, Mr. Tucker. We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't- Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.  Who's the famous artist? You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon? I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown. Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day. All right, all right. We'll do everything we can. Or perhaps a forest ranger? Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh!  Please disperse. Candles on top of drones are a fire hazard,  Return to your garages. Yaaay! Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day! Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies? We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.  They see through the charade. I think they see through the charade, yes. Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up!  Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years, gaming was simple: you pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps, we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you ''pay'' for incentives, you're rewarded! It's a simple cycle, a never-ending loop based on RPGs: Explore -> Collect -> Spend -> Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money. And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles: entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-  -and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money. No no! It has to be just ''barely'' fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun.  Ehhhveryone is doing it. It's the way things are going! Oh. Ah what is the matter? Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that!  Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in "moderation"? Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time! Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game. Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games ''really'' work.  The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents. Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke. Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers. We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're COUNTING on it!! It's the same with us, but we've got our eyes on every addict's screen! Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats! Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil.  Where is the roof on this thing? Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming. Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free! Uh oh, you think so? I'm pretty sure they can hear us too.  Free"mium". The "<u>mium</u>" is Latin for "not really." It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun! So they'll forget they're spending money. Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each. You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game. But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan. Ohhhhh.  You what? Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot? Oh, what have I done?! My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, shitty tundra.   What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?! What's this? So this is- Everyone is doing this? Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.  Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing. We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford. You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?! You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine! But then all our profits come from people with problems. Who IS this guy?! Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil! Oh no! What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?! It's the dumbest game ever! All you do is collect and spend Canadough! But it's ''not'' free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free! We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun? It's just the way things are going? It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect.  Do you really think that would help? But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!  Okay, but we still won't stand for this! Oh God, he just doesn't stop! Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in ''Devil's Advocate''?! Beelzeboot! Who the fuck is that? What do you mean? Aw, I don't know.  Ah, go away. What are you talkin' about? It's fun. Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!  Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop. Well okay, good idea.  Hey, buddy. Come on, guy.  Enjoy your Canadough. *Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough? You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?! Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul!  So you got dopamine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce. But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff. Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopamine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life. Yeah, that's pretty much what it means. Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time? Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec. So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopamine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff. Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ? You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too, so people have free will and all that shit. But ,you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay. What's this? What, you just collect coins? No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out? Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, "temptation has to be nuanced!" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright? Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance! Return from whence you came!  Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come.  You discovered my plan, but too late!  Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me! Heheheh! Hahaha!   Heh heheheh, I stab you.  Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan!  Ow! Watch it, guy!  Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil. The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world.  Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton.  Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years. Screw that, go Canada!  What the hell are you doing, kid?! Hey!  What you doin' motherfucker?! You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch. No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine. Try and relax, and when your parents get here we'll sort this all out.  Everything okay in here? O-kay.  Eric? Poopsiekins?  Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call? Sir, I'm gonna have to connect you to Customer Service. Hang on a sec.   Hope you can make it. The girls' volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on. What's wrong with supporting girls' athletics?!  You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is "We're too busy." What fight? Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my Elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on. I am attacking, but with a newly summoned Spark Ghast who has Trample. Four damage to your planeswalker. I can block that with Uprooted Minotaur.  Nnoohhh! Quiet in the peanut gallery, please. Serendib Sorcerer unblocked. Winner: McCormick! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Yeeahhh! Hey! Pssst!  You guys like hard-core stuff, huh? Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit. Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here.  And you might wanna pack a barf bag.  You purice? Okay, come on, come on, five dorrah, five dorrah each! Come on, five dorrah! You go down! Go down, find seat! We in sixth fight! Gogogogogogogo!  Whoa! Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us? Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it. Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held? Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong, and anyone I find involved with this filth is goin' down! Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that?  Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using? Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report? Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?! Agreed! Who first called 911?  Freeze!  Especially you, scumbag! We saw your fliers.  "Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm." I'll volunteer. I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police. Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers? You're Lorde.  What is it, Adams? Did you choke him? Did you shoot him? So what's the problem? Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black?? He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious! That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy! As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay. Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him? Heh, uh huh?   Start over: what's the setup? Oh, it's a new one.  Shoot him!  All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do! We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're working on it! What?! We're not racists.  Uh huh, go ahead. Yehah? Hang on! Mitch!  Okay, go ahead.  Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead. Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on.  Okay, go ahead. Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop! What is it?! Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.  We only deal in the highest quality poultry Planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed? Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks. Do I think they're happy?  They're fuckin' chickens. Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards. That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers. I think I'll bet on the next one.  Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock. I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time? Oh, yes. And I'm not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I'm talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here's the address.  Let's see what kind of money your cock can really make. Alright, your rooster's up next, boys. He doesn't have a choice. What do you think all these people are here to see? The hell you do! Get your cock in there!  Lousy cops! How did you find us? We didn't put those fliers out! Yay, a show, a show! I hate you! Yeah, yay!  They're getting a kick out the magician, huh? And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh. Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there. Who? There weren't any "decks." Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it! Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I ''told'' you them homies didn't cap his ass!   Mommy! Grandpa! For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky. That's Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds.  He's never lost a fight. Hell, he's never even lost one health!  You're watching ESPN Illegal, your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic. And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move.  A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH, and he's just laid down Life's Legacy! That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest! Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this! <poem><i>Come on Barbie, let's go party.</i></poem>  Ewww!   Aww, look at all the bright colors. How's it goin' bros? My name's <sup>PewDiePie</sup>. I'm playing ''Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare''. Here we go.  Agh! People are shooting at me, bros! There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN! Alright, I hope that's enough. Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig!   He's just laying there. I'm going "Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun." Oh my God I killed him! Oh my God, that's the ugliest... ...that's the lamest... How's it goin' bros? This is <sup>PewDiePie</sup>! Thanks for all the shoutouts. I guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out.  God damn it, get out of here! This show is getting kind of boring, bros. What do you say we change it out to something more exciting? I know! Let's play ''Call of Duty''!  Ohhh yeah! This is more like it, bros! Okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. Let's get rid of him! Oh yeah! Way better, bros! This is how we do it in Sweden! BOOM head shot! BOOM head shot! ...Meh.  Maybe later, 'kay?  PewDiePie! Meh. <sup>CartmaaanBrah</sup>! Yeah! Hee hee! Hee hee.  Hee hee.  I'm free! I'm free! Hee hee. Dah dadit dat ja!  Hee hee! Yes. No, I just need to... take care of some im-, important business. Yes. I mean, yes, that's all. I'm, I'm just gonna fish and hunt.  Nobody! That's ignorant! Allegedly! Allegedly! That's ignorant! ...That's ignorant. I'm just cold. Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant! Oh I will. Trust me, I will.  Come on, this is a great lineup. I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig. I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada. I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush.  You're nervous, it's understandable. You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit. Alright that's enough!  Look at yourselves! What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em! We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back! What is Project Alpha? What is that? Sit down, Lorde.  The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level. On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about. Who said anything about you?  Today, commentary IS the content. And you, I'm afraid, are just in the way.  It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all? Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level. And we still have no idea where the damned hologram is? We got one shot at this, people! This  has to be the holiday special to end all holiday specials! He's got his finger on the pulse of young America. People, you know what we're trying to do here.  We're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. That means being hip, being now. There, you see that? "Blumpkin catchers." Do any of you even know what that means? This kid is our way to connect with the youth of America, and I'm gonna give him all the power he needs. Excellent. I'm just about to deal with our last order of business now. No no, thank you!  It's me. I've got somethin' you might be interested in. I've got your son here, Lorde. If you don't cooperate, he dies. It was five years ago that I... became a grandpa. At first it was wonderful. I wanted to show my grandson everything. Teach him all about the entertainment business. One day I aasked him, "Who's your favorite celebrity?" You know what he said to me? He said, "PeewwDiePie." I had no idea who   I AM NOT A GRANDPAAA! Damn it, you're ruining the show!  Shut him down! This is not what I hired you for! I CONTROL TALENT, DAMNIT! This is crazy and everyone is watching everything! All I wanted was to play one level of ''Call of Duty'' and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people. I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l- All I wanted was to play one level of ''Call of Duty'' and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people. But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity? I don't get it. The whole fun of ''Call of Duty'' is that you get to do the shooting. I don't get it. The whole fun of ''Call of Duty'' is that you get to do the shooting. (Commentary?) Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on ''Call Of Duty''. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on ''Call Of Duty'', so let's start. That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about ''Call Of Duty'' to Stan.  Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what. God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? <sup>CartmaaanBrah</sup>! Alright guys, uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde.  Have a great show, ladies. Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone! That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?! 'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse! You're an internet bullshit artist, Lorde!  PewDiePie! CartmanBrah! <sup>PewDiePie</sup>! Okay Grandpa, we'll be sure to keep that in mind.  They really just don't get it. There's nothing sadder than a old man crying. Yeah, someone can come change all this. You know who. Of course! We just need to get everyone to believe in him. He'll always come and help. #webelieveinyou Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember? It's best to just make old people think they matter. No sir. Thank goodness we have you to do that.  Old people are so funny. Okay. It's the holiday season. We just need to get everyone to believe again. And, cue the hologram!  Oh Lorde, you're such a purist. Thanks for loving me. I love you too. And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE! Stop him.  Michael Jackson's hologram is on the loose! Ogh! Lorde, ewww! Ah, we've lost any ability to track the hologram's location. Ih...it looks like it reprogrammed its guidance systems. Sir, are you sure that we wanna-? Project Alpha? Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha! Bring it up!  Tupac. Godspeed, Tupac. Yes. That might be our only option. The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-  I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit. Oh! There he is comin' down the stairs. Hello, son. Your savethelivingroom hash tag is getting a lot of attention and we think it's great. I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend.  It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now. Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours. Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly! This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son! Happy Holidays!   Detective Harris! Sir! We've got a problem!  We've arrested a black man who was snooping around the old Jefferson estate! Yes! YES! He... appears to be just a hologram, sir.  Naw, it's ignorant! You don't understand! We have to stop them! Heee hee!  I'm flying! Hee dah dada dat dih Who? Lorde? You're not Lorde, that's ignorant. They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant! It's gonna be the most ignorant holiday special ever! It's directed at children! We have to stop them! Yes. We have to reach the children. It's our only hope.  It's ignorant. He's here to kill us! Run!! Heee heee!  Shelly? Who's Shelly? That's ignorant.  There he is! That's the ignorant man! We believe in you. Of course! What about this, sir? Burnt sienna? Huh how about we say he's mixed race? It's a black guy! Choke him! Shoot him and then choke him!  And they smell like soap. Maybe we should help Careful Grandpa, you might crap your Depends!  Oh, I feel bad for the little guy. Can I help you?  Sir? A black guy walked into the police station! Well a, a black guy walked into the police station. There's this black guy, walked into the police station. No, really, a black guy walked into the-! No no, a black guy literally walked into the police station! Oh yeah, I think I've heard it, but go ahead. Ohhh ya ya ya? "We set who free?" Trending at 64% and steady. We're barely trending at all. But #ihatecartmanbrah is trending off the charts!  There's something new trending! #copscantgoaroundchokingblackpeople. No, sir, I I think they mean we shouldn't. Like we're racist or something. Sir, we've got confirmation. There's two black guys in the upstairs of the house! Two black guys. One of them is threatening the other one. So, then, the first black guy said to the second black guy, "Don't shoot me. I'm on your side." And then the, the the tattooed black guy said, to him, "I ain't gonna kill you, man. You're the King of Pop. Let's go cap that whitey producer." <poem><i>Have a jolly holly Christmas</i></poem> <poem><i>It's the best time of the pfffffffft.</i></poem> <poem><i>Pfffffffft</i></poem> It's incredible!
