Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things. I'm watching one of Stanley's ''Chinpokomon'' video tapes. Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values.  I don't know what the hell they're talking about. This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what? Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff! No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what ''Battle of the Network Stars'' did to an entire generation. We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel. You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.  My son hasn't made any sense in days. So, what are we going to do about our children?  Ahhh, hello-o? Of course! That's a great idea! Stan? Stan, it's Mommy!  Stanley--  --you need to come home right now. Mommy misses you. Stanley, I'm talking to you!  Stan, please, come home! No, it's not okay! What? Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis! Oh!   Come on! We don't have much time!  That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  You bet, Stanley!
