Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl! We came over to cheer you up, Stan! Well what do we do now? What's Raisins? This place is awesome! Whoa!  W-we are. You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that? Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go. When do you ''wanna'' see me? Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars.    She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!  I waited all night for you to get off work. I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you. Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present. It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit.   hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime. O-kay! Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship. Hi! Is Lexus here? Darling!  Oh God. I missed you so much.  Hey Lexus. Wuh it's me, Butters. I'm fine. I miss you though.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going? Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch ''The Exorcist'' on DVD. Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times. Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God. Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again. Uh but I spent it all. On my girlfriend.  Yeah. Yup! Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you. Okay.  Here we are, Mom and Dad!  Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her. Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus!  Mom? Dad? This is Lexus. Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus. Huh? Oh, I see.  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint! ... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore? So that's it? We're broken up now? Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over. Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.  Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me. Yeah.  It sure does hurt. Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life. Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid... Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan.
