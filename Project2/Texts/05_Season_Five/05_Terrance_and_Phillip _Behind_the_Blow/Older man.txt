Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town. Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night.  You... what?? And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?  You don't ''need'' to see Terrance and Phillip.  Their will is strong. Very well, kids; we'll work on getting the event ready here, and ''you'' go get Terrance and Phillip.  But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.  Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work! That's not true.  The Republicans are responsible.  Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule.  You what? You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else! Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements.   Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up.  Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event.
