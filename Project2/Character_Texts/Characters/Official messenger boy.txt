Worthy young lad, are you all right? This year? Why it's 1776, it is. Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's house to get a very important document, I am. Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North? A flashback? Why, what is that? Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.  I'm afraid you'll have to wait here. Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
