I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.    I've gone and made a metal newspaper! Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. ''Ohhh'', lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position! You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town.   Your very own metal fuzzy dice. Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?  Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.  Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip.  The same. Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir. Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but- That's great news!  I am, sir.  A young gentleman! Of great expectations! Pip? Pip, old chap?  That's right. You're safe and warm now. Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you.  'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman! What's that, Pip. Yeah!   Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!   Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!  You did it, Pip!  Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?
