Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA. What does it mean? Oh, fudge! Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again. It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria! Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards! What the-?! Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your... What the hell are ''you'' supposed to be anyway? No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything. Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good.

Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us!

Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
