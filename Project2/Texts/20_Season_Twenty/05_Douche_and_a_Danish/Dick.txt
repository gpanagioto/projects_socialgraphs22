Fellow trolls, we have gathered together because our anonymity is being threatened. Individually, we are some of the most notorious trolls in Colorado. We must now find a way to unite. Each one of us has the power to make message boards go haywire, The power to make individuals buckle and fall. Imagine if we use those skills against a common enemy. And we... have Skankhunt42. I believe that he... is the key to stopping all this. You were saying, Skankhunt? If we all worked with you, Skank, could we do it? Could we troll an entire country? Hello.  I gotta hand it to you, Gerald. You have a really nice home, nice family. And who is that? I've studied your work. You're so good at lashing out at the system. Bringing people down off their high horses. Why do you do it? I don't believe that. I think there's more to Skankhunt. When I was in school, kids teased me. Called me "midget," even though I'm not. My mother was a little person, but she actually married a guy who had gigantism syndrome. She thought, if she was a little person and had a baby with a giant, I would come out normal.  We can't let these Danish pricks take our online lives, Skank. For some of us... it's all we have. Test test 1 2. This is Dildo Shwaggins. We are ready to commence the trashing of Denmark. All trolls report in. Okay. everyone follow Skankhunt's lead. Don't get distracted, we are only trolling Denmark. It's started!  Don't know, but Google has it as the number one story. We did it! We did it!  The Guardian has a bunch of stories up about how the Denmark government isn't responding to even interview requests.
