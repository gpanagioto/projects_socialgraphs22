Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back. Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either.  And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here.  Oh yeah, a fax!! It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax! Oh! it says, "The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it." We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live! It's back? It's back!
