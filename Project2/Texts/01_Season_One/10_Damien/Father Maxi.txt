Look! It's that guy from the public access show! When is Satan gonna show up? You're gonna ''kick his ass'', Jesus. Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck. You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted! Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus. Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now! ''Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light!'' See ya later. What the hell, does he think we're all crazy? I don't believe this!
