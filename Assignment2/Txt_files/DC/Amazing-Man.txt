==Publication history==
Although a 1980s creation of writer [[Roy Thomas]], the Amazing-Man published by [[DC Comics]] was placed in the 1940s and made a contemporary of various [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] superheroes. The character was created by Roy Thomas as a tribute to [[Bill Everett]]'s [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|Amazing-Man]], a character he created for [[Centaur Publications]] during the so-called [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref>{{Google books|aXqPtKhc4IMC|The All-Star Companion|page=76|keywords=amazing+man|text=|plainurl=}}</REF>

==Fictional character biography==
===Will Everett===
Will Everett was a promising young [[African-American]] [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] who had competed in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], but his post-Olympic career devolved into a janitorial profession at a laboratory owned by [[Cyclotron (comics)|Dr. Terry Curtis]]. During an accident involving the explosion of some equipment to which he was exposed (developed by the criminal mastermind the [[Ultra-Humanite]]), Everett quickly developed the ability to mimic whatever properties he touched (similar to [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Absorbing Man]]). For example, if he touched [[steel]], then his body became composed of steel.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Amazing Man I | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 12 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>

====All-Star Squadron====
{{main|All-Star Squadron}}
At first, he was employed by the Ultra-Humanite as a henchman along with Curtis (as Cyclotron) and [[Deathbolt]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = #23|Date = July 1983|Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref> However, his sympathies soon swayed towards the side of good<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = #25|Date = September 1983|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> after repeated exposure to the [[All-Star Squadron]], a team of both Golden Age characters and retroactive characters like himself, with whom he joined to defeat his former employer's machinations. He then served a lengthy stint as a member of this voluminous mystery man organization.

In February 1942, the Squadron helped Everett defeat the bigoted villain in his home town of [[Detroit]], the Real American.<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = #38|Date = October 1984|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> During the first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]], Amazing-Man was one of a group of heroes chosen by the Monitor to stop the Anti-Monitor's quest for destruction.<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = #53|Date = January 1986|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|Title = Crisis on Infinite Earths|Issue = #5|Date = August 1985|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> On a future case, Amazing-Man's powers changed so that now he had mastery of [[magnetism]] while losing his ability to mimic matter.

====Civil Rights Activist====
In the 1950s, his secret identity was revealed to the general public by [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. This act endangered the lives of Everett's wife and family. During the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s, the murder of his nephew alongside two other civil rights activists spurred his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement of the time. He led marches against segregation across the United States, and also helped to quell riots in [[Detroit]]. Everett was also responsible for the capture of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s murderer, [[James Earl Ray]]. In the DC Comics Universe, he is considered the third most important advocate for [[African American]] civil rights, behind only King and [[Malcolm X]].<ref name=jsa12>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #12 (March 2008)</ref>

====Heirs====
It was later revealed that his grandson, Will Everett III (a.k.a. "Junior") also developed mimicry abilities. Will Everett Senior was last seen in the hospital, visited by his grandson Will Everett III. The senior Everett was dying of cancer.<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = Justice League America|Issue = #86-87|Date = March - April 1994|Publisher = DC Comics}}, ''DC Comics Encyclopedia''</ref> The status of his son, the father of Amazing-Man III, is currently unknown. For a brief time, his grandson carried on the legacy of Amazing-Man before dying tragically. Later, another grandson named Markus Clay would take up the mantle of Amazing-Man.

===Will Everett III===
[[Image:ExtremeJustice 16.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Will Everett III and [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]], artist Tom Morgan.]]
Will Everett III carried on his grandfather's heroic tradition, joining the [[Justice League]] at [[Wonder Woman]]'s request.<ref name="dc-ency2">{{Cite book | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Amazing Man II | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 12 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|Title = Justice League America|Issue = #86|Date = March 1994|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> As a member, he was instrumental in defeating the [[Overmaster]] alongside the other members of the League and reformed members of the [[Cadre (comics)#Cadre of the Immortal|Cadre of the Immortal]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = Justice League International|Volume = 2|Issue = #66|Date = July 1994|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Soon after this, [[Captain Atom]] formed a splinter group of the JLA nicknamed [[Extreme Justice]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = Extreme Justice|Issue = #0|Date = January 1995|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=252}}</ref> He remained with this team until its end.<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = Extreme Justice|Issue = #0|Date = July 1996|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref name="dc-extr">{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 117 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Later, Will joined the [[Crimson Fox]]'s unofficial re-grouping of Justice League Europe. In their single ill-fated adventure, Will was apparently killed by a supervillainess named the [[Mist (comics)|Mist]], along with the Crimson Fox and [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]. In Amazing-Man's case, Mist tricked him into mimicking glass and then shattered him. The status of his father Will Everett II is unknown, but his cousin Markus Clay is the new Amazing-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|Title = Starman|Volume=2|Issue = #38|Date = January 1998|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Jan08/solicitations.html Newsarama.com: DC COMICS SOLICITATIONS FOR JANUARY 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027110626/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Jan08/solicitations.html |date=2007-10-27}}</ref>

During the events of ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Will was briefly resurrected by the effects of [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s tampering with reality. He was shown fighting the [[Absorbing Man]], an enemy of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

Years later during ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', Will is memorialized by [[Martian Manhunter]] with a statue in [[Happy Harbor]] alongside other fallen Justice League members.

===Markus Clay===
The third Amazing-Man is a man named Markus Clay, who operates out of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He is Will Everett's other grandson, and the cousin of Will Everett III. Markus is currently helping survivors of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=jsa12/> A recent recruit of the [[Justice Society of America]], he has helped the team communicate with [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]]. After Gog's defeat, Markus returns to New Orleans, considering forming a team of his own.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #23</ref>

Despite having resigned from the JSA, Markus is seen attending [[Damage (DC comics)|Damage]]'s funeral following his death during ''[[Blackest Night]]''.<ref>''JSA: All-Stars'' #7</ref>

===The New 52===
A new Amazing-Man appears following the events of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', where among other changes, the JSA has been removed from the history of Prime Earth. The new Amazing-Man is revealed to be Rocker Bonn, a former [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] agent who was given metahuman abilities by [[Project Cadmus]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=11}}</ref> After going into hiding in Texas, Bonn is attacked by Kevin Kho, the new [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]]. Bonn is defeated by Kho and subsequently absorbed by [[Brother Eye]], who states that he may prove useful at a later date.<ref>''OMAC'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
* Will Everett was originally capable of transforming himself into a living, breathing facsimile of any material that he touched. Later Will Everett's powers were altered, and he was instead able to magnetically attract or repel objects with his hands.
* Will Everett III could cause his body to duplicate the properties of any inorganic material he touched from stone to glass. If he touched the pavement, for example, he became a sentient being made of living stone, with all its commensurate strengths and weaknesses. Will Everett III could also absorb and duplicate vast amounts of energy, as when he defeated the Overmaster by draining and duplicating its powers.
* Markus Clay appears to possess the same abilities as the first two Amazing-Men.

==In other media==
In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode "Power Outage", Will Everett is mentioned as one of the people who seemingly died as a result of the particle accelerator accident that gave The Flash his powers.

In season 4 of ''[[Young Justice: Phantoms|Young Justice]]'', Will Everett as the Amazing-Man is mentioned by the assassin [[List of DC Comics characters: O|Onyx]] as her superhero maternal grandfather. In the episode "I Know Why the Caged Cat Sings", Everett was extremely moral which Onyx felt she could never live up to his standards, which is why Onyx ran away from home. He died a few years prior to the episode.
