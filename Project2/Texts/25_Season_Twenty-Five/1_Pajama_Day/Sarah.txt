I'm sorry, sir, but we aren't seating anyone who isn't wearing their pajamas. I understand, but the management prefers that everyone inside be nice and comfy womfy. Sir, I'm just the hostess here. If you prefer, you only need to wear your pajamas to get in. You don't have to wear them at your table while you're actively eating.
