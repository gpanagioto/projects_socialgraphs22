All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary. And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds!   All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious." Closely attentive to details. Careful. Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious. Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Eric, your word is "chair." Something you sit on. English!  Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!! All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school.  Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral. Having to do with a lake or ocean. Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.  Correct! Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic. Krocsyldiphithic. Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality. Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell. Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.
