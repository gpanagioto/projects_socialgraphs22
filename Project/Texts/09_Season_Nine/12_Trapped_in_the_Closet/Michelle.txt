Oho good, you're going to be so happy. Great, so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars.  Mr. Hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called "body thetans." Yes! And being the genius that he was, Mr. Hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans.  This is called an E-meter. It's the main tool of Scientology. You just grab a hold of these handles as I talk you through past experiences in your life. I'll be taking readings here, and we'll be able to determine your thetan levels. Come on in the auditing room and I'll show you how it works.  Just take a few deep breaths, and I'll just get a base reading of your thetan levels.  Huh, that's, that's strange. Somethin-,  something's wrong. Brian, could you come over here a second? Will you... look at his thetan levels?
