Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers? You're Lorde.  What is it, Adams? Did you choke him? Did you shoot him? So what's the problem? Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black?? He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious! That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy! As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay. Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him? Heh, uh huh?   Start over: what's the setup? Oh, it's a new one.  Shoot him!  All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do! We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're working on it! What?! We're not racists.  Uh huh, go ahead. Yehah? Hang on! Mitch!  Okay, go ahead.  Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead. Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on.  Okay, go ahead. Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!
