''Oh'', well, there's a news flash! Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay? Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric? Well-obviously ''something'' is bothering him.  Oh, of course! My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay? Oh, hell yes!
