 <poem>''Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.''</poem> <poem>''Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!''</poem>  My name's Butters. Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh, even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger." Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.  Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.  I'm sorry.  Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton. Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw.  Oh hamburgers!  Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money?? Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast! <poem>''You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.''</poem>  Well, no, not quite.  Before ''what'' happens?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!     I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
