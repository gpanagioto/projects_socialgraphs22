Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.  No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very ''artistic'' things.. Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts! Come on, everybody, let's go.  Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley. Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania.  Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again. Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow.  There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....? What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer. Poor dear must be tired. I don't know how to tell. ''You'' tell them.  Randy!  Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay. Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this.  Well, I… think we… have to,… don't we?  We'll have to call the police and see what ''they'' want us to do.   Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal. Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania. Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone! You ruined my house!
