Larry and Brad Stoltsky Those XBox Ones are as good as ours! Yeah. Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system. If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.  No, the XBox's are gonna be better. No! We can't divide like this!  You're on our side, right?  Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.  Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday. I know. I don't know. This isn't helping us, Butters! Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
