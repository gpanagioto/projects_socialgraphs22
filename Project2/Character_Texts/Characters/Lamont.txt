I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire!  Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of Bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.  Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe.  That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up. Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and Hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point? Good. Now put the gun in your mouth. Hey! You're following plankers and Tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT!  I will be right back.  Yes, what is this about?  Another species? What are you talking about? They're evolving. Cats are evolving.  There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.   What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire?  Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want? You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
