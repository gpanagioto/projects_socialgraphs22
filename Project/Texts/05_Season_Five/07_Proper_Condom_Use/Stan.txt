Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?  Mom! Dad! You gotta see this! But it's super-cool! Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.  Red rocket, red rocket! I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket.  My room? Why? No! Why?! What's the big deal?! I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out. Huh?? What things?? No! Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey? It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'. Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get- You guys, we just wanna know- Why? ...A what? Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.  But Wendy, we don't understand how that- Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick. Yeah, we need condoms! Why does ''that'' matter? Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side. Doesn't it give any other directions? Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo! How do you feel? Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on. Man, this condom's driving me crazy. From sex?? All this time... It's the ''girls'' that give ''us'' diseases!  Yeah, come on guys, this is war!  Ha! They're ''your'' diseases! That does it! Attack!  We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases. But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex? Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
