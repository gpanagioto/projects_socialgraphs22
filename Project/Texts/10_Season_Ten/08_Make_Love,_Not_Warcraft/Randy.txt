 Stan? Stan!  You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?  Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together. No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  What?? Why?? Why?! Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys?  Yeah, I'm playing from the office. Yes? That's my son's character's name in Warcraft. Who are you?  Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?! Where?! Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him! Give me the sword. I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online. Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Where's your car? Dammit, mine's in the shop!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON! World of Warcraft! I need to play! Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in!  Staaan!  Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana. No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another? Okay.  Augh! Stan...   I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.  Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
