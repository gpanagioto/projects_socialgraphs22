Presidential election is only two weeks away. We have to  destroy these things. Try the acid. We have to keep trying.  Where did they go? No, I'll go find more.  Then how do we stop them from getting me elected President?  Nothing matters! Well that's just impossible.  Don't you get it, Randy? I'm not a politician. I never was. Oooh geeeeez! My fellow Americans, we live in an un-presented time of uncertainty. I want to speak to you human-to-human because with God's grace, this will be the last time you ever hear from me. When I started this campaign I was saying a lot of shit because I was angry,  There is only one thing that matters now. On November eighth, you must vote against me, and show the world that you didn't think the new ''Star Wars'' was all that good. When you're in that voting booth, remember that every vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote that shows the world we agree that ''The Force Awakens'' was more like a happy day reunion's special than a movie. The choice is yours, America. Please make the right one.
