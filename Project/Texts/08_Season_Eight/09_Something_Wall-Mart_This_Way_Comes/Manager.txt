People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart!  I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change...   Fools. Ignorant fools. Come in?  Oh hello, fine shoppers.  What? What, you think ''I'' want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave. Oh, you're wrong!  Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're ''working'' at the Wall-Mart because ''it'' has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.  Not so loud! It can hear you. Aah!
