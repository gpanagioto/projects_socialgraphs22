Ah, dammit! My Goddamn little brother's trying to follow me to school, again! No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo! Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby! Kick the baby! Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. Really? What about? Totally! Yeah. This ''does'' seem really familiar. Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream? You don't? Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car.   And then ''you'' said... Weird Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day. What is a proc-tologist, Chef? What a dick! Other than his monstrous size. And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it. Are you okay? What!? No way!  You do it, Kenny! I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt! God-damnit Cartman! Stop it Cartman! God Dammit! That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it! No! You're lying! That does it! CHARGE!  It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff. We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth? Candy bars? Aaaah! Runrunruuun!    I think we ditched them.  What the? Where are, where are we? It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship. Yeah. Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay. No!  Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover? Earth? You mean that you aliens actually ''enjoy'' sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up. What?? Who canceled us? Dude, we have to try! Mighty, powerful network executives, we have come in a great distance in order to have--  Please don't cancel us. Please. Oh my God, this is great! Kenny!  The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show. And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons. Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. What the hell is that?
