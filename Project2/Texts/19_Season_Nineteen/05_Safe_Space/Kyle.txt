Uh huh. Yeah probably. Wait, what? You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp account and only give him the good comments? No. If he doesn't like what people say on Twitter, he can get off.   Give me... give me detention. Yeah, I'll take the detention. There's more than two people on the Internet.  Dude, Butters, you're seeing things! Sifting through all the horrible stuff people say on the Internet is making you lose it! Butters, listen to my voice. Then stop, dude! Butters, all this isn't worth it. Just. Take, the detention, dude.
