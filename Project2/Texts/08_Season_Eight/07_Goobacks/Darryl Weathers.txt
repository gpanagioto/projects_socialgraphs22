 Thanks for having me, Bill. You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans!  They took our jobs! Those jobs belong to people from the present!  They took our jobs!! Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman.  "Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane." So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening! All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening?  How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?! Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like? Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs! Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs! Hey, yeah. Well that's not a bad idea! Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs! You ''have'' to, Jimbo, or else we won't be able to stop them! They took 'r jaobs!   Everyone who believes in America, join in with us! We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent! Yeah America!  The immigrants are fadin' away! Back in the pile everyone!
