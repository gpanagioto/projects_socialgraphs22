Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole? In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa.  Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away. O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you- Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa? What?! What has happened? Speak!  I knew one day it would come to this. The haoles are trying to do away with us. I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island!    Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome! It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you. Are all the tourists gone from our island? Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now.
