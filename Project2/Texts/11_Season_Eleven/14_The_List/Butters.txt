 Fellas! Fellas! It's- Oh my god! You're not gonna believe this! Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest. I dunno. I don't know. I-it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them.  You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.  Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.  Neat-o!  Okay!  They sure don't. You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?  Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is! Whoopie!
