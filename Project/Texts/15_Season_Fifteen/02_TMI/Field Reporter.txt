Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago. What exactly are you angry about? You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands? Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
