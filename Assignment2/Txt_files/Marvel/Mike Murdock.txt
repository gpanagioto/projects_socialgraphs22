'''Michael Dean Murdock''' (born April 18, 1946) is an American [[Contemporary Christian]] singer-songwriter, [[televangelist]] and pastor of The Wisdom Center ministry based in [[Haltom City, Texas]]. Murdock preaches around the world and is best known for his promotion of [[prosperity theology]]. He hosts the ''School of Wisdom with Mike Murdock'' television program.

==Life and work==
Murdock was born in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], to J.E. and Willie Murdock, and has four sisters. In 1964, Murdock graduated from [[LaGrange High School (Louisiana)|LaGrange High School]] in Lake Charles.<ref name="Hype"/> He attended [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University]] in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], but left after three semesters in 1966.<ref name="Hype">Darren Barbee, "Behind the Hype: Mike Murdock exaggerates his accomplishments and cites dubious statistics," ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'', March 4, 2003</ref> 

The ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' reported that he had registered 76 songs with the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], according to unofficial data kept on those groups' web sites.<ref name="Hype"/>

In 1989, as a pastor on [[The PTL Club]], Murdock gained national attention during the PTL scandal when he asked viewers to donate to [[Jim Bakker]] and [[Tammy Faye Bakker]] claiming they helped broken marriages and people.<ref>"Bakkers Ask for $1 Million Defense Fund," ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', 8 Aug 1989</ref><ref>"Jim, Tammy Bakker Return To Television," ''[[Harlan Daily Enterprise]], 3 Jan 1989</ref> The PTL later declared bankruptcy and Bakker went to prison for fraud related to his ministry.

During a sermon, Murdock bragged about buying a jet with cash, lambasting his congregation for being jealous and telling them to "act happy" for him. This was shown on an episode of ''Last Week Tonight'' and used by [[John Oliver]] to highlight the extravagant lifestyles of many televangelists.

In 1999, the ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' reported Murdock refused interview requests and had previously declined to answer questions about money.<ref>"Ministry's practices questioned," ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', 10 Jan 1999</ref> 

In 2003, the ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' ran a series about Murdock giving association (donor-raised) money to select family members who were on his association's board.<ref name="Money2Relatives">Ministry gives money to Murdock’s relatives," ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'', March 3, 2003 | {{cite web |url=http://www.trinityfi.org/press/murdock01.html |title=PROFIT in the pulpit (Mike Murdock) |accessdate=2009-11-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017115911/http://www.trinityfi.org/press/murdock01.html |archivedate=2009-10-17 }}</ref>

On March 3, 2003, the Associated Press reported Murdock asked followers for money to help the poor but spent more than 60% of donations on overhead, including his salary, and only a tiny amount (reported to be "legal minimums of 1% to 3%") on helping the needy, or any other 'public interest'.<ref name="Money2Self">[http://www.twcnews.com/archives/tx/austin/2003/03/02/evangelist-spends-most-chairitable-donations-on-himself-TX_63283.old.htm] {{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 2004, the ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' reported Murdock "has started a church and the law allows him to keep his financial records behind closed doors." In August 2004, the association purchased the International Faith Center in Haltom City, Texas, and changed its name to The Wisdom Center, which it operates as a church.<ref name="MovesBooks">"Televangelist Mike Murdock moves financial books behind closed doors," ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram,'' Dec. 15, 2004 | {{cite web |url=http://trinityfi.org/press/murdock04.html |title=Televangelist Mike Murdock moves financial books behind closed doors |accessdate=2015-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015057/http://trinityfi.org/press/murdock04.html |archivedate=2015-08-24 }}</ref>

On March 22, 2012, the ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' reported that Murdock's home, assessed at $1.5 million, was for sale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.star-telegram.com/investigations/2012/03/haltom-city-televangelist-mike-murdocks-15-million-mansion-up-for-sale.html|title=Poverty-hating Haltom City televangelist Murdock's $1.5 million mansion for sale - Watchdog Bytes|website=blogs.star-telegram.com|access-date=2016-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919044419/http://blogs.star-telegram.com/investigations/2012/03/haltom-city-televangelist-mike-murdocks-15-million-mansion-up-for-sale.html|archive-date=2016-09-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 9,943 sq ft 25-room home located on 6.89 acres was first listed for sale on [[Realtor.com]] on November 29, 2011 for $3.2 million and then subsequently on September 4, 2013 for $2.7 million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/2010-Whitebridge-Rd_Argyle_TX_76226_M82294-44596 |title= Home For Sale & Real Estate - realtor.com® |website= realtor.com |access-date=2016-11-04}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.city-data.com/denton-county/W/Whitebridge-Road-1.html |title= Property valuation of 2000 (Billy J Dalton), 2001 (Linda Szydlik), 2004, 2005, 2008 (Mary L Ribb), 2009 (Paul J Ezzo & Patricia A Ezzo), 2010 (Michael D Murdock), 2013 (tax assessments) |last= |first=|date= |website= www.city-data.com |access-date= 2016-11-04}}</ref>
