What should we do?  Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?  Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.  Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!  SHUT UP AND STUDY!  What are you doing? That isn't gonna work, dumbass! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're supposed to be studying!  Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard! Cartman? Cartman??  No, turdpants, it's Kyle! Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit!  Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?! Cartman?  Cartman?? Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!!  But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again! Oh, Jesus...  God damnit!
