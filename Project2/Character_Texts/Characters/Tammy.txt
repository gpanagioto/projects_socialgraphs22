Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school? TGI Friday's? Yeah, okay. But...  See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers. You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome?   Whoooooo!  Aaah-oww! You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe! Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!  Huh? They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God! It's a dream come true!  What? You think so? Me neither.   Purity rings? Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring. No! I don't want to watch ''Grey's Anatomy'', Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken. Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway. Oh I feel better already! What say you and me... go to TGI Fridays? 
Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality. We don't go to work for another hour. He wants us to side with him? That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise. 
Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here. 
A little girl is making big waves with her fight against Photoshop. 
Yeah, we created some this morning. I'm a human paladin and Nichole is a Tiefling warlock.  We love Blood And Plunder. Are we gonna play like a four-on-four skirmish with two different factions?  Yeah. Who wants unpainted miniatures, right?  Bet you can't beat Nichole at Blood Rage.
