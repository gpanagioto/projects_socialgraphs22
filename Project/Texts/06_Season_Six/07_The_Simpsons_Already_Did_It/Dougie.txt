Professor Chaos! I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood. What dastardly deed are we doing now?  Oh, awesome! Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons.  They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun. So how do we build it? No. What? Oh, uh... You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out. ...Simpsons did it. They did it in episode 204. Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!" ...Simpsons did it. No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that. Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!   Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Don't have a cow, man. Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!!
