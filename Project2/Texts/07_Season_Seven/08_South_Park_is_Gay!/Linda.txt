Haven't you seen ''Queer Eye For the Straight Guy'', Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best. And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house. I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look. What? I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband. You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!! That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.
