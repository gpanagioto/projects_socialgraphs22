What the hell are you singing, Cartman? When is Mr. Hat coming back? He'd be better used as a coat rack. He singing some new hit song. Wow, then you should get money for it! Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time. It’s the same goddamn song! We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer! I don't know. I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman. What's going on? Yeah. Ready, Cartman? What's that, dude? Did you ever know any famous people? You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you. Yeah, b-but how? Whoa, dude, this house is huge. Are you Elton John? Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys. Hi, are you Elton John? We're trying to raise money for our school chef. Yeah, dude. Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time! He’s not dying, Cartman! Yeah. Do you know him? Gosh, thanks, Rick James. We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed. Cartman? But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make? Dude... Chef is gone. But what are we gonna do? Chef Aid? Hey, that's a great idea! Hmm... This isn't going over so well. Wow, cool! We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you! Well, we helped. You bastard! Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
