 A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?  And what about the food?  Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form?  It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings. And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?  Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say "yes." Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets.  With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army. The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables. And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving. But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been...  haunted! The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave?
