Alright,   We know! Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again! That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  There. It's, uh it's nothing, really. Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells." When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear. Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son.   Yes I do, yes I do.  Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already? One point five? Come on, Stan, you can do this!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!  Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.  Hey, hey Sharon. So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space. Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon? Hullo? Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing.  That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan. He's got a gun! What do you want? Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy. Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son. We're working on it!   Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.  Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?! Hello? Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!  What?!  Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything. Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax. Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly? No, we're sure. That's right, yep, you're the first ones. ...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact! We will give you a call! Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before. Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast! No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien. Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck. Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look. Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!  You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out. But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again. Oh my God. Spaaace caaash.  Right.  Or what if we didn't call the cops? Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it. Will you relax, Stan?  Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Ah hey, space officers. Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.  There wasn't any space cash. Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash? Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.  Probably.  Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything! No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions! Nobody can build anything!! Wha?! Finland?!   Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything. Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment? All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland. Oh dammit! Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?  Whaa-wha-what about it?  Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland. Hey guys, Finland's dead. Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.  No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide. Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'. Stan? Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.  Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?  Yeah, no, we've told you everything, space officers.  Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax! It was... a trick? No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!}}
