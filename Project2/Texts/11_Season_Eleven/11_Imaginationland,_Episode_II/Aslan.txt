Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate. And what say you, Morpheus? Bring him here! I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't. It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.
