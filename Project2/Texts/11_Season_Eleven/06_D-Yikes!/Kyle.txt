Oh God, here we go again. Our whole weekend is shot. They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes! What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us. He catches the feesh so, then he can make money. You said you all wrote essays. Dude, we're totally fucked now! This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail! Son of a bitch!  Jimmy, did you finish your book report? We're dead.  Really? Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something.
