'''Black Panther''' is a [[fictional character|<!-- Please do not specify what type of character you think. Categories like "superhero" & "supervillian" are subjective. It's better to use a generic term and let the reader decide for themselves.--> fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist-coplotter [[Jack Kirby]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52 ([[cover-date]]d July 1966) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. Black Panther's real name is '''T'Challa''', and he is depicted as the king and protector of the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda]]. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.

Black Panther is the first superhero of [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|African descent]]<!--People of African descent include Africans. This is a stronger statement than simply saying "first African superhero".--> in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early [[Black people|black]] superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972), and [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973) or [[DC Comics]]' [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] in the role of [[Green Lantern]] (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by [[White Tiger (Kasper Cole)|Kasper Cole]], a multiracial [[New York City]] [[New York City Police Department|police officer]]. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]] and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda was also given to T'Challa's sister [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] while he was in a coma for a short time.

Black Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. [[Chadwick Boseman]] portrayed the [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'s films: ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and voiced alternate versions of the character in the first season of the [[animated series]] ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021).

In 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Books Heroes" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/lists/comic-book-heroes/51 |title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes: #51 Black Panther |website=IGN |access-date=March 20, 2018 |archive-date=October 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001070726/http://www.ign.com/lists/comic-book-heroes/51 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO), nor the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[World War II]] [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|761st "Black Panthers" Tank Battalion]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #183|access-date= December 13, 2008|last= Cronin|first= Brian|date= December 5, 2008|archive-date= December 6, 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206203921/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Yuen/BPP_logo.html |title= Origin of the Black Panther Party logo |access-date= December 13, 2008 |work= H.K.

===Publication history<!--subhead per WikiProject Comics style-->===
[[File:Fantastic Four (1961) ,52.jpeg|thumb|upright|Black Panther first appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52 (July 1966).]]
The origin of the idea for the character was disputed by both Kirby and Lee. Jack Kirby claimed sole credit for the creation of the character in ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #134, from February 1990, stating that a realization that there were no black characters in his comics demanded some be added for "human reasons".<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.tcj.com/jack-kirby-interview/6/|title = Jack Kirby Interview - Page 6 of 8|date = May 23, 2011|access-date = February 21, 2022|archive-date = February 8, 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220208033746/https://www.tcj.com/jack-kirby-interview/6/|url-status = live}}</ref> Stan Lee claims the character was created by his desire in the mid-60s to include more African and African-American characters in Marvel Comics. While there is no documentation showing which version of the creation is closer to the truth, by 1966 Kirby is thought to have been largely plotting the book on his own<ref>{{Cite web|title=Marvel, Jack Kirby, and the Comic-Book Artist's Plight|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/09/marvel-jack-kirby-and-the-plight-of-the-comic-book-artist/498299/|website=[[The Atlantic]]|author=Asher Elbein|date=September 2016|access-date=February 21, 2022|archive-date=February 21, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220221071304/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/09/marvel-jack-kirby-and-the-plight-of-the-comic-book-artist/498299/|url-status=live}}</ref> and was having to explain the stories to Lee when the pages arrived in the Marvel offices, as had happened a few issues prior with the Silver Surfer in ''The Fantastic Four'' #48 (March 1966). In a 1968 interview Lee stated:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://zak-site.com/Great-American-Novel/ff_Lee-Kirby.html |title=Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, who did what |access-date=February 21, 2022 |archive-date=February 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220221071305/https://zak-site.com/Great-American-Novel/ff_Lee-Kirby.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{blockquote|Some artists, such as Jack Kirby, need no plot at all.

He’s so good at plots, I’m sure he’s a thousand times better than I. He just about makes up the plots for these stories. All I do is a little editing.}}

In an interview, Kirby shared the same genesis as Lee, "I came up with the Black Panther because I realized I had no blacks in my strip. I’d never drawn a black. I needed a black. I suddenly discovered that I had a lot of black readers. My first friend was a black! And here I was ignoring them because I was associating with everybody else."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tcj.com/jack-kirby-interview/6/ | title=Jack Kirby Interview - Page 6 of 8 | date=May 23, 2011 | access-date=February 21, 2022 | archive-date=February 8, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220208033746/https://www.tcj.com/jack-kirby-interview/6/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

Roy Thomas has made claims that support Lee's version of events, while Kirby was supported by his wife and prior artwork.  In 1963, they included a black character, [[Gabe Jones]], in the ensemble cast of ''[[Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos]]'',<ref>{{cite book |title=Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe |last1=Lee |first1=Stan |first2=Roy |last2=Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-4027-4225-5 |page = 54 }}</ref> and Lee encouraged artists to include black characters in crowd scenes.<ref name=Chron>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |pages=89–90}}</ref> In a 1998 interview, Lee explained his motivation: "I wasn't thinking of civil rights. I had a lot of friends who were black and we had artists who were black. So it occurred to me... why aren't there any black heroes?"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brodsky |first1=Bob |title=Stan the Man Lee: Maestro of the Marvel Mythos |journal=Comic Book Marketplace |date=July 1998 |issue=#61 |pages=28–36, 45–54}}</ref> Soon after Black Panther was introduced, Marvel also added two more recurring black characters: Jill Jerrold in ''[[Modeling with Millie]]'', and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=Chron/>

There was some internal debate at Marvel with Lee being unsure about how far to go with the commercially risky introduction of a black superhero. In the first version of the cover for ''Fantastic Four'' #52, Kirby drew the Black Panther wearing a cowl that exposed his face. In the published version, the cowl became a full face-mask. Previews in other comics did not show the cover at all, indicating that Lee was hesitant.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Sean |title=Marvel Comics: The Untold Story |date=2013 |publisher=Harper Perennial |isbn=978-0061992117 |chapter=Chapter 3}}</ref>

Following his debut in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52–53 (July – August 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' Annual #5 (1967) and with [[Captain America]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #97–99 and ''Captain America'' 100 (January – April 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda]] to [[New York City]] to join the titular American superhero team in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'',<!--Note to researchers--#s 52, 69, 92; 56 was a cameo, and 99 was with Avengers, as were his ''Hulk'' and ''Sub-Mariner'' appearances--> and fought [[Doctor Doom]] in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6–7 (June & August 1971), in that [[supervillain]]'s short-lived starring feature.

He received his first starring feature with ''[[Jungle Action]]'' #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in ''The Avengers'' #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by [[Don McGregor]], with art by [[pencilers]] [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gil Kane]], and [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]], and which gave inkers [[Klaus Janson]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]] some of their first professional exposure.

One now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.<ref name="sacks">{{cite web|last=Sacks |first=Jason |url=http://www.fanboyplanet.com/comics/js-panthersrage.php |title=Panther's Rage: The First Marvel Graphic Novel |website=Fanboy Planet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704142442/http://www.fanboyplanet.com/comics/js-panthersrage.php |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first, "Panther's Rage", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc "Marvel's first [[graphic novel]]":

{{blockquote|text=[T]here were real character arcs in [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] [comics] over time. But ... "Panther's Rage" is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of ''Jungle Action'' (#s 6 through 18), "Panther's Rage" is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.<ref name="sacks" />}}

The second and final arc, "Panther vs. the Klan", ran as mostly 17-page stories in ''Jungle Action'' #19–24 (January – November 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of ''Daredevil'' #69 (October 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.<ref name=gcd2 /> The subject matter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.<ref>McGregor, Don. "Panther's Chronicles" (introduction), ''Marvel Masterworks: The Black Panther Vol. 1'' (Marvel Worldwide, 2010), pp. xii–xii (unnumbered).</ref>

African-American writer-editor [[Dwayne McDuffie]] said of the ''Jungle Action'' "Black Panther" feature:

{{blockquote|text=This overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.<ref name=dmd />}}

Writer [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]'s and penciller [[Mark Texeira]]'s 1998 series ''The Black Panther'' vol. 3 used [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Venomm]],<!--spelled correctly with double M--> and other characters introduced in "Panther's Rage", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protégé, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. "I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to," adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.<ref>{{cite news| first=Ethan|last= Sacks| title=The unsung heroes: Blade & Co. help to close racial divide| newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]| date=March 19, 2002 }}</ref>

The last 13 issues (#50–62) saw the main character replaced by a [[multiracial]] [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officer]] named [[Kasper Cole]], with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the [[White Tiger (comics)#Kasper Cole|White Tiger]], was placed in the series ''[[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]]'', running concurrently with the final few ''Black Panther'' issues. ''The Crew'' was canceled with issue #7.

==Fictional character biography==
{{In-universe|section|date=February 2015}}
{{long plot|date=December 2017}}

===Early life and background===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Avengers52.jpg|thumb|upright|Debut of the short-lived cowl mask on the cover of ''[[Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968). Art by [[John Buscema]].]] -->
The Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also [[paramount chief]] of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.

In the distant past, a [[meteorite]] made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King [[T'Chaka]], like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with '''T'Challa''', and his second wife [[Ramonda (comics)|Ramonda]] was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of [[South Africa]], so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.<ref name="MCP13-37">''Marvel Comics Presents'' #13–37 (February – December 1989)</ref> T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaw]] in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.<ref name="FF53">''Fantastic Four'' #53 (August 1966)</ref>

T'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan [[walkabout]] [[rite of passage]], T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #100 (December 1980), revised in ''Storm'' vol. 2 #1–6 (2006)</ref> The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.

T'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zeraze—the Wakandan [[secret police]]—and its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = Richard S an Comicraft Letters|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = The Price|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #4|date = February 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.<ref name="FF53"/> Later, to keep peace, he picked ''[[Dora Milaje]]'' ("adored ones") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time <!--Under "Powers & abilities, it says his Ph.D. is from Oxford University, in Oxford, England. Here the phrase says: in [[New York City]]--> before returning to his kingship.

In his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to neutralize them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #52–53 (July – August 1966)</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/#more-60191 |title=A Year of Cool Comics—Day 262 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=September 19, 2010 |access-date=March 4, 2015 |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708181411/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/#more-60191 |url-status=live }}</ref> For their part, the Four manage to rally and stymie T'Challa in a team counter-attack, enabling the impressed King to stand down and explain himself to the team's satisfaction. After the ruler makes proper amends to the Four, they befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #5 (1967)</ref> T'Challa later joins the Avengers,<ref>''The Avengers'' #52 (May 1968)</ref> beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the [[Man-Ape]] while with the group,<ref>''The Avengers'' #62 (March 1969)</ref> and then meets the American singer [[Monica Lynne]],<ref>''The Avengers'' #73 (February 1970)</ref> with whom he becomes romantically involved. He helps the Avengers defeat the second [[Sons of the Serpent]], and then reveals his true identity on American television.<ref>''The Avengers'' #74 (March 1970)</ref> He encounters Daredevil and reveals to him he had deduced Daredevil's true identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #69 (October 1970)</ref>

===Return to Wakanda===
After receiving numerous urgent official letters requesting him to return to his increasingly troubled homeland,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Englehart|first1=Steve|last2=Brown|first2=Bob|title=All the Sounds and Sights of Death!|journal=The Avengers|date=August 1974|volume=|issue= #126}}</ref> the Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions,<ref>''[[Jungle Action]]'' #6–18 (September 1973 – November 1975)</ref> the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref>''Jungle Action'' #19–22 and 24 (Jan.–July and November 1976)</ref> He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs.<ref>''Black Panther'' #1–4 (January – July 1977)</ref> These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, [[telepathy|telepathic]] Panther with a terminal [[cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]], whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.{{issue|date=August 2018}}

Later, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during [[apartheid]].<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #13–37 (Late Feb.–December 1989)</ref> T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,<ref>''Black Panther: Panther's Prey'' #1–4 (May – October 1991)</ref> though the couple never marry.

Years later, the Panther accepts a [[Washington, D.C.]] envoy, [[Everett K. Ross]], and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is "Xcon", an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #1–12 (November 1998 – October 1999)</ref> Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to [[nationalize]] foreign companies.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #13–19 (December 1999 – June 2000)</ref> Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther,<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #20 (July 2000)</ref> but falls into a [[coma]] upon eating the heart-shaped herb—poisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #24 (November 2000)</ref> T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.

Later, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #49 (November 2002)</ref> and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.

===Marriage and passing the mantle===
{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}
T'Challa recounts the story of his ascension as the Black Panther in the fourth volume of his eponymous comic book series. He defeated his uncle during the Black Panther celebration,<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #2</ref> and during his [[walkabout]] when he met and fell in love with a street urchin named Ororo in Cairo, Egypt.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #3</ref> Unbeknownst to him the US government is planning a coup to get access to the vibranium. They allow Klaw to recruit a team of villains to support his totalitarian neighbor, Niganda. Klaw recruits [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], [[Batroc the Leaper]], and [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] to lead the invasion. The US government then deploys an army of [[Deathlok]]s to "support" T'Challa and justify an invasion, but T'Challa kills Klaw and Storm wipes out the Deathlok army in a hurricane.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #6</ref>

T'Challa then helps his old flame [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]] reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #14</ref> Shortly afterwards, he proposes and the two are married,<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #14-15</ref> in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #18</ref> One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the [[Inhumans]], Doctor Doom, the [[President of the United States]] and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], with only the last one ending well.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #21</ref> After the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]], the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #23</ref> During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan [[diplomatic mission|embassy]] in [[Manhattan]] is heavily damaged, though no Wakandans are hurt.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #25</ref> After the confrontation, the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing Fantastic Four members [[Mister Fantastic|Reed]] and [[Invisible Woman|Sue Richards]] before returning to Wakanda.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #544</ref>

Upon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from [[Monica Rambeau]] (a.k.a. Pulsar).<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #35–37</ref> Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the [[Skrulls]], who had infiltrated as part of their "[[Secret Invasion]]" plan to conquer Earth.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #38–41</ref> Prince Namor attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains. Attacked by the forces of fellow Cabal member Doctor Doom, T'Challa is left comatose.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #1–2</ref> His sister [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] is trained as the next Black Panther, with the mantle passing onto her officially after T'Challa awakens from his coma and attempts to recover from his injuries.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #2–7</ref>

In the aftermath, T'Challa loses all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the Panther totem. As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #8</ref> He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5 #9–10">''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #9–10</ref> which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.<ref>''Doomwar'' #5</ref>

===The Man Without Fear===
After the events of "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]", Matt Murdock (the superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of [[Foggy Nelson]], T'Challa assumes the identity of '''Mr. Okonkwo''', an [[immigrant]] from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Congo]] and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from [[Serbia]] who was formerly involved in violent [[Serbian nationalism]], and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle">{{Cite book|title=Black Panther: The Man Without Fear ''Urban Jungle'' |first=David |last=Liss |isbn=978-0-7851-4523-3 |year=2011}}</ref>

T'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself "the Impaler". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

T'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of children—Gabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

===Wakanda again===
Shortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri.

===Incursions===
After witnessing an alternate Earth over Wakanda being destroyed by the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]], T'Challa reforms the Illuminati—with Beast replacing the now-deceased Charles Xavier—to confront the threat of the Incursions, parallel universes colliding with each other to the destruction of both. Although able to avert one Incursion with the Infinity Gauntlet, the subsequent destruction of the Infinity Gems forces the group to decide to resort to more questionable measures to protect Earth from future Incursions, wiping Captain America's mind so that he will not remember these events, allowing them to do "what needs to be done".<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #1–3</ref> Although equipped with planet-destroying weapons to protect Earth, the Illuminati mostly become disgusted with the wholesale slaughter, until Namor breaks off from the group to form a new Cabal of villains to do what the heroes will not. Despite Namor's Cabal achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #40</ref> although Namor and the Cabal escape to the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate universe]] when the other Earth has a simultaneous Incursion.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #41</ref>

===''Secret Wars''===
When the final Incursion occurs during the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, resulting in all realities collapsing into one Earth, Black Panther is one of the few heroes to survive the Incursion in a specially-designed "life pod"—other survivors including [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Star-Lord]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Jane Foster (comics)|the new Thor]], [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] and a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]-enhanced [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]—although they are only released into the new world after an eight-year stasis.

As Reed takes Doom's power and sets out to rebuild the multiverse, T'Challa uses the Time Gem to take himself back to Wakanda before the Incursions, proclaiming to his people that they will lead the way to the stars and explore new ideas.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #9 (2015).

Once Panther and Zemo are alone, Winter Soldier rescues Panther. Panther entrusts the unconscious Zemo to Winter Soldier, while trailing Rogers and Zola into the secret lab.

After the defeat of Supreme Hydra Steve Rogers, Black Panther establishes his quest to go across the universe with his people, and found an [[Galactic empire|Intergalactic Empire]] of Wakanda on Planet Bast, located in the Benhazin Star System.<ref>''[[Marvel Legacy]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-intergalactic-empire-wakanda-things-should-know/|title=Black Panther: 10 Things Fans Should Know About The Intergalactic Empire Of Wakanda|date=December 11, 2019|website=CBR|language=en-US|access-date=January 6, 2020|archive-date=December 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212121704/https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-intergalactic-empire-wakanda-things-should-know/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Black Panther later hosts a meeting with [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] from Saudi Arabia, [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]] from Israel, [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] from Japan, [[Collective Man]] from China, [[Captain Britain]] from the United Kingdom, and [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]] from Russia in the Eden Room of Avengers Mountain. The meeting has Black Panther proposing that they work together to protect the world from future threats. Sabra talked to Black Panther about the actions caused by Namor and the Defenders of the Deep. Losing his patience, Ursa Major started to get aggressive towards Black Panther. This caused Black Panther to have Avengers Mountain's teleportation system send Ursa Major to Siberia. Afterwards, Black Panther apologized and commented to the other representatives that he hoped that the Russian government would send [[Crimson Dynamo]] and that they sent Ursa Major on purpose. Black Panther concluded that they will not be getting any allies from Russia. He also gave a theory that the U.S. government will not be allies of the Avengers after mentioning that somebody else repelled the Defenders of the Deep from Alaska.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #11.

Black Panther later infiltrates the Pentagon to confront [[Phil Coulson]]. When Coulson summons the [[Squadron Supreme|Squadron Supreme of America]], they plan to arrest him. Black Panther states to them that he does not know how they got their powers and that they are not the Squadron Supreme as he even asked if they trust Phil Coulson. Before they can grab him, Black Panther contacts Broo to teleport him away. As he disappears, Black Panther states that Phil Coulson will not answer their questions and that the Avengers are not their enemies unless they forced them to be.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The title "Black Panther" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to consume a special heart-shaped herb which, in addition to his mystical, [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] connection with the Wakandan [[Bast (Marvel Comics)|Panther Goddess Bast]], grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.<ref name="auto">''Fantastic Four'' #52 (July 1966)</ref><ref>''The Avengers'' #87 (April 1977)</ref>

He has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5 #9–10"/> His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther Goddess.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608"/> In addition to the resurgence of his now-superhuman abilities, he is anointed "King of the Dead", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the [[undead]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]||title=Secret Wars|volume=|issue=#7|date=November 11, 2015|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}</ref> After [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Battleworld]] and the resurgence of the Multiverse T'challa eventually showcased new powers in regards to his King of the Dead status, for not only could he reanimate the dead, but summon departed spirits into the physical world with tangible form as well. Using these spiritual energies also enables him to conjure a mystical spear of glowing blue energy to his hand.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 6 #11 (2017)</ref>

T'Challa worked with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to endow T'Challa with immunity to mystical attacks and detection in order to defeat Dr. Doom. When T'Challa's alchemical upgrade was tested by means of Wakanda's most powerful acolytes attacking T'Challa in unison, each mystical attack was absorbed and only served to strengthen T'Challa.  During these preparations, T'Challa invented a potent mystical-scientific hybrid art called "shadow physics" and was able to use it to craft shadow weapons and to track vibranium on a quantum level.<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5 #9–10"/>

As king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, and the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth.

He is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and [[scientist]]. He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physics]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. He is an expert physicist, proficient in advanced technology, and is also an inventor. T'Challa has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608"/>

The chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, although financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite book|title= Superheroes!:Capes, cowls and the creation of comic book culture|first1=Laurence |last1=Maslon|first2=Michael |last2=Kantor|page=170}}</ref>

T'Challa is rigorously trained in acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat. He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, with a unique hybrid fighting style that incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://marvel.com/characters/5/black_panther|title= Marvel 101: Black Panther|access-date= February 12, 2018|archive-date= January 21, 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180121072739/http://marvel.com/characters/5/black_panther|url-status= live}}</ref>

Over time, the two make a kind of friendship and Klaue develops a strong obsession with the culture of Wakanda coming to try to convince them to make their religion deist rather than spiritist, which causes a strong friction between him and Chanda culminating in the death of Nanali by the Nazi and in its subsequent expulsion from the country.<ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #1 (March 1993)</ref>

===Volume 3===
Journalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer "turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it". Gross applauded the title's "endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels".<ref>{{cite news| first1=Joe|last1= Gross |first2= Jeff |last2=Salamon | title=Five comic books you (or your kids)* should be reading | newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]] | date=May 30, 2002 }}</ref>

Comics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. "Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the ''Spider-Man'' comics, I want to like ''Black Panther'', but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly.

Reporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. "I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching "[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]" in rewind. My head is exploding.'"<ref>{{Cite news| first=Bill |last=Radford| title=Marvel Knights books put new spin on classic heroes| work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] | location = [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]| date=November 5, 1998 }}</ref>

===Volume 4===
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave a negative review to the first arc, "Who Is the Black Panther?", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, "Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing".<ref>{{Cite news| title=Black Panther: Who Is the Black Panther?| work=[[Publishers Weekly]]| date=October 17, 2005 }}</ref>

Journalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a "fairly unimpressive launch". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. "He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough".<ref>{{Cite news| first=Shawn |last=Jeffords | title=Is the Black Panther back?| publisher=[[Sarnia Observer]]| date=February 3, 2005 }}</ref>

T'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the "Trial of the Panther" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied, mute, and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

To save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength and night vision and a healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like [[adamantium]] claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular "favorite son", and he implores M'Baku to return.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

Fury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the [[Ultimates]].

===Sky Spider/Vibranium Man/Star Panther===
On an unnamed alternate Earth where King Killmonger conquered Wakanda and Asgard, one baby version of T'Challa was placed into a rocket and was shot into outer space to protect him from being killed by King Killmonger. He landed on the planet Chandilar of the Shi'ar Empire. Years later, T'Challa was operating as '''Sky Spider''' where he saved an alien from King Killmonger's mercenaries called the War Panthers after the alien got thrown out a window. Sky Spider claims that the War Panthers are marauders and mercenaries who do not deserve the Panther name. Sky Spider fights the War Panthers as King Killmonger attacks the village from his ship. Many tomorrows later, T'Challa is on the trail of King Killmonger as '''Vibranium Man''' complete with the Dora Milaje A.I. and attacks a War Panthers ship. When he finds the one that King Killmonger is on, Vibranium Man goes on the attack as he claims that his suit flows with the blood and spirit of the fallen Wakandans. King Killmonger called him a second-rate Tony Stark as he mentioned that his armor was forged by the gods that fell before his axe as he throws Vibranium Man off his ship quoting "Wakanda Nevermore". Three days later, Robbie Reyes, his Deathlok companion, and [[Iron Man#Earth-818|Ant-Man of Earth-818]] find Vibranium Man in a solid Vibranium cocoon in an active star. After the cocoon is removed from the star, T'Challa comes out with the powers of the "white-hot heavens" as he takes the name of '''Star Panther''' where he will use his new abilities to kill King Killmonger.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' Vol. 2 #6.
