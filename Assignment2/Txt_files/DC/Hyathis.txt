'''Hyathis''' (also known as '''Hyanthis''') is a [[fictional]] extraterrestrial [[monarch]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #3 (February 1961) and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]]. In all her ''World's Finest Comics'' appearances she is referred to as Hyanthis.

==Fictional character biography==
Hyathis is the ''Panala'' (Queen) of Alstair in the [[Antares]] solar system, Alstair shares the solar system with four other planets: '''Dhor''', '''Llarr''', and '''Mosteel''' which is farthest from Antares. Hyathis appears to be a ''Plant Elemental'' with empathic control over all plant life on Alstair. Alstairans are all plant/humanoid hybrids because they diverged from the common [[protozoa]]n evolutionary branch linking [[Flora]] and [[Fauna]] much later on than life did on [[Earth]]. All [[plant]] based Alstairans receive part of their nourishment from sunlight and have broad [[leaf|leaves]] instead of hair. The [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] based Alstairans appear to pass on the mold infection with a [[vampire|vampiric]] bite, they also prefer darkness and seem to have stringy hair.

Hyathis is continuously at war with the three other planetary monarchs in the [[Antares]] solar system: '''[[Kanjar Ro]]''', insect-like dictator of the planet ''Dhor''; '''Kromm''', the metal skinned ruler of the planet ''Mosteel''; and '''Sayyar''', the [[lizard]]-like [[emperor]] of ''Llarr''. A few years ago this four-way conflict was temporarily ended when Kanjar Ro abducted members of the [[Justice League of America]], and used his '''Gamma Gong''' to force them to defeat the rulers of Alstair, Mosteel and Llarr, placing Earth in a paralyzed state.

Hyathis was defeated and captured by the combined power of [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]]. Eventually, the entire Justice League was able to trick and defeat Kanjar Ro, and all four rulers were marooned on a small planet with a barrier created by Green Lantern's ring around it.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #3</ref> After the four of them were able to use willpower to make a crack in the barrier, Kanjar Ro escaped, leaving the others behind. Later Hyathis' loyal Alstairan followers rescued her from the prison world, and took her to the planet Thanagar. Hyathis adapted Alstairan medicine to provide a workable cure for a deadly plague sweeping the planet. She required that the Thanagarians appoint her ''Empress of Thanagar'' before she would give them the cure. Hyathis transformed the Thanagarian people into a warlike race. This led the Thanagarian Empire to attempt conquest of the planet [[Rann (fictional planet)|Rann]]. [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] was able put an end to the conflict. With the help of [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], Hawkman was also successful in deposing Hyathis.<ref>''World's Finest Comics'' #272, 273</ref> Aggressive Thanagarian factions later freed Hyathis, and then launched a shadow war against [[Earth]]. Hawkman and [[Hawkwoman|Hawkgirl]] were successful in halting these factions, but Hyathis escaped.<ref>''World's Finest Comics'' #278</ref>

Hyathis later attempted to overthrow the government of Rann by using her telepathy to turn an alien race called the ''Zaredians'' against the interplanetary law enforcers known as the [[Darkstars]]. The Zaredian attack created a diversion which allowed Hyathis to kidnap Aleea Strange, daughter of [[Adam Strange]]. Her plans were upset by the arrival of [[Superboy]] and the Ravers.<ref>''Superboy and the Ravers'' #3, 4</ref>

===Current status===
Alstair now appears to be a jungle planet whose architecture is influenced by [[Aztec]] design. Hyathis recently met [[Zauriel]], agent of [[Presence (DC Comics)|The Presence]], when the mystical [[Doctor Fate|Helmet of Fate]] landed on Alstair and was discovered by '''Okeontis''' (the "Demon in the Mold"). Okeontis represented a group mind that evolved from sentient mold on Alstair, and she used the Helmet of Fate to infect the populace with the "mold-mind".<ref>''Helmet of Fate: Zauriel'' #1</ref>

Additionally, the government ruling its sentient plant-based lifeforms seems intent upon launching invasions of other compatible worlds, including Earth.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #14-15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
* Hyathis is a plant elemental from the planet Alstair. The people of Alstair are all hybrid plant humanoids but she has a closer connection to the Green. She can command any plant on Alstair to obey her will.
* She is able to breathe underwater.
* Hyathis is a powerful telepath and often uses this power to steal the advanced technical knowledge of other alien races.

==Other versions==
* Hyathis appeared in the May 2000 ''[[Creature Commandos]]'' maxiseries by [[Tim Truman]]. Here, she was slain by Tazzala of Korrl, a woman who called herself the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]]. While the Creature Commandos series was said to take place within main DC Universe continuity, Hyathis appeared alive in later comics; thus, the Creature Commandos version may be regarded as an alternate version. Alternate versions of Kanjar Ro, Kromm and Sayyar also appear in this series.
* Shayera Thal's ([[Hawkwoman]]) maternal grandmother and Thal Provis' ex-wife was named ''Hyanthis''. Her only appearance was in ''[[Hawkworld]]'' vol. 2. Apart from the name, she has no relation to Hyathis.
