 I could use a little help here! Riley said a word her sister felt was insensitive to Muslims. Now they're all upset. She just said "Aba daba." Oh, yeah. That would be really smart. If anybody sees them, they're gonna figure out you're the father. You wanna risk that? The babies have to stay hidden because if people know the truth, then you're not PC and I'm not strong!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Hey! What the fuck are you doing?! With a box on your head?! I don't need a box on my head to use the phone! All right, Riley. Give that back to your brother.  River?? Bailey?! Emory?! I can't believe you were on your phone! It was my time to be on the phone! You were on yours all morning! Yes!  Oh God, I'm not doing this again. No! No, we don't want to file anything specific. We just need help finding some PC babies. Nono, it's five specific PC babies. No! No, these PC babies wouldn't have gotten that far! They can barely walk. I'm their mother. Woman.  Strong. Don't be ridiculous! I'm not some two-bit floozy who goes around sleeping with her boss! I am a strong woman! Those kids were born naturally by in-vitro fertilization.  We'll uh, see what we can do. In the meantime you'll just have to take a seat and wait.   Riley? You're okay! Thank God!  I'm their... vice principal. They.... did all that? I've always used the phone as a way to deal with the stress of having babies nobody could know the truth about, but... it's only made it worse. Yeah, I think so.  I don't think anyone's listening to you. I guess we can wait and ban the boxes tomorrow?
