Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice.  Who's that? Wow! Cool! You're on, dude! I think the other dog's the one that's confused. Who's Middle Park? Hey Stan, isn't that your dog? You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys. Did it work? Ooh-la-la. Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad. Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else. What'd he say? Come on dude, we have to get to practice. Uh, Chef? Chef. Chef! What's the matter dude? Wow, it's been like two days. We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan. You what?! But I never practiced quarterback. Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?! Set, set. Damn it Cartman! Cartman farted! No way dude! Ah, dude, weak. Hike! Hut, hut.  Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards! Hike! Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think! Oof.
