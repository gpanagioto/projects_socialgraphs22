==Fictional character biography==
The Agent is the son of prolific weapons designer Phineas Mason, better known in supervillain circles as the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]]. The Agent is a highly skilled covert operations specialist and has completed missions for the governments of many nations including [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

His upbringing in New York City<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z''</ref> brought him into contact with many criminals due to his father's occupation. Ill at ease with wrong-doers, the Agent sought a path in life other than aiding others in perpetrating crimes. Becoming a mercenary the Agent worked for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] though was later hired by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government to prevent the super team China Force from overthrowing their rule of [[Hong Kong]]. Returning to S.H.I.E.L.D., he was required by [[Nick Fury]] to undertake a similar mission in [[Costa Brava]] involving American-backed rebels. The Agent discovered that one of his former teachers, Teng Yun-Suan, was responsible for both of these incidents. Yun-Suan met death at the Agent's hands. As a freelance mercenary who specialized in non-lethal metahuman handlings, he assisted Nick Fury involving metahuman mercenaries.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #57</ref>

The Agent remained on good terms with his father despite the latter making a living in a field he did not approve of. The [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]] used this to their advantage and kidnapped the Agent to force the Tinkerer to work for them.<ref>''Cage'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mason encounters [[Luke Cage]] and [[Dakota North (comics)|Dakota North]] and the three defeat the Corporation. Unfortunately, Mason was apparently killed later on after which his activities as the anonymous Agent were public knowledge.<ref>''Cage'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mason's own son perished during [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]'s explosion in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]] which heralded the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'s beginning.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #16</ref>

Mason was once hired to kill an alleged mole code-named Vitamin but was found by Michael Rossi yet he escaped using the Tinkerer's devices. Mason later teamed up with [[Carol Danvers]], and the two learned about Ghazi Rashid now as a metahuman. After it's revealed that Rossi was Vitamin and Ms. Marvel gets overloaded with power, Mason almost dies from a bomb and only makes it out in time. He tracked Rossi to Brazil who he killed then spoke with [[Norman Osborn]] for his father's prison release, threatening death for Ms. Marvel's apparent death.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #33-37</ref>
