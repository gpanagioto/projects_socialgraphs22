 Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.  This golden PSP is king of all PSPs. It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals. Prepare the troops!  Where'd he go?  A feeding tube?! But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?! Oh, Goddammit.  Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls! Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back. Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry!  Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the ''Lord of the Rings'' movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle! Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating! This is TRULY a sight to behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder!  Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this.
