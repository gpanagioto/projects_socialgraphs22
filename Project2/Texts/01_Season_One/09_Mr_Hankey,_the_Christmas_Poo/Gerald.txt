Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do! Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'. Say it! Again! Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight! What did you say?! Kyle, what are you doing in there? Open this door! KYLE! Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up! It wasn't ''our'' idea to take out Santa Claus! Get him in the ribs!
