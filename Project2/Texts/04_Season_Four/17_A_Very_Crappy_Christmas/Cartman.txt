Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed.  Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay? Heh-tchoo! Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces! Family? My mom''s barely bought me any presents so far.'' Anything for more presents! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  Oh, Jesus, not this thing again. Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act. My mom could make a better Christmas special than this! Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!  Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat. What?! I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!  You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out? ...deh..OOOWW!!!  Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.  Don't call me fat, buttfucker. Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold! Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!  What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that. I guess- we might as well- go home now.  Yeah, ham. Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?! Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents. Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
