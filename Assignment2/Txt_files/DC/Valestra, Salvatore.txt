'''''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''''' (also known as '''''Batman: The Animated Movie: Mask of the Phantasm''''') is a 1993 American [[Animation|animated]] [[Romance film|romantic]] [[superhero film]] directed by [[Eric Radomski]] and [[Bruce Timm]] and written by [[Alan Burnett]], [[Paul Dini]], [[Martin Pasko]], and [[Michael Reaves]]. It features the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. The film is based on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and is the first original theatrical film produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], the first film in the [[DC Animated Universe]] and the only one released theatrically.{{efn|''[[Batman and Harley Quinn]]'' had a limited theatrical release in 2017.}} [[Kevin Conroy]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]], [[Bob Hastings]] and [[Robert Costanzo]] reprise their roles from ''The Animated Series'', joined by [[Dana Delany]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Stacy Keach|Stacy Keach Jr.]], [[Abe Vigoda]], [[Dick Miller]] and [[John P. Ryan]]. As the events of the film take place between the first and second seasons of ''Batman: The Animated Series'', its story follows Batman as he reconciles with a former lover, [[Andrea Beaumont]], and faces a mysterious vigilante who is murdering [[Gotham City]]'s crime bosses. The plot was inspired by [[Mike W. Barr]]'s ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'' comic book [[story arc]], but features an original antagonist, the Phantasm, in place of the [[Reaper (DC Comics)|Reaper]], while also borrowing elements from the ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' graphic novel, recounting how Bruce Wayne became Batman and his first attempts to fight crime.

Originally planned for a [[direct-to-video]] release, [[Warner Bros.]] gave ''Mask of the Phantasm'' a theatrical release, condensing its production into a strenuous eight-month schedule. The film was the first theatrical feature film produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], and was released through the studio's [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]]<ref name="afi" /> division on December 25, 1993, to positive reviews from critics, who praised the stylized animation, voice performances, story, and music. In the years since its release, ''Mask of the Phantasm'' has continued to receive acclaim. In 2011, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' ranked it as one of the 10 best superhero films ever. In 2017, [[Screen Rant]] named the film the best ''Batman'' movie of all time. In 2018, ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine called the film "the greatest ''Batman'' movie". In 2022, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine named it the best ''Batman'' film. Also in 2022, nearly 30 years after its release, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed ''Mask of the Phantasm'' at number 19 on its list of the 50 Greatest Superhero Movies of All Time, being the only [[Traditional animation|traditionally-animated]] film included, the third-best animated superhero film and the second-best ''Batman'' film of all time, behind only ''[[The Dark Knight]]'' (number 8).<!--sourced in Legacy section-->

Due to the decision to release it in theaters on short notice, ''Mask of the Phantasm'' [[Box office bomb|failed at the box office]]. After its release on home media, it became financially successful. Its success led to direct-to-video sequels, ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' (1998) and ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' (2003). Until the limited release of ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' in 2016, ''Mask of the Phantasm'' was the only animated ''Batman'' film to be given a theatrical release, as well as the only one to receive a full theatrical release until ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' in 2017.

==Plot==
<!-- The film is presented in a non-linear narrative. This plot synopsis is written chronologically. -->

After meeting while visiting their parents' graves at Gotham Cemetery, a young Bruce Wayne and [[Andrea Beaumont]] begin a relationship. At the same time Bruce makes his first attempts at crime-fighting, but while he succeeds in foiling robberies he is discouraged that the criminals do not fear him. Bruce becomes conflicted about whether to commit to his relationship with Andrea or defend [[Gotham City]] to avenge his parents, but eventually proposes marriage. Andrea accepts, only to mysteriously leave Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont, ending the engagement in a [[Dear John letter]]. Heartbroken, Bruce assumes the mantle of [[Batman]].

Ten years later, Batman breaks up a meeting of Gotham [[Organized crime|crime bosses]] led by Chuckie Sol. When Sol tries to escape in his car, he is killed by a cloaked figure, the "Phantasm", who causes him to speed out of control and fatally crash into a building. Batman is witnessed at the scene and it is believed he killed Sol, with city councilman Arthur Reeves, who is corrupt and on the mob's payroll, vowing to have him arrested. 

The Phantasm murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in the Gotham Cemetery, where Bronski's bodyguards see Phantasm and mistake him for Batman. Batman investigates the scene of Bronski's death and encounters Andrea, inadvertently revealing his identity to her. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster, Salvatore Valestra, later finding a photograph of the four together in Valestra's home. Paranoid that Batman will come for him next, the now-elderly Valestra asks Reeves for help, but is refused. In desperation, he turns to the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].

The Phantasm goes to kill Valestra at his mansion, only to find him dead from exposure to Joker's venom. Seeing Phantasm through a camera, Joker realizes Batman is not the murderer and detonates a bomb he planted in the mansion. Phantasm escapes the blast and is pursued by Batman but disappears, leaving Batman ambushed by the police but saved from arrest by Andrea. She explains to Bruce her father [[embezzlement|embezzled]] money from Valestra and was forced to repay it; Valestra then demanded he pay more and put a [[Contract killing|hit]] on Carl, prompting him to go into hiding with Andrea. Together once again, the two consider resuming their relationship. Bruce believes Carl Beaumont to be the Phantasm until he takes another look at the photo with him and Valestra, recognizing one of Valestra's men as the Joker.

Believing him to be behind the Phantasm in order to erase his mob connections, Joker presses Reeves for information before poisoning him with venom. Driven insane, Reeves is taken to the hospital, where Batman interrogates him. Reeves, who worked as Carl's accountant before going into politics, confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape but told Valestra their location in exchange for the funding needed to launch his first campaign. Both Batman and Joker deduce that the Phantasm is Andrea, who intends to wipe out the Valestra mob for killing her father and ruining her chance to marry Bruce.

Andrea tracks down Joker, her father's killer, to his hideout in Gotham's abandoned World's Fair. They fight but are interrupted by Batman, who begs Andrea to stop, to no avail. Joker prepares to blow up the fair but is seized by Andrea, who bids Batman goodbye; having barely survived the blast, Batman finds no trace of either Andrea or the Joker. Bruce is later consoled by [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] in the [[Batcave]], who assures him Andrea could not have been helped, before finding Andrea's locket containing a picture of them together. A sorrowful Andrea departs Gotham and a saddened Batman, cleared of the accusations against him, resumes crimefighting.

==Production==
Impressed by the success of the first season of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Warner Bros.]] assigned Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at [[Arkham Asylum]] and face a [[kangaroo court]] in which the villains try him for making them what they are. The idea's concept, however, was considered "too brainy", as it required Batman to be immobile for a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode "Trial", which was aired after the film's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/batman-mask-of-the-phantasm-animated-movie-facts-trivia/|title=15 Things You Didn't Know About Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm|date=February 1, 2017|website=[[Screen Rant]]|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Although the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television series' regular [[rogues gallery]]. Burnett also cited he "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head."<ref name="Burnett">{{cite book |author1= Paul Dini |author2-link=Chip Kidd |author2=Chip Kidd | title =Batman Animated | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 1998 | page = 114 | isbn = 978-1-84023-016-1| title-link =Batman Animated |author1-link=Paul Dini }}</ref> Members of the creative team have claimed that they did not intend for the Joker to appear in the film; [[Paul Dini]] has contradicted this, stating that the Joker's role was always part of the story from the beginning of the film's production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Paul_Dini/status/900566977831239680|title=Paul_Dini on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref> The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film, as they did not want any connection to [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', but writer Michael Reaves said, "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way that we never could in live-action."<ref name="Animation">{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Tracy|title =Interview with Michael Reaves|publisher=Animation Artist|url= http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html|access-date= January 22, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080211171116/http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html| archive-date= February 11, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, [[Bruce Timm]] and Burnett convinced frequent ''Animated Series'' writer Dini to not use [[Harley Quinn]] in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously used in the episodes "Joker's Wild" and "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/twomorrows/docs/backissue99preview|title=Back Issue #99|website=Issuu.com|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref>

Aiding Burnett in writing the script were [[Martin Pasko]], who handled most of the flashback segments; Reaves, who wrote the [[climax (narrative)|climax]]; and Dini, who claims he "filled in holes here and there".<ref name="Burnett" /> The film's plot was heavily influenced by the 1987 miniseries ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'', written by [[Mike W. Barr]] and illustrated by [[Alan Davis]], [[Paul Neary]], [[Alfredo Alcala]], [[Mark Farmer]] and [[Todd McFarlane]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Sims|title =Ask Chris #92: The Great and Terrible 'Batman: Year Two'|website=[[Comics Alliance]]|date=February 3, 2012|url=http://comicsalliance.com/ask-chris-batman-year-two/?trackback=tsmclip|access-date= June 14, 2017}}</ref> [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 classic ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' served as an influence for the flashbacks, a story about loss and the passage of time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Les|last=Daniels|title=Batman: The Complete History|isbn=978-0-8118-2470-5|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|location=New York City|page=184|year=2000|author-link=Les Daniels}}</ref> The character of Hazel, the cook robot of the World of the Future Fair, was named by Burnett after Hazel the Maid (portrayed by actress [[Shirley Booth]]), ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' protagonist of cartoonist [[Ted Key]]'s TV series ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]''.<ref>{{cite tweet|first=Paul|last=Dini|authorlink=Paul Dini|user=Paul_Dini|url=https://twitter.com/Paul_Dini/status/902309884657524738|title=Alan Burnett named her after Hazel the maid by cartoonist Ted Key.

According to Burnett, the Phantasm was like the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] with a cape, although the idea was to make him resemble the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydv8TS2wids| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211115/Ydv8TS2wids| archive-date=2021-11-15 | url-status=live|title=The Making Of Batman Mask of The Phantasm|last=Living Abstraction|date=September 11, 2015|access-date=June 4, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> something that even the Joker mentions in the finished version of the film. 
{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote="It was basically an expanded episode. We boarded the script and did all of our designs and shipped it overseas.

Early in production, Warner Bros. decided to release ''Phantasm'' theatrically, rather than [[Direct-to-video|straight to video]]. That left less than a year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].<ref name="Radomski">Dini, Kidd, p.117</ref> The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.<ref>{{cite news|first=Emru |last=Townsend|title=Paul Dini: From Babs and Buster Bunny to Batman|website=Purple Planet Media|date=May 17, 1999|url=http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|access-date=January 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726212141/http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|archive-date=July 26, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Warner Bros. also increased the production budget to $6 million,<ref name="Miller" /> which gave the filmmakers opportunities for more elaborate set pieces. The opening title sequence featured a flight through an entirely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Gotham City]].<ref name="Burnett" /> As a visual joke, sequence director [[Kevin Altieri]] set the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film inside a miniature automated model of Gotham City, where Batman and the Joker are giants. This was an homage to a mainstay of Batman comic books of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, often featuring the hero fighting against a backdrop of gigantic props (they would later do another homage to Sprang's works in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark Knight").<ref name="Radomski" /> From start to finish, the film was completed within eight months.<ref name="Miller" />

==Themes==
Paul Dini intended each of the flashbacks into Batman's love life to "have a tendency to get worse, when you hope things will get better." Bruce's relationship with Andrea, which at first shows promise, eventually turns into turmoil.<ref name="turmoil">{{cite news|first=Richard |last=Verrier|title=More That Meets the Eye: Producer-Writer of ''Batman'' Gives All| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 14, 1996}}</ref> At first, Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage, but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship. This eventually leads into Bruce's decision to become Batman.<ref name="turmoil" /> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' felt this scene paralleled Andrea's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love when she finds her own father murdered. Both events transform the two people (Bruce becomes Batman, Andrea becomes the Phantasm).<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Richard|last=Corliss| title=Corliss' Roundups of Latest VHS Releases| magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 1994| author-link=Richard Corliss}}</ref> One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents' tombstone saying, "I didn't count on being happy." According to Reaves, this scene was to be a pivotal moment in Bruce's tragic life, as he denies himself the opportunity to live a normal life.<ref name="Animation" /> Reaves also stated: "When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time, [after Andrea breaks their engagement], and Alfred says 'My God!' he's reacting in horror, because he's watching this man he's helped raise from childhood, this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life, at last embrace the unspeakable."<ref name="Animation" />

The soundtrack was composed by [[Shirley Walker]], the main composer for ''The Animated Series''. Walker cited the score as a favorite among her own compositions.<ref>{{cite news|first=Randall|last=Larson|title = Remembering Shirley Walker|work = Mania Music|date = December 7, 2006|url = http://www.mania.com/52977.html|access-date = December 16, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061210032117/http://www.mania.com/52977.html|archive-date = December 10, 2006}}</ref> In an interview with Cinemusic.com, Walker explained that the "latin" lyrics used in the Main Title were actually names of key Warner Bros. staff read backwards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Batman: Mask of the Phantasm|url=http://www.cinemusic.net/reviews/1993/batmanmotp.html|website=Cinemusic.net|access-date=June 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110192716/http://www.cinemusic.net/reviews/1993/batmanmotp.html|archive-date=January 10, 2007}}</ref> The song "I Never Even Told You" was written by [[Siedah Garrett]] and [[Glen Ballard]]. It was performed by [[Tia Carrere]]. [[Hans Zimmer]], who would later compose the score for ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'', played the synthesizer on the score.

The score was originally released on December 14, 1993, by [[Reprise Records]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} On March 24, 2009, La-La Land Records released a limited expanded edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lalalandrecords.com/Site/BatManMOTP.html|title=film music - movie music- film score - Batman Mask Of The Phantasm - Shirley Walker - Limited Edition|website=lalalandrecords.com|access-date=June 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029121801/http://www.lalalandrecords.com/Site/BatManMOTP.html|archive-date=October 29, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The release includes all tracks found on the original release with some tracks expanded.

In December 1993, two [[novelization]]s were released.

[[Kenner Products|Kenner]], who had already released toys for the cartoon series, produced several tie-in figures for the film, including Joker and the Phantasm (packaged unmasked, spoiling a pivotal plot point in the film). ''Batman & Robin Adventures Annual #1: Shadow of the Phantasm'' is a comic book sequel to the film. It was written by Dini and released in 1996. In 2015, a DC Collectibles action figure 2-pack featuring Batman and Phantasm was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23509-dc-reveals-2015-collectibles-line-up-arrow-the-flash-1st-scaled-batman-tas-batmobile.html|title=DC Reveals 2015 Collectibles Line-Up - Arrow, the Flash, 1st Scaled Batman: TAS Batmobile|website=Newsarama.com|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'' opened on December 25, 1993 in the United States in 1,506 theaters, accumulating $1,189,975 over its first 2 days. The film went on to gross $5,795,524 in the domestic total box office intake.<ref name=mojo/> The filmmakers blamed [[Warner Bros.]] for the unsuccessful marketing campaign, which is commonly attributed to the rushed production schedule due to studio's last-minute decision to release the film theatrically. Despite this, ''Mask of the Phantasm'' eventually turned a profit with its various home media releases.<ref name="Radomski" />
