Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now? Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend? ...Oh okay.  So I'm, I'm not your friend then? ...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend? Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr? Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends? Oh cool! Okay.  Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma? Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her! That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it.  Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back. Stan, poke your grandma! Yahtzee! Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore? Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
