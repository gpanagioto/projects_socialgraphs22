==Fictional character biography==
Frenchie was originally romantically involved with a woman named Isabelle Kristel, but she later left him. After this, he became a mercenary, where he encountered [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]] and [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]]. Once Spector became Moon Knight, Frenchie helped him fight Bushman, who had betrayed them. He would later design and build Moon Knight’s Mooncopter.

Frenchie then went undercover in order to infiltrate the crime organization the Committee, under the alias '''Monsieur LeBlanc''', which allowed Moon Knight to bring down the organization.

Frenchie was later crippled when Moon Knight’s brother [[Shadow Knight (comics)|Randall Spector]] caused an explosion at Moon Knight’s [[mansion]]. His girlfriend Chloe Tran also informed him that he carried the bloodline of the Hellbent, a race of supernatural beings, and that he has the ability to transform into his ancestors.

After being driven away by Moon Knight, Frenchie began to have an affair with Rob Silverman, and they opened and ran a restaurant called ''En Table''. [[Norman Osborn]] learned that Frenchie was an associate of Moon Knight, and sent a gang to kill him and Silverman in order to provoke Moon Knight. The attack left Silverman in critical condition, which caused Frenchie and Moon Knight to again join forces and attack the gang who attacked them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/universe/Frenchie_(DuChamp,_Jean-Paul)|title = Frenchie (Jean-Paul DuChamp) Powers, Enemies, History &#124; Marvel}}</ref>
