 That's pretty kewl. Let's see...  The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-   Are you talkin' to me?! What's your problem, kid?! What?  Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?  All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble? ''Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance]'' haha. HahaHAAhahahaha.  I don't need the toy! I've found something better! ''[dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!'' Puh- pussy! Pussy! Cock! Shit!  Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls!  ...Cocksucker! Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls! But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say. Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. ''Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look]'' Shit! Butthole!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface! Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition. ...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble. Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle. Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy!  Dicktits! Shit! Asshole!  Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness. Tampon! Tampon DICKshit! Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE. Kyle please! I'm sorry! That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina! Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle. You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it? Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fag Jew! Jew bitch! Thank you. Big-nosed kike!  Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!   Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.  Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?  Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy. Then the game is on, Kyle.  Uhh nuh-nothing... Hm. That was... weird.  And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  What the hell is going on? No hey ut what, what I ''meant'' to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh,    Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say? Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it!  Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!  Ah, I need to be going now.   Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show. My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine. No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.  But I'm not gonna do the- I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show? You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say. No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!   How does he do that? Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you ''especially'' can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle. Kyle? Kyle, what are you doing? Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle! I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man! You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!
