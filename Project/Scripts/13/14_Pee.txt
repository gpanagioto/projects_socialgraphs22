On the road, day. Cartman is singing. Jimmy looks over the back of the second row of seats in the station wagon.

Cartman


We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park!
We're going to the water park,
Me and all my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like!
[Kyle flashes a look of anger at him]




Stan

[annoyed] Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. [his father Randy is driving. The other boys present are Butters, Kenny, and Jimmy]

Cartman

This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.

Butters

What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.

Cartman

No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.

Jimmy

W-What are you talking about, Eric?

Cartman

You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.

Stan

We're here! It's the water park! [Randy pulls up at the front entrance and drops the boys off.]

-----


Pi Pi's Splashtown. The boys gather at the entrance.

Randy

I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4:00, you got it?

Cartman

Come on, let's go!

Stan

We got it, Dad.

-----


The ticket booth.

Cartman

[hands the clerk some money] Six adorable children, please.

-----


Inside. Cartman runs in and through the interactive fountains.

Cartman

Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool! [finally gets to the wave pool, but gets pissed off] Oh, what the hell?! [the pool is quite crowded with people of all races enjoying themselves. The other five boys catch up to Cartman]

Kyle

All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?

Stan

Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?

Cartman

[with a stunned look on his face] Forget it! Just forget it! [walks off in anger. The other five are confused]

-----


Pi Pi's New York Splash. The boys tackle that attraction. Cartman isn't with them.

Stan

Dude, this is awesome.

Kyle

You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?

Butters

[stops] Hey fellers, fellas hang on! I've gotta go to the bathroom. [Kenny continues across the pool without the other boys]

Kyle

Okay, go ahead. [turns back to Stan and Jimmy]

Butters

Okay, thanks. [goes to the bathroom right there, no stepping out of the pool or nothin']

Kyle

I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?

Stan

Okay.

Kyle

All right, [glances back at Butters] check it out, I- [looks back again and sees what happened.] Butters, BUTTERS! What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!

Butters

You said "go ahead".

Stan

Come on Kyle, let's check out the fireboats.

Kyle

No dude, Butters' pee is in there.

Stan

Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.

Butters

Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.

Kyle

No they don't!

Stan

Yeah, they do, Kyle.

Jimmy

To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tu-tu-twenty five seconds ago.

Kyle

Dude!

Stan

Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.

Kyle

NO!

-----


In another part of the park, Cartman stands alone near a gazebo as people move past him this way and that. Montage, part 1: Cartman is now in the wave pool, then he wanders around the park, then he's singing at a signpost, then he's back near the wave pool, looking at the crowd in there, then he faces the camera, then he walks back to the park entrance, then tugs at a cop's shirt only to find that the copy is a member of a minority group, then he's back at the signpost, then he's at an artificial beach looking for a place to sit, then he's in line for Pele's Revenge, then he's annoyed and lazing about in an inner tube at the Lazy River, then he's waiting to enter the Lost River of the King Tut.

Cartman


What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go oooooon.

There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.

There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!



-----


At the Zip Line Ride. Cartman is waiting for the car he's in to start moving.

Ride Operator

Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-

Cartman

Just do it in English!

-----


Back to the montage. Cartman walks around some more, then he's back at the wave pool looking at it, then some colored lights in the background, then he's on bended knee on a bluff overlooking the park.

Cartman


There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park

(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).



-----


Pi Pi's Snack Shack, later. The other five boys are eating hamburgers.

Stan

After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?

Butters

You bet!

Kyle

I'm not getting back in the water.

Stan

Aw come on, Kyle.

Kyle

Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?

Stan

Not everybody pees in pools.

Kyle

Do you pee in the pool?

Stan

Not today... yet.

Kyle

Aw, come on!

Stan

Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?

Kyle

Most likely.

Cartman

[running up to the boys] You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!

Stan

Dude, where have you been?

Cartman

I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? And there are a hundred and ninety black people!

Kyle

So what?

Cartman

So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty-three! There are actually more minorities here than us!

Kyle

Well then they're not minorities, are they?

Cartman

...What do you mean?

Kyle

Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!

Cartman

The black and brown people.

Kyle

No, you're the minority!

Cartman

Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year!

Stan

This is more math than I've ever seen you do.

Cartman

Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!

Butters

The who?

Cartman

The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!

Stan

I'm gonna go on the slides.

Butters

Whoopie! [Stan, Butters, Jimmy, and Kenny take their leave]

Cartman

You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on! [only Kyle is left at the table, and Cartman remembers this and slowly turns to him] Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan's prediction from coming true, buddy?

Kyle

Blow it out your ass, Cartman! [leaves the table without taking a bite from his hamburger. He walks by an elderly couple in a pool]

Woman

Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?

Eugene

Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.

Kyle

Eewww! [walks away quickly. Nearby, a man takes a water sample]

Water Tester

Oh my God.

-----


The park's main office. The water tester and his assistant are at the office with Pi-Pi and a lawyer. Behind Pi-Pi is a picture window, and outside that is the Drop Zone!! attraction.

Pi-Pi

Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi-Pi. How can I help you?

Assistant

Pi-Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.

Water Tester

I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now 98% pee.

Pi-Pi

Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?

Assistant

Pi-Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty-three percent. [with some urgency] You have to shut down.

Pi-Pi

What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggest-a weekend. Everyone is having a-theh fun.

Water Tester

You're endangering people's lives! [shows him the test results] If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!

Lawyer

And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?

Water Tester

One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!

Pi-Pi

Gehntlemen, please-a. I come-a from ada Venice. [shows off a real life picture of a canal in Venice] Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee.

Water Tester

You have to evacuate people now!

Lawyer

He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!

Water Tester

[now at the door with his assistant about to leave] If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. [they leave]

-----


The wave pool, later. The water is now green.

Butters

Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!

Stan

This is sweet, huh Kenny? [Kenny, who's facing away from the camera, doesn't say anything. A girl in an inner tube floats past the boys, then stops and lets loose some pee. Sure enough, the ground begins to rumble and shake.]

Jimmy

W-What's that? [Explosions of pee come out of every ride, overrunning them all. A huge pee wave rises over the park and swamps it, destroying every structure. An unlucky slider is swept down in a rush of pee. A woman loses her baby as the wave strikes her back. The pee tsunami sweeps across the Mt. Everest attraction. A statue of a man scaling the mountain falls off]

Woman Who Loses Baby

(shrieks)

Man 1

It's pee! [turns to run from it]

Man 2

Look out for the pee! [Kyle, who's playing a Zombie Fighter video game, looks back to see what's all the commotion. The pee-nami hits the New York Splash attraction, mowing down its structures]

Kyle

Aaaaah! GROSS! [leaves the game and makes a run for it. A volcano blows up and chunks of lava drop all over the place. The wave pool gets unstable, threatening to throw people out with its wild waves]

Pi-Pi

[holding on to the sign post] Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! [the signpost breaks off and both man and post are swept away by the pee. Stan, Butters, and Jimmy climb up the Mr. Everest sign]

Floating Woman

[swept away] Aaaah!

Stan

[in a shaky voice] Aaaah! [stops and looks at the pee, and sees a familiar boy floating in the water, face down] OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED KENNY!

Kyle

[running up some stairs in Drop Zone!!] Aw, sick! [the pee below him is rising]

-----


Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, some time later. Firefighters have arrived on the scene of the destroyed water park.

Fire Marshal

I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. [Randy quickly arrives in his station wagon and runs up to the captain]

Randy

What's going on?

Fire Marshal

I told you people to keep civilians back!

Randy

Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?

Fire Marshal

We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-

Officer 1

Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. [the water tester and his assistant walk into view]

Water Tester

We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.

Fire Marshal

So this is all pee-related?

Water Tester

Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.

Fire Marshal

And?

Water Tester

It was almost all pee, no H.

Randy

Oh my God. I've gotta help him! [starts to run to the gate, but the captain catches him and pulls him back.]

Fire Marshal

Stay BACK!

Randy

You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!

Officer 2

Sir, it's possible with a crane we could help any survivors out.

Water Tester

I think that would be a very bad idea.

Fire Marshal

And why is that?

Water Tester

Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.

Fireman 1

Change how?

Water Tester

All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey. [a researcher wheels in a monkey who's been shackled to a dolly] We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. [unzips his pants and turns to face the monkey, then starts peeing on it. He first pees on the chest, no reaction. He moves the stream up to the monkey's face and the monkey begins to protest. The monkey tries to escape the pee stream, but the tester just keeps the stream on it as best he can.]

Fire Marshal

My God! He's become full of rage!

-----


Back in the pee-filled water park, Jimmy, Butters, and Stan stand on the Mt. Everest attraction. Kyle is on what remains of the Drop Zone!! sign, but it moves a little, sinking a bit.

Kyle

Aahhh...

Stan

[on a small plateau on the attraction] Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!

Kyle

No way!

Jimmy

You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.

Butters

Come on, Kyle!

Kyle

Dude, that's all pee!

Stan

Well if you don't swim in it you're gonna die!

Kyle

I'll die if I do swim in it!

Stan

Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!

Kyle

Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!

Stan

[hesitantly] ...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.

Kyle

..WHAT?

Stan

Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.

Kyle

You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!

Stan

Not... all the time.

Kyle

That is gross!!

Stan

Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!

Butters

Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! [the sign drops further into the yellow urine]

Stan

Kyle, come on!

Kyle

Ah, god-damnit! [climbs down the sign and into the pee. He holds his face high up as much as he can as he swims across] Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, [He climbs up and joins his friends on the plateau. He pants, dripping with pee]

Butters

Do you need to wash your hands?

-----


The lake of pee. Cartman hangs on to a styrofoam ice chest.

Cartman

Help! Help!

Man 1

Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! [a branch hangs off a Floom Zoom boat]

Cartman

Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me! [grabs onto the branch and is hoisted onto the boat. He catches his breath] Oh, oh, oh. [sits up and looks around - it's all minorities in the boat]

Man 2

Are you okay?

Cartman

Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.

Man 2

Well what are we gonna do now?

Woman 1

We've gotta just wait it out.

Woman 2

Yeah, but for how long?

Man 3

We need to find somethin' to paddle with.

Cartman

[pulls out a memo pad and pen and writes the following] Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what's on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live. [puts the pad and pen away somewhere...] Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. [the other survivors just look at him]

-----


The Marsh house. Sharon is on the phone in the living room while Shelly looks on from the kitchen doorway.

Sharon

Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.

Randy

It's the pee! It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!

Sharon

What is all pee?

-----


Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot.

Randy

Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.

Sharon

What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!

Randy

I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.

Sharon

Randy, you've got to do something!

Randy

Calm down, Sharon, all right?! [shakes his head vigorously] Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.

Fire Marshal

[on the phone with someone] I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands! [hangs up] Damn it where is that antidote?!

Researcher 1

[with red hair] Here! Here! We think we have it, sir! [three researchers walk into view] It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine.

Fire Marshal

All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys! [three monkeys are wheeled in on dollies]

Water Tester

Let's hope to Christ this works. [each researcher takes a monkey and injects it with the antidote. Then they start pissing on the monkeys, and the monkeys protest almost immediately] No, damn it, no!

Fire Marshal

They're still angry.

Researcher 1

This one's really angry.

Fire Marshal

It's out of control! [quickly takes a gun from a police officer and shoots the middle monkey first, then the one on the left, then the one on the right. All of them die.] Find an antidote that works! [the researchers leave]

-----


Stan, Jimmy, Kyle, and Butters make their way down the Mt. Everest attraction as the pee recedes.

Kyle

Dude, why the hell aren't people coming to help us?

Stan

I don't know. [they hear the sobs of a crying man nearby]

Pi-Pi

Why? Why didn't Pi-Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi-Pi, but-a the Pi-Pi not-a belieeve them. [sobs some more. The boys approach him]

Stan

Who are you?

Pi-Pi

[stands up and faces them] Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee.

Kyle

Yeah, well people should [looks at Stan and Butters] know that peeing in pools is [looks at Jimmy] bad!

Pi-Pi

But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi-Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open it, all this pee can be lowered.

Jimmy

Okay. W-where's the maintenance room?

Pi-Pi

That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi-Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? [Stan, Butters and Jimmy all look at Kyle, who looks back at them]

Kyle

[spreads his arms in refusal] NO!

Butters

You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.

Kyle

Not in pee!

Pi-Pi

[grabs Kyle by the left wrist and pulls him away from his friends] Please-a you have to hurry! [lets go] I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.

Kyle

[looks back at the other boys] Oh who pees in the shower?!

Stan

...Well, it's not like if you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.

Butters

Well yeah, seeing all that running water always makes me need to pee.

Kyle

You don't pee in the shower, dude. That's fucking disgusting!

Pi-Pi

Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!

Kyle

Jesus Christ!

-----


Adrift in the Floom Zoom on Pi Pi Lake. Cartman whips out his memo pad and starts writing again.

Cartman

It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... [imagines himself in class with a bunch of non-white students]

Teacher

[A black man] All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report.

Cartman

I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.

Teacher

Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!

Cartman

...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.

Teacher

Good.

Cartman

Noooo... [now imagines himself at a job interview] Trying to find a job will be even harder.

Señor Lopez

You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?

Cartman

Well, I do just as much work.

Señor Lopez

[laughs] You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.

Cartman

Noooo... [now imagines himself at an open council meeting] Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.

Councilman

All those in favor of putting white people in camps?

Audience

Aye!

Councilman

All those opposed?

Cartman

Noooo...

Councilman

The minorities win! [Cartman comes out of his daydream]

Cartman

[throws down his pad and pen and stands up] NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! [turns away and squeezes his eyes shut.]

-----


The Mt. Everest attraction. Pi-Pi prepares Kyle for the descent to the basement. Kyle holds a piece of white paper and an index card.

Pi-Pi

Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi-Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.

Kyle

Let's just get this over with!

Pi-Pi

You've got-a the map and-a Pi-Pi's instructions?

Kyle

Yes.

Pi-Pi

Good-a. Now just one last thing. [takes a glass jar sitting next to him and scoops some pee into it] You need to drink-a some pee.

Kyle

What?!

Pi-Pi

You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.

Kyle

Why?!

Pi-Pi

You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.

Stan

That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?

Kyle

[drops the papers on the ground] I am not, NOT, d-rinking pee!

Pi-Pi

But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!

Stan

Just drink the pee, Kyle.

Butters

Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.

Pi-Pi

What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!

Kyle

That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.

Pi-Pi

Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.

Kyle

No!

-----


Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, afternoon.

Water Tester

Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.

Researcher 2

[balding, with gray hair] Wait, you mean a banana.

Water Tester

Yes.

Fire Marshal

Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey! [another monkey is brought forth strapped to a dolly] All right, Connors. [Officer connors offers a banana to the monkey, who takes a bite of it after a few seconds. A researcher steps up and starts peeing on the monkey. The monkey doesn't mind it, but just takes another bite of the banana.]

Fireman 2

Holy God, it works!

Police Captain

All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-

Water Tester

Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.

Randy

I'll do it. [the officers and firefighters make way for Randy.] You can test the antidote on me. [two researchers take Randy and sit him down in the dolly, then strap him in.]

Fire Marshal

[walks up to Randy] You sure you want to do this?

Randy

Give me the banana. [the balding researcher walks to him and gives him the banana. Randy takes a bite. The fire marshal unzips his pants and starts peeing on Randy's face.] Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh. [tries his best to keep his cool, but shakes his head] Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.

Researcher 3

He looks agitated...

Randy

Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.

Fire Marshal

He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun! [Stevens moves to hand his gun to the fire marshal]

Randy

No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.

Water Tester

He's all right!

Fireman 3

The banana worked!

-----


The Mt. Everest attraction. Kyle is still up top holding the glass of pee, not daring to drink it.

Stan

Come on, dude!

Kyle

I'm thinking about it!

Jimmy

Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.

Pi-Pi

There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW! [Kyle begins to drink it, then stops]

Kyle

Gah, ah. [swallows once more] Gaagh.

Pi-Pi

Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.

Butters

You can do it, Kyle!

Kyle

Aaahh. Well- [gulps down the rest of the glass and throws the glass away] AAAAH! [the glass breaks on a boulder off screen]

Pi-Pi

All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a- [some helicopters are heard approaching]

Butters

[points to them] Hey look! [the helicopters are shown. Randy looks out from one of them]

Randy

[waving a small red shoe] Stan! [steps aside so the firefighters can drop down a rope ladder]

Stan

All right, they finally came for us. [he, Butters and Jimmy have wide smiles]

Kyle

[pissed off] ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! [more rope ladders drop down from the other helicopters as the rescuers cheer]

-----


Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, afternoon. Paramedics check out the survivors. The camera pans right to show Randy walking with Kyle, Stan, Jimmy, and Butters.

Randy

[stops] Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. [walks away]

Cartman

Guys? Guys! [walks into view and hugs Stan] Oh it's true! You all did survive!

Butters

Hawww, you lived?

Cartman

Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?

Kyle

That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot.

Cartman

It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!

Kyle

Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!

Stan

Aw come on. It was just a little pee, Kyle.

Kyle

Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!

Water Tester

Stevens

[cocks his gun and aims at Kyle] Eat the banana or we have to put you down!

Kyle

[frustrated] AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!
