A reindeer? How dare she talk to us like that?! TP her house? Oh. Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious. You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman? Oh.  Uuugh. Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside. So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it! We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man! What have we done?  We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble. How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them ''days'' to clean that up! Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman! Noo! No.   Ah! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house? I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality Ah, Ah I, ah I thought... Why are they doing us one at a time?  I can get a better deal? Noo! No.   I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.  Oh. Okay. Thanks. Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now. What's this all about, Cartman? A boat ride? Well, okay. Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters. I don't know what to do.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?! Cartman! You wanna kill me?! Fine!  They did? Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense. You con-fessed?  You guys, we can't let him do this! Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house. Because it was- I still feel bad, Cartman Yeah. That makes it even worse. I know. We feel bad for other people. You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streibel. We have something we need to tell you. We have to confess that we were the ones that- Cartman?? That's not fair! But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience! This was supposed to be ''my'' story! ''My'' coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair! Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now. Oh Jesus!  You just feel bad for your''self'' that you're in detention! Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
