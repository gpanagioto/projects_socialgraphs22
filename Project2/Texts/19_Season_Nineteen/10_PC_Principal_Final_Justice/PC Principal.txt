Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others.  An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father?  You wouldn't believe me if I told you.  I don't know what they are, but they used me and others like me to try and change this planet. Huh, ain't that a peach? HEY LESLIE!  Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species.  The bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who don't is that we have the burning desire for social justice. We are at war, but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding, non-biased, and politically correct as possible.
