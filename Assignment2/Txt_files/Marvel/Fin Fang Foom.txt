==Publication history==
[[File:Strange Tales no. 89 (October 1961) cover.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The character makes his debut on the cover of ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #89 (Oct. 1961). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Debuting in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #89 (Oct. 1961) during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Fin Fang Foom appeared during [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Atlas Comics (1950s)#"pre-superhero Marvel|"pre-superhero" period]], which would not become integrated into Marvel's mainstream fictional continuity until the 1970s.

Writer-editor [[Stan Lee]]'s inspiration for the character's name was the title of the [[Chu Chin Chow (1934 film)|1934 movie version]] of the long-running British stage musical ''[[Chu Chin Chow]].'' As Lee described in 2005:
{{blockquote|When I was a kid, I loved going to the movies. When I say a kid, I mean 10, 11, 12 years old. And there was one movie I'd seen. I remember nothing about it except the name. It took place in China, I believe, and the name of the movie was ''Chu Chin Chow''. Now I have no idea what it meant — I don't know if it was somebody's name or a country or a city, but I never forgot that name. Those three words just stuck in my memory: Chu Chin Chow. So when I was looking for the name of a monster, I remember Chu Chin Chow... and that particular meter, that beat, somehow led to Fin Fang Foom.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview! | journal = [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | volume=3 | issue = #104 | page = 21 |date = August 2011 }}</ref> (transcript of 2005 interview)}}

The character first appeared in the standalone story "Fin Fang Foom" in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #89 (Oct. 1961) where a Nationalist Chinese scholar Chan Liuchow awakened Fin Fang Foom and tricked him into destroying a Communist Chinese invasion force of Taiwan. Fin Fang Foom reappeared in ''Astonishing Tales'' #23-24 (April and June 1974) where he battled [[It! The Living Colossus]]. He was impersonated by the Midgard Serpent in ''Thor'' #379 (May 1987). His first story was reprinted in ''[[Fantasy Masterpieces]]'' #2 (April 1966), ''[[Where Monsters Dwell]]'' #21 (May 1973) and ''Marvel Monsterworks'' (1990). Foom, as well as his opponent, Chan Liuchow, eventually reappeared in Marvel continuity in ''Legion of Night'' #1-2 (Oct. 1991), and then made multiple appearances in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #261 - 264 (Oct. 1990 - Jan. 1991); 267 (April 1991) and 270 - 275 (July-Dec. 1992), and returned in ''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #15-18 (April–July 1999).

An alternate version appears in ''Mutant X Annual'' 2001. Foom briefly appeared in the [[intercompany crossover]] ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 2003). The villain Nightmare changed a creature called a Mindless One into a copy of Foom to battle the Hulk in ''Hulk'' vol. 3 #79 (May 2005).

The character's origins and early days are developed in ''Marvel Monsters: Monsters On The Prowl'' #1 (Dec. 2005) and ''[[Fin Fang Four]]'' #1 (Dec. 2005).

==Fictional character biography==
It is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that Fin Fang Foom is an alien being from the world of Kakaranathara (also known as Maklu IV) in the Maklu star-system of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud|Greater Magellanic Cloud]]. The aliens arrive on Earth in [[China]] nearing the end of its ancient periods, intending to conquer the planet. Because  of them, the [[Chinese dragon]]s symbolize potent and auspicious powers in  [[Chinese culture|culture]], allowing monarchs, especially  [[Emperor of China|emperors]], to claim the banner "[[Son of Heaven|Sons of Heaven]]" since [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]]. In time, during the [[Qin dynasty]], their presences signal the beginning of the country's imperial periods. Using their natural shapeshifting powers to mimic human form, the aliens infiltrate human society to study it before beginning their conquest. Foom, the navigator, is the exception and, acting as a reserve, is placed in a tomb in a catatonic state.<ref>''Iron Man'' #274 (Nov. 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime during the early [[Qing dynasty]], Fin Fang Foom attacked the [[Tianjin|Tianjin Prefecture]] for constructing the governor's mansion on top of the land's [[Ley lines|dragon lines]], but was thwarted by [[Zheng Zu]] and the [[Five Weapons Society]].<ref>''Shang-Chi'' vol. 1 #1 (Sept. 2020). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 1960s, Fin Fang Foom is awakened by a scholar Chan Liuchow, whose homeland of Taiwan is under threat from invading forces of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]]. Liuchow goads the dragon into chasing him into the Communist invasion force which Foom destroys and then back to Fin Fang Foom's tomb, where the creature is returned to sleep via the use of a rare herb.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1960-64 |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490458 |page=45}}</ref><ref>''Strange Tales'' #89 (Oct. 1961). Marvel Comics.</ref> The mad scientist Doctor Vault locates and mentally controls the dragon for use against Vault's foe, [[It, the Living Colossus]]. Fin Fang Foom resists the control and aids the Colossus against an alien invasion by the [[gargoyle]]s of the planet Stonus V (intent on preserving Earth for the gargoyles to conquer at a later date), then briefly battles the Colossus before being freed from Vault's control and returning to hibernation once again.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #23-24 (April and June 1974).

Marvel Comics.</ref> The Mandarin is directed to the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon by a man called Chen Hsu, who is actually the captain of Foom's vessel. The Mandarin finds and wakes Fin Fang Foom, using the dragon to threaten the Chinese government. Fin Fang Foom helps the Mandarin take control of one-third of China, and is then revealed as an alien of Kakaranathara. With "Chen Hsu", whose true form is also revealed, the pair begin to summon the rest of the crew, who had been disguised as humans for centuries. Realizing he has been tricked, the Mandarin joins forces with heroes [[Iron Man]] and [[War Machine]] to defeat the dragons, the battle ending with their apparent annihilation.<ref>''Iron Man'' #261 - 264 (Oct. 1990-Jan. 1991); 267 (April 1991) and 270-275 (July-Dec. 1992).

Although Fin Fang Foom's body is destroyed, the alien's spirit survives and bonds itself to a small dragon statue, which was stolen from a curio shop by teenager Billy Yuan at Fin Fang Foom's mental urging. Using Yuan's body as a conduit for his power, Fin Fang Foom summons thousands of lizards from the sewers beneath New York, merging them with Yuan's body to recreate his own form. Iron Man, however, defeats Foom with assistance from the last remnants of Yuan's mind.
