Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip. How can you guys say stuff like that? I know, but-- I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside. Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks. Thanks, you guys. Hi, guys. People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday. Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there! All right, then. There's a flight leaving today. Hi guys. I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like? Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine. Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch. I'm Bob. But my friends call me "Ugly Bob", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim. You can? Did you say, "hostile takeover of Canada"? God bless you, Phillip.  
Hey. Hey there.  The name's Ugly Bob. Oh, the giant! Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh? Who? The Native Canadians? He says that the taking of the princess was foretold. He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger threat to Canada who has the princess. He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it. Aw, leave the kid alone, Scott. Don't worry. If there's one thing Eskimos are good at, it's finding things. Wait a minute.  Of course! The evil Atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay! It's coming for me! Help! 
Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip. How come you guys say stuff like that?
