You bastards! It looks like a UFO. Dude, it can't be cooler than mine. Ha ha, you look like a pansy. What uh, what are you supposed to be? Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude? No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume. Wow! Cool! Cartman! What kind of costume is that? No it's not cool! Hehe. Sissy. You forgot to wear a costume Kenny. Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny? Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... Everyone came as Chewbacca?! Dammit! Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass! Wookies don't live on Endor! Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine! I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else! I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy. Aren't you hungry Kenny?  Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal. Check this out! I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine! Dude, I thought she was dead. What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! Hey dudes. Check. What's that? You still didn't get a costume Kenny? Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains. If everyone is turned into zombies... Chef, you've gotta help us! Yeah, I'm scared. I found it! I found it! See Cartman, your mom is on the cover. Chef!!! But the zombies are coming! There's a bunch of zombies here! Uh, okay. Then what? Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?! Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary. Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard! It's working! They're turning back to normal. Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us. ...No, dude, that's Christmas. Costumes and candy. We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
