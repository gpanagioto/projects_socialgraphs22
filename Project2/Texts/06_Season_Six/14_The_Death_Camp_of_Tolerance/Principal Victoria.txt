Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade. I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you. As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job. We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that. I know you will.   It's for real, Mr. Garrison. With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars. Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.  Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.  Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please? Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat. Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods. No no no we're not firing you. No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar. You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class? I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef. No, no, I think I have a better idea. I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.
