You told me to finish my homework! I know. I'm wearing green.   Hello? Dad, it's me. You called the wrong person. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Stop who? Yeah, Tol-l-l-kien is sitting right here. I don't care. Okay, what do you want me to do? Dad, it's St. Patrick's Day. We're gonna do a scavenger hunt at recess. Hey, there, we brought you a cake.  God dammit. You... You should just enjoy the cake. Well, see ya.
