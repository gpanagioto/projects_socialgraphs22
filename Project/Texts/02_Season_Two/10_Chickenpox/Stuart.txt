Yeah? What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--? Oh yeah. We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. Lord, we thank you for this ''staggering'' payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been ''faith''ful to you, we ''know'' that you ''will'' send us some good fortune ''one'' of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen. So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But ''he'' got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's ''Jewish''! Hey, is it ''my'' fault you don't know how to cook?! You just don't know how to use spices and stuff. Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole! I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry. Tackle box? When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless. Beer? Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.  That's where I live now. Not that easy. You were lucky. You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.  I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver ''enema'' up my ass! Now don't make me do that again! Uh! Oh! Eeaagghh! Aww hell, I'm sorry, too.
