What?? 
Just ready to party farty, witches.   I mean it! I got this spell book last month. Got it in Salem, Massachusetts. They say it's real. Like from the Devil himself. You guys wanna try it? Arkna. Peduum. Uthnod boral. Uthnod boral! Uthnod alvernderaal! Wickus!  Stayfalls-wuh. Uh. Ach. Oh, it burns! I'll kill you all! Kill you all!   Well, well. What have we here?  Hey, what's up, bros? Yeah, so? I'm a witch. Of course they do. You're all witches too, dudes! They're all in here! See?  I'm going to use their souls to increase my power! Oh, give me a break, Randy. Like if one of you guys had the power I have, you wouldn't use it. Oh, hey man!  I grow more powerful every moment!
