 What? Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.  Hi Mom, Hi Dad! I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen!   Thanks. Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual. I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.  Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around? Stan?  No! Ah!  I got beat up at school... for being different. No! For not being a metrosexual. Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too? Gah! Just leave me alone!  GRRRRR!! That does it! I know what I have to do!  One ticket to New York, please. I'm going to see the ''Queer Eye For the Straight Guy'' people. Mrrh. Mr. Garrison? I'm going to New York to kill the ''Queer Eye For the Straight Guy'' people! Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first! I thought of it first! Did so! Did so! I thought of it two days ago! Cool. Clear! They aren't gay? Then what are they? AAAAAAAAAAAAH! You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy! No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help! Mom! What? Y-you want me to hang out with you? No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened? God-damnit!
