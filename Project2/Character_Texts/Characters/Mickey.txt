Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha. The rings stay on!  Now, do we have a problem?! Haha. Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha.   In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D. Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings.

You're telling me, haha, that I'm losing Chinese customers because of some shithead that's not even from MY company?! It's like, it's like they didn't even wanna listen. It's the bear. They're still pissed off about the bear. 'Cause some Chinese people on the Internet starting posting pictures of their President as Winnie the Pooh. It's a real thing. Look it up.
