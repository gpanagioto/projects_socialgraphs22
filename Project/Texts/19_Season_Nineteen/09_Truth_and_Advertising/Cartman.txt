 Oh, my fucking God... I'm so bored, dude. I am not your slave, Kyle.  PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle! Have fun, dude. Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out? How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties. How does it do that? That movie's gonna suck dude. Eating ice cream, dipshit. And then Tolkien tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead.  Didn't we finish doing that? Why isn't anyone looking at me? Stan's calling you a traitor. I am loving this right now. Hoh that's low.  Fight!
