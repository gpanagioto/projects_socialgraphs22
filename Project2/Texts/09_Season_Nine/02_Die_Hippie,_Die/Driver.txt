 Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place. Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world? We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich. Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told.  You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind. Well, so my idea was this: Let's have, like, a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Who was ''that''? Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed. You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.
