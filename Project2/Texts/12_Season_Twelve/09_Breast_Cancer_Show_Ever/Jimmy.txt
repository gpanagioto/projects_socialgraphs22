Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya. I'll bet she is! As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight.  Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early. Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ!  I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls. Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
