This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time. UFO's?  That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. That, that was a pigeon. There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.  Hold it right there, cows! Come back here! Now then!  Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. 
Nice Gun. Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet. No problem. Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee! What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute.  Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!  Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat? You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt. 
Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. OK, any questions? That's enough out of you! This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here. 
You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -  Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here. 
Carry on. 
You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.  Not a thingy-dingy. Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle? Righty-o. 
Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos. Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister. 
What? Yyess. 
What seems to be the problemo here? Boys, shouldn't you be in school? No excuses, move along, you little troublemakers! Well what? Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass! Hoh, what a bitch! 
Huh?! Where?! 
Oh my God, look! Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking. Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction. Whoa, this is a good movie! Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too.  Wooo! The short what? Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost? 
Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong. There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town! Goddammit! Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body? Uhhhh... oh. Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect? Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys? Haw, camel poo. Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it! Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed. I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people. How about fishing without a license? Whataya call this then? If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you...  by gunshot to the head. That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget. ''For''-get. Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalape√±o poppers. What's that? I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot? Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie! Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established. Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet. All right, all right! I can't read! There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! I need to go poopies. Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it? Ahhh... O... O-- Ahhh... O...  Did you kids actually learn how to read this way? Haa haa. Ha ha ha. I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, ''Go, Dog. Go!''. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.  Hooray! <poem><i>Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...</i></poem>  Oooh, pretty good. Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chicken''lover''. Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken? Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's. I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report. Oh boy, I'm in big trouble. I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos. Hey, that's right. You ''can'' help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis. You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. Sure, nightsticks for everybody! You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case. Now, what did that clue say again? To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare! We need a copy of ''Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft'' right away! Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word?  Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--" That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately! Oh, weak, dude! We're too late! Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.   "Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame! Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo. It is, too! "Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--" "Pet--" Wait a minute.  Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off! Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. Oh, no! Shhh! Keep your eyes peeled. Grab him! I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon! Oh. Caught you red-handed! By reading ''Teetle the Timid Taxidermist''. Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?" No, no, that's ''not'' how you uphold the law!  Thank you, everybody. Thank you.  What? Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  reading totally sucks ass! Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: ''Atlas Shrugged'', by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!  Thanks, boys. 
 I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat. Oh?  Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow. I found him. Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all. 
That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys. Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up? Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong. Oh, yeah. Let's go. Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator. Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. Okay, I'll be quick, then. Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef. Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too. That would be super-duper! Oh, neato! Who? Pain.  Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?  Holdjit If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?  Odle-oh who whoo?  Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business.  Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor. 
What's all the hoo-ha? Why? If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just. What do you have to say, carnival operator? Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started! Barbrady! You said Buttbaby. Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. What's all this? Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people? Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans? Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans! All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh?  Yeah. Uh me, too. I didn't? Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison. 
What's this all about? Can I go now?  Weirdo. 
Well, there's been a report of a few missing people. Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them.  No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though? Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?   Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions. Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then. Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor. No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here. 
The usual. 
Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here. Oh, yeah. There is that.   Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man. All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch ''Murphy Brown''.  
 Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur‚Ä¶ 
Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants. Who are you? Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.  Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI. Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!  Wow, they've got activists for everything these days. 
Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking. 
Well okay. Next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?! These are a weapon!  I'll think of a way. Now move along! Alright, next!  
Uh what the hell was that? 
Hello, Mrs. Marsh. Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property. Me?? How did ''I'' get into this mess? I am. But I don't want to be. The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out. Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator. But isn't that dishonest? Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you. What do you mean? 
Crime scene investigation!   Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence. You?! So where were you last night at around 9?! Aha!! Got you! Insurance?  Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening. No I do not. I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think. Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police. I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case? Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return? You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.  Well, that's kind of personal. Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know. So you think there was more than one. Why? Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt!  Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  Is this toilet paper from your store?  Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days? Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern. Josh, I need your help. How do you mean? Yes. No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you? To get revenge. What do you mean? I don't have time for this, kid. Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps!  Oh. Of course! One of her students! Hello boys. How are you? It sure is! Right over here.  Why do you say that? All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by. Huh?? Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now.  Excuse me, everyone.  Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please? Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation.  Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no! Couldn't you have gone after him? Police station. Josh? Josh, where are you?! Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence. 
 Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed! 
There you are! Eric Cartman, you are under arrest. I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement. Oh no, you're coming downtown!  You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement. I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz. Yeah. 
Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer? Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside. Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that. Why? Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex. Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point. Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody. You're welcome, Jim.  Wait... 
Oh God. 
Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here!  
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't-  
 these three boys were caught playing hooky. 
Yeah, the food is unbelievable.  
 
You don't know the half of it. The gun show? The entire town in one location?  Oh my God! They've become sentient, they've taken human form. You can't tell what's human and what's an ad anymore.
