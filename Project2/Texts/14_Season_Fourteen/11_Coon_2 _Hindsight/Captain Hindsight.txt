What's the skinny? Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it. And then you see that building to the left? They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to.  What seems to be the problem?  Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling? It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill! Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.  Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve! My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need! Please, sit down. What can I do for you?  Of what? Go ahead. Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened. Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner! Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse. Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone. Get this kid out of here! I have to think! I can't help anyone right now! Something came up. Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk? Look at those photos on the desk.  'Course it's Courtney Love! I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening! I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-
