Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work? Told you a long time ago: I gave that up.   It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house.  No thanks to you. Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?! Protect it yourselves this time. Then you should have no problem covering it up.   Alright, fine. There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy!  If only I could have saved the sheep herder.
