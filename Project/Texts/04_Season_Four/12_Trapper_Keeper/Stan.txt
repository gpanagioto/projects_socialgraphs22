Dude, what's your little brother doing here? But isn't he only three years old? Cool! Wow, cool! Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus. But they smell like pee. Aren't you a little old to be in grade school? Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours? Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid. Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper!   What the hell just happened? Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby? Wow, that's amazing. What do you think, Officer Barbrady? Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity! Yes! So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby? Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper! Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before! Cartman! Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait! Can I do it?  Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy! Well, yeah, or we could just kill him. He's right there. Uh-oh. Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves.    ''You'' break it down! Not it! You lose, Kenny.  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Then we have to stop it before it gets there!  Cartman, you have to stop! He ''is'' in there. One-two-three, not it! Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to. No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell.  This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened! He did it! You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass! Huh, that's a bitch. Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you! Cartman!
