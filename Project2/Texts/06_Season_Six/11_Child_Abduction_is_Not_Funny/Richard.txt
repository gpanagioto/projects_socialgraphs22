Sit down and have some coffee, son.  Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about children being abducted, and we thought we should talk. Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. It's important for ''you'' to know never to unlock them at night for ''anyone'' except your mother and I. You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I? He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest. Did he hurt you, son? That's... not a bad idea, a city wall. Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell!  Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?  Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now.  'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here. Well, maybe things would be better if we could ''trust'' people like the Stotches! Oh yeah?!  Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey! Where are you going? Oh?  I think I'll go with you. I just want to make sure that you- Me? I would never abduct our son!  Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children.  Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are. They're starting to remember. We're sorry, Tweek! Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along. The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.
