But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend! But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I? I don't want your lame-ass supper!   Okay, let's go! 'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry! So, how far is it to Nebraska? Yeah. Or, we could ''not''. This is Nebraska?  Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?  He's the ''fat'' one. Sick, dude.  Yeah, right! My family's dead!  They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.  Dude, is he here every year like this? Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here. What, dude?  Kyle, we ''are'' in a house filled with Cartmans. What was that? I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming.  We thought you were in jail.  Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall. ''All'' families suck ass! Do you really think we should go with this guy? Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go. I really like that guy.  You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you. Oh, boy. You've done it now. Where did you go, Uncle Charlie? Hey. Where's Kenny? Oh, hey Kenny. There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us! Oh ooh.  ...Sorry.  Dude, they're gonna kill me.  'Scuse me. I wanna go with you. Please, I don't wanna go back with them. I ''know''! They've come to ''punish'' me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the ''first'' place. What?! But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.  I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom. Really? Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What? Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
