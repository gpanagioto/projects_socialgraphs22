We will defend our ninja honor!  Hey guys, did you come to see our ninja fortress? Yeah, with Clyde and David too.  It is a great honor to see that you all want to be ninjas. Joining our club is very serious. You must promise to uphold the warrior's code.  Together we must strive to make our fortress super bad-ass and keep all intruders out! To that end, let us proceed to our training. Wait, he said this was gay? You guys! You guys! Actual Ninjas. Wanna talk to us. Kenny and I both just got the same email from people overseas. All those in favor of Cartman being kicked out of our ninja club?
