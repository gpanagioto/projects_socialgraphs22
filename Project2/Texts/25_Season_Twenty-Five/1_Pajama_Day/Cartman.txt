This is bullshit! They can't take our pajamas from us! Who does the principal think he is?! We didn't do fucking anything wrong! We keep not doing anything wrong, and we keep getting fucked! Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. We are not just going to stand for this?! Brah, we can have some Goddamn balls! What does Matt Damon say on that Bitcoin commercial? Fortune favors the brave. Yes, everyone did. But they were brave in doing so. We have to stand up for ourselves, you guys. I say we go right to the principal's office and tell him what's up, brah.  ''panting]'' Oh, God! I-I was at the school and it– it was pajama day, and I– I didn't have pajamas on and then I died! And then I died! Yeah, get 'em, mom! Tell him to fuck off! No, I can't stay home because you have to go to work because fucking Matt Damon told you fortune favors the brave and now you lost all your fucking money! Fuck yes, mom, that was fucking sweet! Wait, no, I want to wear my fucking pajamas to school! You fucked it up, Mom! Ladies and gentlemen. We have been at war for too long. Yesterday, Wendy Testaburger came to me and said we need to get the boys and girls together to find a solution for pajama day. I was delighted.  We must put our differences aside, because we all want one thing. The right to be in our jam jams this Friday all cozy wozy. Comfy womfy, cozy wozy, the point is, we are getting fucked. That's right. We need all of us. Boys and girls working together. And so together, what are we going to do? Shoot up the school, nice. It's just done a lot. Anything a little more original? That is just the kind of manipulative, psychotic thinking that we needed. But not too brave or else Matt Damon will come and take all our money. "This is really nice"? Aw, God damnit! Fuck yes! It's opposite day!
