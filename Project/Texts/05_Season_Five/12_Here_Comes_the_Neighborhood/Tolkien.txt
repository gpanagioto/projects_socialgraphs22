Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.   Alright!  My family isn't rich. But I... Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park?  I know. But why? All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich. I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart! I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please.  I'm sure.  That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting. Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think? It doesn't matter, Mom. They're ''poor'' people pants.  I sure did. Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart. Here you go.  It's a DVD of the Lion King I only have this. What's a VHS?  Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood! I'm Tolkien. Aah, he's a lawyer. I think. All right!  ...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.  You do? God, that's great! I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  middle-income. Well, they never really had any money. Well I... think that.. they... ...That's ...great. Hi. Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding. Oh. Alright then.  Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms?   This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight? I don't fit in anywhere. Hello, my name is Tolkien. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  Uuuh, yeah. RRrrr!!  Roar!  You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion! Who's Aslan? Are... you... Aslan?  Well, I'm Tolkien Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else. Well, I don't know. What? ...I like jokes a lot. So can I stay? Huuuunh  Aslan. ...I thnk I'm gonna go home now. They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.  ...No thanks. No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.   Jesus, lions suck! Hey guys. You mean, you ''want'' me around? Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich. That's right, huh? You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich. You're not?
