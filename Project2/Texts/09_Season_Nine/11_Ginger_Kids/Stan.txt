Dude, what's the big deal?  What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger. I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes. You buying school lunch today? That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger. Sure, for what? Okay dude, knock him out.  All right, let's do it. You mean,you're a ginger? Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time.  Should we tell him the truth? Huh? Why? ... totally. You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night. You guys... need... anything?  More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home. The hell do they want?  Run, dude, run!! Kyle. Kyle, wake up. I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton. Cartman?
