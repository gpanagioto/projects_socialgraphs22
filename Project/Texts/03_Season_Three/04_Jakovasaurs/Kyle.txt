This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Just go behind a tree. Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen! You just squat, stupid!  Watch out for ground eels!  What do you have to ''think'' about? No way, dude! What?  Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it! Over here! It just ran by here a second ago.   It's stupid. You don't like anything, Cartman!  Did you smoke some of your mom's crack? What are we supposed to do with him?  Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?! What are you doing, fatass?! They want you to have sex, God-damnit!! Shut up!! Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby. Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was.  Gross! Dude, this sucks ass! We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.  That must be of the antelope family. Cartman! Wait! Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
