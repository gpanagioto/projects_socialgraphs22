Hello. How are you today? I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation... 
You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus. 
He's right.  
 
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped. 
Wow, those people over there seem like they're havin' fun.  
This is seriously as good or better than a real hamburger. Can I get a couple more to take to work?
