Aaaaa Bebe! 
Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all?  Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about?  Well? Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my-- Yes. Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!  Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size. Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now. 
 
You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.  Slut. 
The Jeffersons? 
Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit? 
"Who's Paris Hilton?" She's totally spoiled and snobby.  It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're ''all'' stupid spoiled whores! Yeah, and you get straight A's in school! You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play ''Spin the Bottle'', and ''Two Minutes In The Closet'', and do ketamine. Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is. Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party. I wanna do him. Yeah, they're invited too. Yeah, you said it.   Yeah? Who invited you? Kelly who?  Kelly Rutherford-Menskin? Did you invite him?  Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter? Shut off the light. Paris is gonna rock his world. Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore. 
Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute. Three. Now blue! Aw dangit! Who's Butters? Where do you buy your clothes? I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it.  I will.  Yeah. I can tell ''your'' future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek. Marjorine, why don't you just leave? Nobody wants you here! He yMarjorine, you wanna know your future? 
I wanna know who it was, too. 
If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse? You thought you should be number one? Oh, hey Wendy.  Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.  
 
I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody. 
Not a cheat if you rank up. 
Oh God, that show is so dumb. What happened? God, they're annoying! You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants. 
Hey hey, you guys leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist. 
Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy? 
Good for you, Stan, nice somebody in this school has some balls. Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls. Butters? Your grandma's looking for you. She said to meet her outside behind the school. Good for you, Stan.  You made us look like uncaring idiots! 
So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us. About Tolkien? Why? Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea. That boy Tolkien. 
 
How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?! 
Red! Here we go. Yeah, Lisa has a crush on Butters. Red! Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore. Red! That's right! 
What the hell is that?!   Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!  Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes! Wendy, just go with it!  Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I- ...Wendy? 
All boys should die! Yeah, everyone knows you're the worst! 
No worries. We're just glad you finally came to your senses. Uhh, yeah, like what? Racism? Can you imagine? Eric Cartman's breath on your mouth? 
Stupid assholes!
