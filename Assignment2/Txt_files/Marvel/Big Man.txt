'''Frederick Foswell Jr''' is the son of the Frederick Foswell and the brother of Janice Foswell. He took over the role to gain revenge for the death of his father and sister, which, owing to [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s then-hostile attitude towards Spider-Man, he blamed on the webslinger. Using one of [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s Murderworlds, Foswell Jr. attacked them with [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Life Model Decoy]]s of [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], and replicas of the [[Spider-Slayers]]. Piloting a giant robot version of Big Man, he attacked Spider-Man and Jameson, assuming Jameson would help kill Spider-Man. Spider-Man and the remorseful Jameson quickly defeated Foswell Jr. as Spider-Man hurls the Big Man robot outside before it can self-destruct. Foswell Jr. is then arrested by the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #11-13 (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref>
