  What is that? You know, I've had it! You four boys ''never'' take art class seriously!  You think art is not important?  I certainly can! I'm your teacher! Make it two hours! Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished! 
And so this shape with four sides is what, class? What are you doing?! I don't think that's really necessary. That's enough, class!  Ike, I'm very flattered, by all of your love notes, but I need to be clear. See, there've been a lot of female teachers on the news lately who have been having relationships with young male students and, people might get the wrong idea, even though... I do admire you. You are so smart and gifted. Soo mature for your age. You listen, and you really care about what I have to say. You make me feel things I've never...  That was unbelievable. I've never felt like such a woman before. They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't let anybody know; they'll never understand.  OOOH!  Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught.  Hold on, please, you don't understand. Your brother and I... are in love. Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it! He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle- Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?

And what color is the little ball the kittens are playing with?
