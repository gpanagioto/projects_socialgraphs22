Oooh- hey, Kenny. Could you pull over so I can get out? I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.   I'm gonna be sick. Oogh. Ooooogh. Aghh! I'm gotta get outta here! Okay okay, let's get outta here now! Oh, weak. Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here? No way, dude! No.  Oh boy. Bleech! Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.  Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter? Dude! You're a big fatass, ''and'' your mom's a hermapholite!
