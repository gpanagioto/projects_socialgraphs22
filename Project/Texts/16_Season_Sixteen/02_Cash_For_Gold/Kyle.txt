That... was six grand? Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it. Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else! Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere. You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito! Dude, that's terrible! That's the chemical equation for gold? ...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up? Yeah! What does that mean?  Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!" We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa! What's he doing?
