Loki first appeared in ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and has since become an important recurring figure of the MCU; following the original Loki's death in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), a [[Parallel universes in fiction|variant]] of him from an alternate timeline is introduced in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), diverging from the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), headlining the television series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' (2021) alongside [[Sylvie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sylvie]], a female variant of him who he works alongside with in the series.

Loki's character has borrowed a number of characteristics and storylines from across the history of the character in Marvel Comics. As in the comics, Loki has generally been a villain in the MCU, variously attempting to conquer [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] or Earth, and having allied himself with more powerful villains to achieve his aims. He has particular antagonism for his adoptive brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], and is known to variously ally with and then betray Thor and others, and to regularly return from apparent death. In his development through the series, he becomes less of a [[supervillain]] and more of an [[antihero]].

==Concept and creation==
The mythical figure [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] preceded [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in making his first Marvel Comics appearance, depicted in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title [[Timely Comics]]' publication ''[[Venus (comic book)|Venus]]'' No. 6 (August 1949) as a member of the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]]. However, the current version of Loki made his first official Marvel appearance was in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' No. 85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]]. As one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor'', as well as other [[Marvel Universe]] titles such as ''[[Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]],''<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' No. 1 (December 1985)</ref> as well as brief appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' comic series.

Live-action film adaptations of characters in the ''Thor'' comic books were proposed at various times, but did not come to fruition. In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028215225/http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archive-date=October 28, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In 2006, the film was announced as a Marvel Studios production.<ref name="Carle">{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Carle |title=Comic-Con 2006: Marvel Announces Three |work=IGN |date=July 3, 2006 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |access-date=August 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522131009/http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it "to be like a [[superhero]] [[origin story]], but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential.

[[File:Tom Hiddleston (36109110291) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Hiddleston promoting ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' at the 2017 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]
Tom Hiddleston stated that "Loki's like a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/20-last-minute-casting-decisions-completely-changed-mcu/|title=20 Last-Minute Casting Decisions That Completely Changed The MCU|first=Ben|last=Sherlock|publisher=[[ScreenRant]]|date=January 29, 2019}}</ref> Hiddleston stated that he had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because director Kenneth Branagh "wants Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/actor-thom-hiddleston-and-writer-ashley-miller-talk-thor/|title=Actor Thom Hiddleston and Writer Ashley Miller Talk Thor|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=May 30, 2009|access-date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011053206/https://collider.com/actor-thom-hiddleston-and-writer-ashley-miller-talk-thor/|archive-date=October 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Hiddleston also looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki, explaining, "Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills".<ref name="Storm">{{cite news |author=Storm, Marc |title=Tom Hiddleston: Thor's Mischief Maker |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |date=February 7, 2011 |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15145/tom_hiddleston_thors_mischief_maker |access-date=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629000520/http://marvel.com/news/story/15145/tom_hiddleston_thors_mischief_maker |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.

About his character's evolution from ''Thor'' to ''The Avengers'', Hiddleston said, "I think the Loki we see in ''The Avengers'' is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making?

And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant.

With respect to Loki's death at the beginning of ''Infinity War'', Hiddleston expressed the opinion that "it's very powerful he calls himself an Odinson, and that closes the whole journey of Loki and what he can do", also noting that Loki's death demonstrates how powerful Thanos is, setting the stage for the fight against him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/06/25/avengers-infinity-war-loki-fate-death-tom-hiddleston/|title=Tom Hiddleston Confirms Loki's Fate In 'Avengers: Infinity War', Was Told Two Years Ago|website=Marvel|date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>

In [[Loki (TV series)|''Loki'']] (2021), Loki's sex in the series is denoted by the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] as "fluid", in a nod to the character's [[genderfluid]]ity in [[Marvel Comics]] and [[Norse mythology]]. Hiddleston said that the "breadth and range of identity contained in the character has been emphasized and is something I was always aware of when I was first cast 10 years ago...I know it was important to [[Kate Herron]] and [[Michael Waldron]] and to the whole team. And we were very aware, this is something we felt responsible for."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Johnston|first=Dais|title=Is Loki genderfluid?

===Appearance and special effects===
Hiddleston has noted that his transformation into Loki has required dyeing his naturally blond hair and making his naturally ruddy skin appear very pale, stating:

{{blockquote|In making him with this raven black hair and blanching my face of all color, it changes my features. Suddenly my blue eyes look a lot bluer, which lends a severity to my face.

Loki's costume in ''Thor'', designed by Marvel's head of visual development Charlie Wen, adapted elements from the comics while adding elements to give it a futuristic feel, reflecting the treatment of magic in the Thor films as merely highly advanced technology. Like other representations of Asgard, particularly including the costumes of Thor and Odin, it also referenced Norse symbols. Wen stated that he "designed Loki's armor to be more overtly ceremonial than practical", in keeping with the character being more focused on scheming for power than engaging in battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/wacky-loki-design/|title=Loki's First Design in Thor Was Absolutely Wild|first=Kaila|last=Hale-Stern|publisher=[[The Mary Sue]]|date=August 10, 2018}}</ref>

Hiddleston described the horns worn as part of his Loki costume as weighing about 30 pounds, resulting in one instance during the filming of ''The Avengers'' where he asked co-star [[Chris Hemsworth]] to really punch him in the face, because the weight of the horns made it difficult to fake being hit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480759/that-time-chris-hemworth-punched-tom-hiddleston-in-the-face-filming-the-avengers|title=That Time Chris Hemworth Punched Tom Hiddleston In The Face Filming The Avengers|date=September 23, 2019|website=CINEMABLEND}}</ref>

During the ''Loki'' TV series, numerous Loki variants were shown or introduced with varying appearances. With respect to the most prominently featured variant, Sylvie, ''Loki'' costume designer Christine Wada and director Kate Herron planned Sylvie to be "mysterious and somewhat [[androgyny|androgynous]]" in the beginning, avoiding her identity reveal to become "a total play on gender", rather, letting the character evolve on her own "as a strong female lead" without over-sexualization. Sylvie's look represents a character that is "a fighter", can stand on her own, and is prepared to engage in battles and runs. Instead of tailor-made armors usually given to female comic book characters to enhance silhouettes, the costume designer intended to not make distinctions between the male and female clothing in the series. Sylvie's costume include a harem drop-crotch pant, which allowed her to emphasize movement equally to a tight pant or a spandex suit. Wada decided to bring that grounded aspect to Sylvie's look into a storyline with magic elements, stating that "I believe it more that somebody can go fight when they're in a rugged boot more than a pair of high heels... function is such a clear and important thing to reference in all good design."<ref>{{Cite magazine|first=Sydney|last=Bucksbaum|url=https://ew.com/movies/costume-designers-evolving-female-comic-book-characters-black-widow-loki/|title=Hair ties and no heels: The evolution of female superhero costumes is finally here|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 16, 2021|access-date=July 16, 2021}}</ref> In her first appearance, Sylvie wore a broken Loki crown, which she later left behind in the Ark.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Early life ===
{{see|Thor (film)|Glorious Purpose}}
Loki was born a Frost Giant and abandoned as an infant by his father [[Laufey (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Laufey]], only to be found by [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]] during an invasion of the realm of the Frost Giants in [[Jotunheim (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jotunheim]]. Odin used magic to make Loki appear Asgardian and raised him as a son alongside Odin's biological son, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. During his upbringing, Odin's wife [[Frigga (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frigga]] taught Loki how to use magic.

He used these powers throughout his life, constantly tricking his adoptive brother Thor, as well as pulling a heist on Earth under the alias [[D. B. Cooper]]. He was embittered throughout his upbringing, perceiving that he was neglected by Odin in favor of Thor, and thus grew closer to his adoptive mother Frigga instead.

=== Betrayal of Asgard ===
{{see|Thor (film)}}
Hundreds of years later, in 2011, Loki watches as Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]]. This is interrupted by Frost Giants, allowed in to Asgard by Loki, attempting to retrieve an artifact called the Casket, which was captured by Odin in a war centuries before. Loki then manipulates Thor into traveling to Jotunheim against Odin's order to confront Laufey, the Frost Giant leader. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After Odin exiles Thor to Earth, Loki confronts Odin about his parentage, and a weary Odin falls into the deep "Odinsleep" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Warriors Three]], unhappy with Loki, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifrost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|BifrÃ¶st]]â€”the means of traveling between worldsâ€”to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The Destroyer leaves Thor on the verge of death but his sacrifice sees him become worthy of returning from exile and he regains his powers and defeats the Destroyer. Afterward, Thor leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki. In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the BifrÃ¶st, thus proving himself worthy to Odin. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the BifrÃ¶st to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but after Odin rejects Loki's pleas for approval, Loki allows himself to fall into the abyss.

In space, Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]]. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,{{efn|name=Tesseract|Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract is based on the [[Cosmic Cube]] from Marvel comics.<ref name="movieline">{{cite web|url=http://movieline.com/2012/04/30/kevin-feige-on-avengers-marvel-universe-building-and-the-legacy-of-elektra/|title=Marvel's Kevin Feige on Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, Universe-Building, and Elektra|author=Yamato, Jen|publisher=[[MovieLine]]|date=April 30, 2012|access-date=May 3, 2012|quote=But as we were working on them we started to keep track of some things that the writers and filmmakers of one movie were doing anyway and we started to track them and realized that we could utilize those later down the line.

Later, [[Erik Selvig]] is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube. Loki, invisible, prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.

=== Invasion of New York ===
{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}
In 2012, Loki attacks a remote [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] research facility, using a [[Loki's scepter|scepter]] that controls people's minds and which, unknown to him, amplifies his hatred for Thor and the inhabitants of Earth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/loki/on-screen|title=Loki On Screen Powers, Enemies, History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210623210556/https://www.marvel.com/characters/loki/on-screen|url-status=live|archive-date=June 23, 2021|website=[[Marvel.com]]|access-date=June 28, 2021}}</ref> He uses the scepter to brainwash [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] and Dr. [[Erik Selvig]], and steals the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] that ends with Loki allowing himself to get captured. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D. on the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Quinjet|Quinjet]], Thor arrives and takes him away, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. However, Thor eventually takes Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Helicarriers|Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, and Loki kills the agent [[Phil Coulson]] and ejects Thor from the Helicarrier as he escapes. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Stark Tower]] in [[New York City]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion. The [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] arrive and rally in defense of the city. As the Chitauri are ultimately defeated, the Hulk attacks Loki and beats him into submission in the Tower, before Loki is arrested and taken to Asgard.

Loki is captured by the Avengers and brought back to Asgard by Thor to be imprisoned for his crimes on Midgard (Earth) using the Tesseract.

=== Battle with the Dark Elves ===
{{see|Thor: The Dark World}}
In 2013, [[Dark Elves (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dark Elves]] led by [[Malekith (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Malekith]] attack Asgard, searching for [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]], whose body has been invaded by an unearthly force known as the Aether. Malekith and his monstrous lieutenant [[Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Algrim|Kurse]] kill Loki's adoptive mother [[Frigga (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frigga]], who had taught Loki magic. Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who agrees to take Thor to a secret portal to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Svartalfheim|Svartalfheim]], home of the dark elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother. In Svartalfheim, Loki appears to betray Thor, in fact tricking Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki appears to be fatally wounded saving Thor from Kurse, whom Loki was able to kill through trickery. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. After Thor leaves, it is shown that Loki has actually survived and taken Odin's place on the throne, disguised as Odin.

=== Destruction of Asgard ===
{{see|Thor: Ragnarok}}
From 2013 to 2017, Loki rules Asgard disguised as Odin, having kept the real Odin under a spell on Earth. During this time, the disguised Loki sends Sif to Earth on a mission and later banishes her from Asgard.

In 2017, Thor returns to Asgard and discovers Loki's ruse, making Loki reveal himself to the shocked Asgardians. After Loki tells Thor where Odin is, he is taken by Thor back to Earth to New York City. Loki is trapped through a portal by [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] as a threat to Earth, before him and Thor are sent into another portal in to [[Norway]], where they find a dying Odin, who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, [[Hela (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hela]], to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela appears, destroying MjÃ¶lnir to Loki's shock, and forces Thor and Loki from the BifrÃ¶st out into space. Loki lands on the planet [[Sakaar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sakaar]], and quickly ingratiates himself to the ruler of that world, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]]. Thor later crash-lands on Sakaar and is captured by the slave trader [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]], a former member of the ancient order of [[Valkyrior|Valkyries]] defeated by Hela. After convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, they steal a ship with which to escape through a wormhole to Asgard â€“ but not before Loki again attempts to betray Thor, causing Thor to leave Loki behind on Sakaar. However, Loki is found by [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]], [[Miek (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Miek]], and others who join him aboard a large vessel stolen from the Grandmaster called the ''Statesman''. He leads them to return to Asgard and help the Asgardians escape the battle between Thor and Hela's forces, proclaiming himself their savior in the process. During the battle, on Thor's order, Loki goes to Odin's treasure room and places the crown of Surtur in the eternal flame kept there, thus causing an enormous form of [[Surtur (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Surtur]] to appear and destroy Hela and Asgard. In the process of doing so however, he steals the Tesseract from Odin's treasure vault. Thor, crowned king, decides to take the Asgardians to Earth despite Loki's concerns about how he will be received there.

=== Death ===
{{see|Avengers: Infinity War}}
While en-route to Earth, in 2018, Loki and Thor are intercepted by a large spacecraft carrying [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] and his [[Children of Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|children]], alerted to their location by the presence of the Tesseract secretly being held by Loki. After wiping out half of the Asgardians onboard while the rest flee via escape pods, Thanos, wielding the Power Stone, overpowers Thor and Hulk, kills Heimdall, and claims the Space Stone from the Tesseract that Loki hands over to him in order to spare Thor's life. In a last act of self-sacrifice, Loki pretends to swear allegiance to Thanos, only to attempt to stab his throat. Thanos intercepts the attack with one of his infinity stones, and kills Loki by snapping his neck, leaving his body to be cradled in his brother's arms.

A variant of Loki, dubbed '''Variant L1130''', retrieves the Tesseract in an alternate 2012 during the Avengers' "Time Heist" and escapes following the [[Battle of New York (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Battle of New York]], forming a new timeline. Loki escapes into Mongolia and is taken into custody by the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), while the new timeline is reset and destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/loki-disney-plus-villains-time-variance-authority-explained-marvel-mcu|title=Marvel's Time Variance Authority Explained: Why Is Loki Imprisoned in the Disney Plus Series? |last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 3, 2020|access-date=February 3, 2020}}</ref>

TVA judge [[Ravonna Renslayer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravonna Renslayer]] labels him a rogue variant to be "reset". However, TVA agent [[Mobius M. Mobius (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mobius M. Mobius]] intervenes and takes Loki to a Time Theatre where he reviews Loki's past misdeeds and questions his real motive for hurting people. After realizing that the [[Infinity Stones]] cannot help him, as well as viewing his would-be future on the "Sacred Timeline", including his own death at the hand of Thanos, he agrees to help Mobius stop a rogue variant of himself.

==== Working with the Time Variance Authority ====
{{Further|The Variant}}
Loki joins a TVA mission following an ambush by the fugitive Loki Variant in 1985 [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]. Loki stalls for time, but Mobius understands his plan. After some research, Loki proposes that the Variant is hiding near apocalyptic events like [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]]'s [[Ragnarok (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|RagnarÃ¶k]], where the impending destruction means their actions cannot change the timeline, thus concealing them from the TVA. Loki and Mobius confirm this possibility by visiting [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD|Pompeii in 79 AD]]. Travelling to 2050 [[Alabama]], they encounter The Variant, who rejects Loki's offer to work together to overthrow the Time-Keepers, before revealing herself as a female variant of Loki. The Variant then uses TVA Reset Charges to "bomb" the timeline, creating new timeline branches to keep the organization's minutemen busy, before escaping through a portal to the TVA to assassinate the Time-Keepers, with Loki in pursuit.

==== Allying with Sylvie ====
{{Further|Lamentis|The Nexus Event}}
After a confrontation at the TVA, Loki teleports the Variant to Lamentis-1, a planet set to be destroyed by a meteor shower, using their TemPad. Both are unable to escape due to the TemPad having run out of power. Agreeing to ally with one another, the Variant introduces herself to Loki by the [[pseudonym|alias]] "[[Sylvie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sylvie]]" and proposes a truce in order to escape the planet. The pair sneak aboard a train bound for the Ark, a spaceship intended to evacuate Lamentis-1, in order to siphon its power and recharge the TemPad. On the train, Loki gets drunk and starts a ruckus, causing him and Sylvie to be discovered and forced out by the guards. While walking to the Ark in order to instead hijack it and leave the planet, to prevent it from being destroyed as according to the Sacred Timeline, Loki enquires about Sylvie's enchantment ability, learning that the agents of the TVA are variants themselves; Loki reveals to Sylvie that the TVA agents, including Mobius, are not aware that they are variants. With the TemPad broken, the pair fight their way through the guards and through a meteor shower to the Ark, only to witness it being destroyed by a meteor just as they get to it, leaving them stranded.

On Lamentis-1, Sylvie tells Loki she escaped the TVA when she was about to be arrested as a child. Loki and Sylvie form a romantic bond, creating a branched timeline never seen by the TVA. Mobius rescues the two from Lamentis and has them both arrested, punishing Loki by leaving him in a time loop from his past. After Mobius derides Loki for having fallen in love with Sylvie, Loki tells him that everyone working for the TVA are variants, which Mobius investigates. Now aware of his background upon finding proof, Mobius frees Loki from the loop, but is soon confronted by Renslayer and pruned. Loki and Sylvie are taken to the Time-Keepers, accompanied by Renslayer and her minutemen. Hunter B-15 intervenes, freeing Loki and Sylvie of their time twisting collars, and in the ensuing fight, the minutemen are killed whilst Renslayer is knocked unconscious by Sylvie. Sylvie then beheads one of the Time-Keepers, who turn out to all be androids. Loki prepares to tell Sylvie about his feelings, but Renslayer regains consciousness and prunes him. He awakens in a post-apocalyptic world, dubbed "the Void", with multiple other Loki variants, who invite him to join them.

==== Surviving in the Void ====
{{Further|Journey into Mystery (Loki)|l1=Journey into Mystery}}
Loki learns from his other variants that a cloud-like creature named Alioth guards the Void and prevents anyone from escaping. Boastful Loki attempts to betray the other Lokis for another Loki variant (who was elected president in his timeline), causing a fight to ensue, forcing Loki and his variant allies to escape. After reuniting with Loki, Sylvie proposes a plan to approach Alioth and enchant it, in hopes that it will lead them to the real mastermind behind the TVA's creation, whilst Mobius teleports back to the TVA. Kid Loki and Reptile Loki escape while Classic Loki creates a large illusion of Asgard to distract Alioth and sacrifices himself in the process. This allows Loki and Sylvie to successfully enchant the creature and move past the Void. Noticing a citadel in the foreground, the pair walk towards it.

==== Meeting He Who Remains ====
{{Further|For All Time. Always.}}
In the Citadel at the End of Time, Loki and Sylvie meet Miss Minutes and reject an offer from her creator, "[[He Who Remains (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|He Who Remains]]", to return them to the timeline with everything they desire. He Who Remains reveals to Loki and Sylvie that he created the TVA after ending a multiversal war caused by his variants. As the timeline begins to branch, he offers them a choice: kill him and end the singular timeline, causing another multiversal war, or become his successors in overseeing the TVA. Sylvie decides to kill him, while Loki pleads with her to stop. They kiss, but Sylvie sends Loki back to TVA headquarters. At TVA headquarters, Loki warns B-15 and Mobius about variants of He Who Remains, but they do not recognize him. Loki sees that a statue in the likeness of He Who Remains has replaced those of the Time-Keepers.

=== 2013 Time Heist ===
{{further|Avengers: Endgame}}
An alternate version of Loki from the events of ''Thor: The Dark World'' briefly appears in ''Avengers: Endgame''. In an alternate 2013, Thor and Rocket travel to Asgard to take the Reality Stone, passing unnoticed by a bored Loki in his holding cell at the dungeons.

* A variant of Loki dubbed "'''{{visible anchor|Boastful Loki}}'''" (portrayed by [[DeObia Oparei]]) wields a hammer and makes wild exaggerations about his accomplishments (including claiming to have defeated Captain America and Iron Man, and obtained the Infinity Stones). Boastful Loki attempts to betray the Classic, Kid, and Alligator variants by allying with President Loki to rule the Void, but fails.
* A reptilian variant of Loki dubbed "'''{{visible anchor|Alligator Loki}}'''" lives in the Void with fellow Loki variants. ''Loki'' head writer [[Michael Waldron]] included him "because he's green", describing it as an "irreverent" addition. Director [[Kate Herron]] used a "cartoony" stuffed alligator during filming, allowing actors to interact with it, with the onscreen version rendered using CGI.<ref name="AlligatorLoki">{{Cite web|title='Loki': The Glorious Debut of Alligator Loki |date=July 7, 2021 |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/glorious-alligator-loki |url-status=live |access-date=July 7, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210707084520/https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/glorious-alligator-loki |archive-date=July 7, 2021 |first=Rachel |last=Paige |website=[[Marvel.com]]}}</ref>

He attempts to rule the Void with an army of other variants, and is at odds with Kid Loki.<ref name="EWEp5Recap" /> Hiddleston called President Loki "the worst of the bad bunch", describing him as "the least vulnerable, the most autocratic and terrifyingly ambitious character who seems to have no empathy or care for anyone else".<ref name="MarvelLokiVariants">{{Cite web |last=Paige |first=Rachel |date=July 7, 2021 |title=Meet the Other Lokis in Marvel Studios' 'Loki' |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/meet-the-other-lokis-classic-kid-boastful-alligator |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210707174912/https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/meet-the-other-lokis-classic-kid-boastful-alligator |archive-date=July 7, 2021 |access-date=July 7, 2021 |website=[[Marvel.com]]}}</ref> His costume was inspired by the comic miniseries ''[[Vote Loki]]''.<ref name="LokiTrailerEEsPolygon">{{Cite web |last1=Polo |first1=Susana |last2=Patches |first2=Matt |last3=McWhertor |first3=Michael |date=December 11, 2020 |title=All the Easter eggs in Marvel's Loki and Falcon and the Winter Soldier trailers |url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/11/22169507/loki-trailer-falcon-and-the-winter-easter-eggs-marvel-comics |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201211181415/https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/11/22169507/loki-trailer-falcon-and-the-winter-easter-eggs-marvel-comics |archive-date=December 11, 2020 |access-date=December 11, 2020 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref><ref name="NewsweekVariants">{{Cite web |last=Burton |first=Jamie |date=July 7, 2021 |title=Every Version of Loki Seen in Episode 5 of 'Loki' Explained |url=https://www.newsweek.com/every-version-loki-seen-episode-5-explained-1607434 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210707115853/https://www.newsweek.com/every-version-loki-seen-episode-5-explained-1607434 |archive-date=July 7, 2021 |access-date=July 7, 2021 |website=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref>

{{See also|What If...? (TV series)}}
Several [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate versions]] of Loki appear in the animated series ''What If...?'', with Hiddleston reprising his role.

==== Conquering the Earth ====
{{Further|What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?|What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?}}
In an alternate 2011, following the death of Thor during his exile to Earth, Loki arrives with the Asgardian army to avenge him. Confronted by [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], he defeats them using the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Casket of Ancient Winters|Casket of Ancient Winters]] before threatening to turn the entire world into ice. After negotiating with Fury, he agrees to give him until the next sunrise to find his brother's killer, whom Fury deduces to be [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]]. The two confront him in [[San Francisco]] and defeat him, but Loki decides to remain on Earth and quickly becomes its ruler while ending all conflict on Earth.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kean |first=Sean |date=August 25, 2021 |title=What Ifâ€¦? episode 3 recap: Marvel heroes' careers are cut short by a mystery villain |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/what-if-episode-3-recap-marvel-heroes-careers-are-cut-short-by-a-mystery-villain/ |access-date=August 25, 2021 |website=[[CNET]]}}</ref>

Sometime later, Fury assembles a resistance movement to overthrow Loki and a battle ensues between S.H.I.E.L.D. and Loki's Asgardian forces. Just as Loki is about to claim victory, the [[Watcher (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Watcher]] brings in a [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] from another reality where [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] possessed [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]'s body and killed the Avengers. She proceeds to subdue Loki with his Scepter.

==== Frost Giant prince ====
{{Further|What If... Thor Were an Only Child?}}
In an alternate 965 A.D., Odin returns an infant Loki to Laufey rather than adopting him, resulting in Loki growing up to be the Frost Giant prince of [[Jotunheim (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jotunheim]]. Loki and Thor later meet under unknown circumstances and become best friends. In 2011, Loki attends Thor's intergalactic party on Earth alongside his fellow Frost Giants, who vandalize [[Mount Rushmore]]. Loki accidentally prevents Jane Foster from contacting Thor when, due to his large Frost Giant fingers, he drops and breaks Thor's cell phone. He and his Frost Giants later send the [[London Eye]] spinning off into one direction. When Thor intimidates the party guests into cleaning up while also mentioning that Frigga is coming, Loki's fellow Frost Giants put the London Eye back on its stand.

==Reception==
The character of Loki "has been a fan favorite ever since his central role in 2012's ''The Avengers''",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/loki-tv-show-questions-answers-death-tesseract/|title=Loki TV Show Answers Tom Hiddleston's Death & Tesseract Questions|first=Kyle|last=Morris|publisher=[[ScreenRant]]|date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> becoming "one of the MCU's most beloved characters".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/586595/tom-hiddleston-loki-series-departure-from-mcu-films|title=Tom Hiddleston Says Disney+ Loki Series Is a 'New Departure' From the MCU Films|first=Jessica|last=Bowman|website=mentalfloss.com|date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Hiddleston has received a number of nominations and awards for his performance of the character.
