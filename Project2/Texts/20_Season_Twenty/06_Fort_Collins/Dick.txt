We came to celebrate! I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world. And I think on the next one,  we're only gonna get better. Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world? What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt. But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election. Of course it's political! I remember being called a fag for no reason. Okay.  Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins. Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy.  I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?  Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie  flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the-- I miss my friend. I don't know how things got derailed but, I-I'm sorry if I made you upset. I want to be buddies again. Come on, let's just have a couple of beers and do some trolling. Why are you mad at ''me'''? I refuse to believe that Skankhunt is that shallow. When you Photoshopped penises in Kesha survivors' mouths, it's not just to make people laugh. If someone Photoshopped a dick in your wife's mouth, would you just think it was funny? It's true. You're just an asshole. I thought you were the ultimate rebel. I actually looked up to you and you're nothing but a super... dick. At least I have a reason to be angry. What do you have, that it's funny? Hurting people is just worth the laughs? One day you're gonna wake up and realize that you don't have anyone either.
