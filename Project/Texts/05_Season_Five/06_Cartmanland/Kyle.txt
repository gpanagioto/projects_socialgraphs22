"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!" "Have mercy!"  Yeah ha ha! Nuh uh. What the hell are you doing, fatass?! Kenny ''wasn't'' lying. Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it! No... No, this isn't possible. No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars? Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?  Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.  Great.  It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow. So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?! Hunh, I guess you're right. Where are we going?  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts! Hohohooho! Oowwww!  Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!! Oh God, get me off of here!!   Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!! My life can't get any worse! Lucky.  Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you? But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude. Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids? No! I finally do understand! There ''is'' no justice! There ''is'' no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!! Agh!   I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?  Satan talked to God?  And that's it? That's the end? That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan? Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God. Oh... Oohhâ€”Ohuhughughhh...   Huh?  Huh? You ''are'' up there!
