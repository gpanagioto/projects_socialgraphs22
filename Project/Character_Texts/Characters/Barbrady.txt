That's not how ''I'' played it! It's almost midnight. 
Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this:  You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker. Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job! Now?  Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book. 
Oh, that was so touching. 
I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake. 
 Hello, Mr. Tweek. Who was that? 
Right. Ready. Damn, he's quick! No, I'm sorry.   No, it's all me. Uh, my bad. Sorry.  Blue?  Uh. Blue is blue? Where am I? Okie-dokie. Four?  Jakov  
 Okay, so just what is going on here, people? What? Are you sure? So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide? What's the Ganz technique? 
Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen?  That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.  What the hell is ''that'' thing??  Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me! Oh? Okay buddy, you can explain downtown!  
 The South win? 
Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder. Hey!  Bill Cosby? Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby! Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. 
What kind of shit is this? 
 Hello? Who is this? Yes. Are you calling about the abduction? Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican? We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry. 
Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over! Could I see your license, please? Well then, I have to take you to jail. I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh. 
Hello? From what? Who is this? Are you serious? Like what? Oh jeez. 
Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over! Come on, time to go home. Ey, put down my car!  No! No! Hey, stop it! 
What's going on back there? Freeze! Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal.  
Okay, people, try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez. 
Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself.  
And that's when I masturbated to ''Game of Thrones''. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty. But I am done forever with ''Game of Thrones''. Forever Thank you.  I, I feel really good. 
 Whoa! Nobody move! What's happening? Oh, they've got me!  Mayor, I didn't know if there was a gunman, or a bomb- I'm sorry. No, Mayor, please. This is all I know. I used to be the only policeman in this town, remember? Bob, ah I used to chase away the sixth graders for you.  No, please, not my sunglasses. Where should I go? Hi, sweetheart. I've uh... I've been let go from the force. I'm so sorry. It might be a little tough to afford your medication, but I'll find a way. You know me. I like to help. I like to be needed.  Uh, who? What do you want? I'm no good as a policeman. I'm a bumbling old fool. They need me? To do what? No! Shoot kids? I don't wanna shoot kids! No. No. Are any of them minorities? Noo no no no no no no no no! Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh God.   Oh ho ho.  I understand you feeling angry at this town. I'm getting pretty angry too. But we can't give up on it. Please boys, don't make it end violently. Aaahaahaaawe! Everybody told me they were terrorists. But, you said you needed me to kill some kids. Yes? You do? Yeah, a lot of changes. What? 
Come with me if you want to live!  
What? I'm not shooting any more kids. No! I'm not shooting any more people! Not for you, not for nobody! Maybe so. All I know is I'm done shooting people!  Oh sorry. Jeez.
