Cat pee?  All right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine.  Okay, ready Kenny? All right, bring out...! The other male cat.  Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed?   Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny! Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls. Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you? Ah, Kenny!  Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Here. Write a diary. Yeah, who has cats these days?    Who is it?!  Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another. I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more... What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here! Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties. He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude. They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand!  But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong.   Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle. Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
