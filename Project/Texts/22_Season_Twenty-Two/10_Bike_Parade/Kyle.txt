Yehehes! Yeessss! I got fulfilled! It's all the stuff I ordered for the bike parade.  Yeah? No, Dad. These were special deliveries from Jeff Bezos. We helped Amazon with their strike, and he had our orders shipped.  Yeah. We helped him find workers to work during the strike. So he found our orders and had them sent to us. They look amazing.  Come on, dude. We're gonna take 'em for a test spin. Well why not? Kenny, you can't quit now! We have a four-bike theme! How's it look like it's going? There's no way we're going to win this stupid bike parade!  Face it Stan! Our bikes suck! We're gonna lose! We're gonna be the laughingstock of the whole thing! I wish there never was a bike parade. What's offensive about a bike parade? Oh, I get it. I can't believe Kenny bailed on us just because he thinks Jeff Bezos is a bad guy. Such bullcrap.  No. No! The problem is that when it comes to outrage, your average person actually doesn't give a shit, unless it has something to do with them. Kenny was right about you. You're a bad guy! Why are you doing this?!
