All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round! You've got some family here watching tonight.  And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home? Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is  People Who Annoy You. As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E.  We just need three more consonants, and a vowel. And a vowel? Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here.  Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh. Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.
