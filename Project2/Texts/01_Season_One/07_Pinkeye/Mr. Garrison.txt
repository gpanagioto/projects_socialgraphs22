It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle. Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel- Is there a problem Kenny? Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay? Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes. Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers. Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume. ...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children.  Yeah. Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe. That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing. Wait your turn Clyde.
