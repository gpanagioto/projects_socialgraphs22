'''Mariko Yashida'''<!-- Can "矢志田 真理子" be sourced? A discussion on WT:JAPAN in December 2017 indicated that the name had historically been written 吉田, which would make sense. Either way, it's not "key" information required for the first sentence as it would be for a character originating in Japanese media. --> is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been depicted as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s romantic interest.

She was portrayed by [[Tao Okamoto]] in the 2013 film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #118 (Feb 1979).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=432}}</ref> In an interview published in ''[[Back Issue!]]'' magazine #4, Byrne claims Mariko was based on Lady Toda Mariko, a character in the 1975 novel ''[[Shōgun (novel)|Shōgun]]'': "I had just read ''Shogun'', which Chris had not read at that point. I just absolutely wanted to steal that character, just shamelessly steal the character. And as you probably know, she was created to die.”

==Fictional character biography==
Mariko was the daughter of [[Shingen Yashida]], the half-sister of [[Kenuichio Harada]], and cousin of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Sunpyre]] and the aunt of [[Shingen Yashida|Shingen "Shin" Harada]].

She first met the [[X-Men]] when they returned from a sojourn in the [[Savage Land]] and were asked to help Japan, which was being blackmailed by the terrorist [[Moses Magnum]]. At that time, she encountered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a private moment, which developed into a mutual attraction.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #118</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=188}}</ref> Afterward, Mariko would frequently visit the United States to see Wolverine.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #143</ref>

Some time later, however, Mariko was married by Shingen to Yakuza gang leader Noburu-Hideki to solidify her father's connections to the Japanese underworld, and was subjected to brutal domestic abuse by her husband. She was later used by him to maneuver Wolverine into participating in an assassination of a rival by having the superhero inadvertently provide a distraction while protecting his true love/girlfriend from the rival's own assassins. This also had the intended effect of deepening Mariko's disgust for Logan upon witnessing Logan going berserk in battle. However, Mariko soon realized that her father was evil and was shaming her family with sinister schemes. To stop Shingen, Mariko planned to kill her father and then commit [[seppuku]] in recompense, but Logan, learning the truth about this manipulation and inspired by a personal epiphany about humanity, attacked and slew her father in a fair battle of honor before she could act. In doing so, Logan was convinced that Mariko would be honorbound to kill him for that and was prepared to die at her hands rather than harm her in self-defense. However, Mariko explained her opinion of her father and presented the family [[katana]] to Logan as a token of her approval as an honorable warrior who is properly entitled to it.<ref>''Wolverine'' (1982 miniseries) #1-4</ref>

Upon her father's death, she became head (Oyabun) of the [[Yakuza]] crime family Clan Yashida.

Mariko happily became Logan's fiancée, but their wedding was halted by the supervillain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] who used a mind control device to change Mariko's mind.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #173</ref> When the control was lifted, Wolverine and Mariko resumed their romantic relationship after a period of separation, but have not reconsidered marriage. Mariko also refused any closer engagement with Logan until she had dealt with her father's criminal legacy, which she felt honor-bound to rectify.

The X-Men returned from the first [[Secret Wars]] and, accidentally ending up in Japan, fighting a dragon their companion [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]] had brought along. During the chaos, the young girl [[Amiko Kobayashi]] loses her mother when a collapsing building crushes her. Dying, the woman begs Wolverine to take care of her daughter.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #181 (May 1984)</ref> Since Wolverine could not take care of the girl himself, Wolverine chose to place Amiko in Mariko's care, whom the girl soon adopted as a surrogate mother. Amiko and Mariko were at one point targeted by [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]] (one of Wolverine's old enemies) but the attack was averted by Wolverine and [[Kitty Pryde]].

Mariko was poisoned with [[tetrodotoxin]] from a [[blowfish]] by the assassin Reiko in the employ of her rival [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #57 (July 1992)</ref> She asked Wolverine to [[Euthanasia|kill her]] to avoid a painful death and preserve her honor. Wolverine killed her and vowed to [[revenge|avenge]] Mariko by yearly severing parts of Matsu'o's body on the anniversary of her death.

Phaedra, an agent of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], resurrected Shingen and stole a piece of Wolverine's soul to torture. Wolverine made a deal with Azrael (the Angel of Death) to kill Phaedra to stop resurrecting the dead if Azrael would heal Wolverine's soul. Phaedra attempted to convince Wolverine to spare her by offering to resurrect Mariko, but Wolverine refused. Wolverine stated that he would pay any price to bring Mariko back, but Logan deeply loved Mariko because she was a better person than himself in every way, and he knew that Mariko would never accept life if it meant that someone as evil as Phaedra was allowed to live as well.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #61</ref>

Many years later, Wolverine was captured by the Devil and taken to Hell. In order to have Wolverine comply with his demands, the lord of Hell had Mariko's soul (who had been condemned to Hell for her leadership of the Yashida clan's criminal activities) brought to torture Wolverine into submission; Wolverine, however, was eventually rescued by [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] and [[Thomas Logan]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #2</ref> When Logan finally prepared to flee Hell, Logan intended to take Mariko alongside but (feeling remorse) she asked to be left behind and return to Earth and reclaim his own life, a request Logan reluctantly acquiesced to.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #4</ref>

[[Old Man Logan]] faced off against the Hand during their Regenix operation, facing their latest member called the '''Scarlet Samurai'''. Logan later discovered that Scarlet Samurai is Mariko resurrected by the Hand to serve as their weapon. With help from Logan, nanites were used to free Mariko from the Hand's control while Gorgon got away.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #31-33. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Logan prepared to return to his own time, he asked Mariko to keep an eye on the young girl would have been in his wife in his own timeline, feeling that asking the other X-Men to keep an eye on her would have risked bringing her too close to his own life whereas Mariko understood the consequences of loving Logan and would be able to keep the girl safe while keeping her distant.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #6</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" timeline, Mariko Yashida was a member of the Human High Council, a group of humans that opposed [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] tyrannical rule. While not engaged to Logan, Mariko was his former lover and she birthed a daughter, Kirika, an amalgam of [[X-23]] and [[Amiko Kobayashi]]. Mariko participates in an attempt to bomb forces of Apocalypse based in North America, though she knows this would mean extensive civilian deaths.

===Exiles===
[[File:Sunfiredeath.PNG|right|250px|The death of Sunfire. Art by Clayton Henry.|thumb]]

In an alternate universe (Earth-2109), Mariko Yashida was '''[[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]''' and a member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] from ''Exiles'' #2 (September, 2001) until her death in ''Exiles'' #37 (January, 2004) of their ongoing series. In the 2109 alternate universe, she had the same powers as her 616 [[Marvel Universe]] counterpart [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Sunpyre]]. This version was created by [[Judd Winick]] and [[Mike McKone]]. A [[Japan]]ese citizen and a member of the [[X-Men]] in her reality, she was one of Marvel's few openly [[homosexual]] characters. She has a relationship with one reality's version of Spider-Woman ([[Mary Jane Watson]]).

====Reception====
Sunfire's open homosexuality has attracted some interest after [[coming out]] in ''Exiles'' #11.<ref>[http://www.gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=58 Gay League profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012222324/http://gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=58 |date=2007-10-12 }}</ref> Her death has also garnered some attention. Perry Moore includes her as an example of the poor treatment of gay superheroes, paralleling the earlier [[Women in Refrigerators]].<ref>Perry Moore (2007) ''Hero'' (432 pages, [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]], {{ISBN|1-4231-0195-2}}) [http://perrymoorestories.com/content/hero.asp?id=superheroes extract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012225358/http://perrymoorestories.com/content/hero.asp?id=superheroes |date=2007-10-12 }}: "Who Cares About the Death of a Gay Superhero Anyway?"</ref>

[[Judd Winick]] has been accused{{by whom|date=November 2014}} of pursuing some broader social agenda, making Sunfire gay being one of his ideas used to support this notion, as he explains in an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]]:<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=4298 Winick on "Green Arrow",  Mia's HIV Status and More], [[Comic Book Resources]], October 14, 2004</ref>

{{quote|I've done a smattering of stories that are socially relevant and I'm considered the soap-box guy. I've done one story arc in ''Green Lantern'' featuring a gay character who was a survivor of a hate crime. Sunfire was gay in ''Exiles''.  And there's other stuff sort of there that people like to hang their hat on, saying I'm just this big commie out there pushing an agenda. It's only a handful of stories.}}

===What If?===
In the ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' story "If Wolverine Had Married Mariko", their marriage is not hindered by [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], and Wolverine becomes head of the Shingen clan. However, they soon have to contend with the Yakuza, all united by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].

In the episode "Code of Conduct", Mariko is at the Japanese Embassy looking for her power-hungry husband when Silver Samurai had abducted the [[X-Men]]. She's present at the recent duel between Logan and Silver Samurai. After Harada acted dishonorably (using mutant abilities when not allowed) which annulled the duel and was taken away for dishonoring the Yakuza clan who agreed to release the X-Men, Mariko told Logan that her husband will be driven from the Yakuza in shame and will not be admitted again. When she's asked why she had chosen Harada over Logan, she said that her father and the Yakuza would have killed them both had she not chosen Harada, awaiting her decision with drawn swords. She said that marrying Harada was the only honorable thing she could do, even if it meant keeping her and Logan forever apart from one another. Mariko and Logan then went their separate ways.

When it's revealed that Ichirō's alive and used Mariko as bait to capture and extract Wolverine's immortality using a robotic [[adamantium]] armor, she manages to free Wolverine by directing the machine Wolverine is in into the sword strike, breaking her grandfather's focus and freeing Wolverine.
