Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?! How ''dare'' you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?! So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea? Our family doesn't ''celebrate'' Christmas. Whatwhatwhaaat?!? ''You're'' not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!! How about the dreidel song, bubbe? Kyle, that is enough! Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison. That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community! Kyle! Sshhh! Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww. Your father's right, Kyle. Listen to your father, Kyle. This is for your own good, bubbe. OH MY GOD! Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?! Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it. What the hell is this??? This is horrible!!!
