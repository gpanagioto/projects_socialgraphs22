What?! No way, Wendy, today's the day! Oh boy! We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV! You tell 'em, Cartman! What?  Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming. It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-? Mom, gross!  Stop it, Mom! I'm going too.  Yeah it's different, Mom! Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny. On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.  Yeah!! Mom, we didn't mean...  Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
