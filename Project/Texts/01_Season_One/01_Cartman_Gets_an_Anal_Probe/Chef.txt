Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley. Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night? Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes? Oh!  Did they give you an anal probe? That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt. Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. Hello there, children. How are you doing? Why bad? <poem>--get those juices flowin'--</poem> <poem>--we're makin' love gravy--</poem> <poem>--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!</poem> <poem>Love luh--</poem> Huh? Do you feel better? Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day. What?! What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it! It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device. This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us. It's no joke, children, this is big! Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children.  Okay children, this is your chance! Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready. Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before ''Sanford and Son'' is on. Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back! Well, i- it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
