Well that burned a long time.  Oh dude, there goes one. What, Butters? Tell him we're busy. Alright, let's go see what he wants.  What? A boat? Well WHAT, Cartman? Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?! Stem cells? Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again. The principal? Aw, come on! Wait. What's going on here?  Well how sick?  ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right? Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.  ...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend. No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!!   Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!  I can't, I just can't.  I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing. And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!  Just leave me alone!  Hey Chef. Bad. Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend? But then, why does God give us anything to start with? I think I understand. Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now. Hey, Kenny!  No. But...  Did he say anything before he went? I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend.  What, Cartman? What's happened? This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses? Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!
