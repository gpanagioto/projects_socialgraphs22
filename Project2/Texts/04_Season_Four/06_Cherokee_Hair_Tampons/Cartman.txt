 Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.  Oh, hoho. Ow. Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man! Huh? Not with me, man.  But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle. "Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny. Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5. No, mine. M'yah!  Yeah. Okay, mom. What's goin' on, guys? Oh-kay. Uh huh. Oh, I think I see where this is going.  Stan, why don't you just ask the question? <poem><i>'No no, no no, nono no!<br />Nonono, no no!</i></poem> Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price. I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle? Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars. What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah! No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!  Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp!   Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!  Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000! I do! I do care! Look how much.  Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!  Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney! It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay! Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before. You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please. No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE! Thank you.   Heh. Hey, what what's going on? Huh? Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!  I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!! Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
