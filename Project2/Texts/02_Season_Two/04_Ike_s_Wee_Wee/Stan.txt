 Booooo!  I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? Why do dogs have cold noses? Oh. Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday? Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother ''presents'' for a bris? Well, dude, you better find out! Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? Man! That sucked, getting searched. No, dude, we never even saw it! We know, we know, that's what ''everybody'' says. What do ya mean? Ahhh, bicycles? Your eyes? Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.  Kyle! You have to stop them! Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike! They're gonna chop off his wee wee! Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision! Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris. What are you goin' to do, dude? Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike. Dude, what did you make that doll out of? Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis! Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude. Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea! Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad. Yeah.  Naturally. You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.  Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?
