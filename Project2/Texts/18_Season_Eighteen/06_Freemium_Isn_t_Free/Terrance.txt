 What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?! What's this? So this is- Everyone is doing this? Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.  Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing. We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford. You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?! You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine! But then all our profits come from people with problems. Who IS this guy?! Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil! Oh no!
