M ma um m-me too. Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox. Yeah! You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on. Ya yo you can't, you can't do that. Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us.  C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club. Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton. Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.
