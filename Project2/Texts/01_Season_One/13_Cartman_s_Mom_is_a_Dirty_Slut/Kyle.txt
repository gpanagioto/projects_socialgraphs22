Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong Yeah. Whoa, dude. Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school. Come on! Let's go make fun of him! Really? Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman. Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them. Woo-whataya mean? How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs? Yeah, dude. It looks ''riveting''.  Hunh? Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on '''Full House'''. Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought. Wow, I wish ''we'' had a stupidest home video. Did you send the videotape to ''America's Stupidest Home Videos''? If we win, we can buy a ''new'' go-cart that ''actually runs''. You live on the Eastside, Cartman! You bastards! Yeah, with butterscotch. Woohoo! We're gonna win $10,000!  I'm gonna buy a ''Walkman'' with ''my'' half. Dude. What the hell is wrong with you? Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.  They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win! We're gonna win!. You bastards! Dammit! Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.  Dad, how ''could'' you?!
