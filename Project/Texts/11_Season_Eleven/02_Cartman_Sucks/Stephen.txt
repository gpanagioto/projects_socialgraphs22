Butters! Butters! What are you doing?! Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this!   Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this? Don't ''lie to me, Butters!'' I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious. You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters.  Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious. You see? What can I do, Father? A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.  Thank you so much for taking him in. There you are, Butters! What's he done now?! Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change. Well you know somethin'? So do I.
