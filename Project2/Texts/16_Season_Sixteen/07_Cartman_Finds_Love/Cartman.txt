What?  Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most. Oh my God. Tolkien, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Tolkien. I'm happy for you. Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?  What the? ...Oh, Tolkien's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Tolkien! Yeah, get in there. ...Tolkien. You want me to pass her a jelly bean? Huh? Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.   Dude, dude. Dude.  Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Tolkien? Well, Tolkien's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know. Yeah, of course.  Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move? Thanks, you guys. WHAT?! KYLE?!  Motherfucker!  Hey, ah, Nichole, right? Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle? Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together? Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had. Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out. Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch.  Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.  Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Tolkien and Nichole are gonna be practically married. No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push. Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys!   Oh my God, sooo cute.  Ohhhhh my God. You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me.  Did you see that? Tolkien was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead.  I don't know, it's just so... perfect.  Kyle, Jesus Christ! Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you? Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Tolkien and Nichole! They belong together! Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence they ended up together?! Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that. Shh, quiet, Cupid Me. Nothing. Nobody. Why, Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Tolkien and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?! Come on!  Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?! That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?! Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts. You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you!  I'm gonna get you!  I almost got you! Almost!  Everything's great, Mom.   It's not fair! They were so... happy! It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other! No, they won't! No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole! And you! I should have never believed in you!  That's right... That's right!  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you. Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything. Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars.  Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do. Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important. Denver Nuggets game?  Nooooooo!  No time! NOOOOOOO! Attention! Attention please!  I swear, Kyle.  Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously you guys, you gotta see it. It's the Bat-Mobile! It's outside. Oh my gohhhd, so cute!  That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together. Really?! What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me! Hey, stop it! Nooo!
