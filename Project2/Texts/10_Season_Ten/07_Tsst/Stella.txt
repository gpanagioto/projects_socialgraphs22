It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are ''not'' going to be tolerated anymore!   Hello. I'm Nanny Stella. And you must be Eric. Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done. I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen. Right. Then I'm going to have to take it.  Come on.  All right, that's it!   Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes. It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up. Eric, you have to stay in time-out!  Come on, you don't have a choice.  Eric, you need to understand ''why'' you are being punished. All right? Well then, I'll just have to stand ''right here''!  He spit in my mouth! All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!  Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry? Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life? And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell ''you'' how to live.  See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric? Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you. Oh, I just never had kids. It... just... didn't happen. Why you, you...  you little bastard! How dare you?! What kind of  monster would- That's it!  I'm not doing this! Find yourself another nanny... television show!
