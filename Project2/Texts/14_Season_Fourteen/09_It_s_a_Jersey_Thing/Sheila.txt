 Where did you hear that? A new family moved in? Where are they from?  New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?  Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know? Never invite a New Jersey housewife into your home.   All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!  That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool. That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or or, somehow, you know, hold it against me. You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing.   Kyle? You in there? Kyle, open the door. Kyle, this instant! One, two.  I guess we need to talk. I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle. When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus. I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey. It isn't so bad, Kyle, a lot of people think the Jersey look is nice!
