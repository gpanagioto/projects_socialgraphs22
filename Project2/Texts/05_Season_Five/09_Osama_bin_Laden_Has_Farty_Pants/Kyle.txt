...Remember when life used to be simple and cool? These are ''gas'' masks, Butters! Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.  Dude, what's going on? Well what are we supposed to do with it? Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster. Uh oh, they're closing! Yeah.  Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.  Hey, wait! There are children in here!  Oh God, it was horrible! Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for ''20 hours!'' You sonofabitch, Cartman!  Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too! Is this the right house? Hey! What the hell are you doing?! Then why did you send us the goat? Jawas? Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane! Um...  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it? Good job, fatass! Oh crap, it's him! But I thought you hate us. Cartman, where are you going?? Cartman, he's crazy! Where do we go?  All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan ''like'' America. Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women! Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them. Yeah. I'm confused.  Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America. Yeah.
