 Are you guys still playing that video game? Eric, put that down! Just go put it back in the trashcan! No that... that came from me; just put it away. Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting. Sure. Here you go, boys.  Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late. Nothing. Come on, Randy.  Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now. No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school. No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you. Go!
