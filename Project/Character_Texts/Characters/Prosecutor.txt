I am, Your Honor. 
Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of "Tolkien?" Who is Tolkien?  Black?! Did you say black?! You called him black?! O!  He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out! The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!! What? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This "monster" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!  The prosecution rests.
