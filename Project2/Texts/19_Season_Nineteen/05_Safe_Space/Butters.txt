Do I gotta? Well, if I get detention, uh, I'll get grounded.  Eric, hold up. Yeah. Yeah, right here.  I just finished this morning. Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here.  It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness. But, PC Principal, I really don't have time. Yes sir... Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Jesus. Whoa my God. Wugh.  Yeah! Well, I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people. Well, I've got Demi Lovato  to take care of now, and Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments. Okay, Eric.   Do I have to, sir? PC Principal, ah, I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through. Vin Diesel too??  Uh, delete! "You aren't fat, but my dick is-" Whoa, God. GAAAHHH! What?  I don't know you, sir!  The man! The man the man the man the man!  Do you see the man?! Well, he's gonna get me!  The world is darkness! The man is coming! Aaaaa! Aaaaa!  The man is gonna get me if I don't stop!  Are you sure this is a good idea?
