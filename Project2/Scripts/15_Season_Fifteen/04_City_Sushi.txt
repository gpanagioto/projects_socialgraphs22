+++++Downtown South Park. There's traffic and people on the sidewalk. Among all that is a small postman who looks pretty familiar. The postman stops at a kitchenware place and knocks on the door. A cashier comes to the door and opens it+++++
Butters : Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. ''[hands him a flyer]''
Cashier : What's this?
Butters : An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
Cashier : Thanks.
Butters : You can count on Postman Butters! ''[salutes and leaves. As he does so, the cashier makes a ball out of the flyer and tosses it away. Butters doesn't notice, but instead sees a woman coming up and hands her a flyer]'' Special delivery, ma'am. ''[sees a man coming up and hands him a flyer. The woman crumples up her flyer and tosses it away]'' Here you are, sir. ''[the man balls up and tosses his flyer away]'' Brand new sushi restaurant in town.

Butters : It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
Tuong Lu Kim : A what? Ret me see that! ''[grabs the flyer]'' Oh no, a sushi prace? How come every time a hard-working Chinese man open a business, some shmelly Japanese dog has to come and try invade him?!
Butters : Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
Tuong Lu Kim : Where is this Japanese-uh toiret bowl?! How far from my Shitty Wok?!
Butters : Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.

+++++Inside City Sushi. Butters follows Mr. Kim in+++++
Mr. Takiyama : Welcome to City Sushi. Can I take er order prease?
Tuong Lu Kim : What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!
Mr. Takiyama : I'm sorry I do not understand your accent. You want a Shitty tuna roll?
Tuong Lu Kim : No I don't want Shitty tuna roll! I want you to go find another shitty town to open your Shitty Sushi prace!
Mr. Takiyama : Why don't you please ujust speak Engrish? Maybe I can understand you!
Tuong Lu Kim : I ''am'' speaking Engrish! Why don't ''you'' speak a fucking Engrish, you soba eating fuck!
Mr. Takiyama : Get out or I call porice!
Tuong Lu Kim : Come on, kid, you don't wanna eat this-a Shitty Sushi! It give you worms.
Mr. Takiyama : Better than Shitty Kung Pao Chicken made from cat! ''[Mr. Kim turns and runs to the counter, jumps over it and lands a blow in Mr. Takiyama's face. They trade blows. Mr. Kim ends with an uppercut]''
+++++Butters' house, day. Sgt. Yates and another office bring Butters home. Sgt. Yates knocks, Mr. Stotch answers+++++
Steven : Hello?
Sgt. Yates : Sir, does this mailman belong to you?
Stephen : That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?
Sgt. Yates : There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.
Stephen : What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
Butters : But, sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
Stephen : Don't talk back to me! ''[Butters goes inside]''
Sgt. Yates : We'll send a bill for the damages, ''[the officers turn and leave]'' but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? ''[Stephen closes the door]''
+++++Butters' house, inside. Linda meets Stephen at the foot of the stairs as he has words with Butters+++++
Stephen : Go up to your room, now! ''[Butters goes upstairs]''
Linda : What's going on?
Stephen : Butters started an Asian turf war!
Linda : Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
Stephen : I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.
+++++Center for Criminally Insane Children. Inside, a doctor is in a lab with Butters as Linda and Stephen wait outside. The doctor opens the door and sighs. He meets with Butters' parents.+++++
Stephen : Well, Dr. Janus?
Dr. Janus : I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
Linda : What?
Dr. Janus : There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named "Postman Butters" and yet another is "Fireman Butters." And then there's even "Inspector Butters" and uh, "Professor Chaos".
Linda : Oh my God!
Dr. Janus : From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.
Linda : Oh, poor Butters!
Stephen : Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?
Dr. Janus : No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point. ''[glances at Butters]'' What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.
+++++News report, outside the two Asian restaurants, day+++++

Linda : Now he thinks he's a truck driver. ''[cries into Stephen's shoulder]''

Mr. Takiyama : Oh, you mean a treaty?
Tuong Lu Kim : What the fuck is a tweaty?
Mr. Takiyama : No no, a treaty.
Tuong Lu Kim : A tweaty? ''[no response]'' Rook rook. All these racist people thinka that a Chinese and a Japanese are the same, right? So you and me, we put on a big assembry for all the kids are school, and then everyone understand curtural difference.

Butters : Sure.
Dr. Janus : What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
Butters : Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
Dr. Janus : You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
Butters : Sure.
Dr. Janus : I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.

Butters : Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
Dr. Janus : And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
Butters : Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
Dr. Janus : He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
Butters : What? Why would I do that?
Dr. Janus : Who am I speaking to now?
Butters : Me, Butters.
Dr. Janus : Ah, Butters. You're back.
Butters : Sir, I'm confused.
Dr. Janus : I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
Butters : Really?
Dr. Janus : Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.
Alias 1 : ''[a teenaged personality]'' Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.
Butters : Pardon me?
Alias 1 : He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.
Dr. Janus : Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.
Psycho Janus : Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!
Dr. Janus : Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?

Dr. Janus : What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?
Butters : Yes!
+++++Butter's bedroom, later. He's looking at a video he took of himself on his computer+++++
Butters : ''[a recording]'' This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
Butters : Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie ''Paranormal''.
Butters : ''[a recording]'' Well goodnight for now. ''[leaves the desk and goes to bed]'' Goodnight, Butters.
Butters : Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward. ''[fast-forwards three hours and then gasps. At normal speed, his bedroom door opens slowly. A second later, Dr. Janus enters]'' Dr. Janus? ''[nothing happens for three more hours, so Butters fast-forwards to 3:32 in the morning, when Dr. Janus unzips his pants, pulls out his dick and urinates all over Butters, puts his penis away, zips his pants up, and punches Butters HARD several times before running out of the bedroom.

Steven : Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!
Sgt. Yates : Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.

Mr. Takiyama : Get the fuck out before I call police!
Tuong Lu Kim : Please, I admitting it, okay?I fucked you at assembly. There's no way around it. It was verrry sneaky. Kind of like Pearl Harbor. Okay? That was a little sneaky too, huh? Pearl Harbor kind of sneaky; I think we can all be a rittle sneaky sometimes, hm? But that sneaky Chinese man? He's gone! Okay? Okay, if we can have Asian Diversity festival, then we no longer have to deal witha "recial stereotypes." Prease.
Mr. Takiyama : Against my better judgment, I will trust you one more time. But this time, you'd better not rub your hands together when you turn around to walk away.

He looks over and sees Dr. Janus on a child's tricycle glaring at him]'' Waaahh! ''[runs away. As he does, he tosses the Professor Chaos mask back into the cardboard box. Butters runs into the neighborhood park. Dr. Janus chases him down and tackles him there.]''
Dr. Janus : Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help! ''[moments later they are seated on a park bench]'' Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem! ''[stands up and walks around]'' The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!
Butters : ''[sees a couple walking by]'' Um, excuse me?
Dr. Janus : ''[running around the bench to quickly distract Butters]'' No no nonono! Don't call out for help! ''[Dr. Janus opens his sports coat and points to a sidearm]'' He's got a gun.
Butters : Wahh!
Dr. Janus : If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
Butters : Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
Dr. Janus : No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.
Butters : What??
Dr. Janus : You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
Butters : No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
Dr. Janus : You don't understand! For some reason the mean man is getting stronger. You have to help me find out how to stop him! Please! ''[Butters sighs]''

''[Dr. Janus takes over]'' Yes, that was me, but I'm a little busy at the moment. I'll be right back! ''[Mean Guy takes over as Butters enters an attic room or a penthouse floor]'' You'll never turn me in, Inspector Butters! You're dead!
Butters : Waaaa! ''[runs to the end of a hall and knocks on the door found there. The door opens and he falls into a room. He looks up and gasps at what he sees: walls covered in newspaper headlines about City Sushi and its chef, and one word written in blood: KILL.

I'm going to put an end to you, and everyone gonna think it's just because you did what Japanese people ruve doing most. "No, don't do it! Don't kill yourself, prease!" ''[jumps on Mr. Takiyama and grabs him by the throat]''
Mr. Takiyama : Urgh. Fuck you! I'ma not trying to kill myself!
Tuong Lu Kim : "No, don't do it, prease!" ''[some sirens are heard below]'' "So much to rive for!" ''[floodlights quickly find the two chefs, and they stand down]''
