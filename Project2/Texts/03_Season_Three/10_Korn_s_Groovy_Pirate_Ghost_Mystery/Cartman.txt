Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is? That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! ''You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—'' ''—Christmastime is presents for me.'' Eeyyy  Well, ''I'm'' going to Spooky Laboratory! ''[throws open the doors and enters] Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...'' Cool!  Ewww-hoohooo.  Oh-HO, grohoss. Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!  We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary. Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay  and, let's see...  Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas? That's only 72 shopping days left for ''you''! Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.  I can't go with you guys right now. Mom, seriously!  God-damnit, mom!  God, I hate you guys! How?  Spooky spider? You mean, we make something that ''looks'' like a dead body? So where the hell are we going to get a dead body? U-hi think that's a sweet idea! This is gonna be fun! <poem><i>Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too<br />Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.</i></poem>  Ow. ''Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...''  Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud? Heh heh, I'm sweet. <poem><i>Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...</i></poem> We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!" It wasn't me!  Oh, come on, Kenny! You ''never'' have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest! A package? Oh, ''real''ly? Well, I think ''I'' can sign for that! ''I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present! [stops]'' ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  ''[walks up with the doll and jingles] Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.'' Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"  U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!  Uuh, problem, guys. Nno Grandma. Nno Grandma. Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff. How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?  Oh, no! This is ''my'' Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early! Wow, cool! That didn't help at all. Antonio, no!
