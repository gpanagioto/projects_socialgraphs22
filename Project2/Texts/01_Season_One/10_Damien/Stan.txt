Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year? Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too. Whoa, dude! Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'? ''Dude''. You're not supposed to ''tell'' people what to get you for your birthday. Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid? Hey new kid! Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog. What the... ? A ''what''? Hey, Chef. Whoa! Jesus, Jesus! No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil. This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you. Yeah.  Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid. You're gonna fight Satan?  I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday? Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in. Did the Devil show up yet? Holy crap, dude. Satan is ''huge''. Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'. Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart. Bubye, Fart-boy. Hey, Jesus. Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God. Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs. But you're his sparring partner, Chef. Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili. Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid. Whoa, that was cool! Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out! [swings his left arm] Aaanh, he does this all the time. Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've ''got'' to ''fight'', Jesus. Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One! Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't ''settle'' for second-best! She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!  What?  ... Really? Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks. You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'. ''You'' did, Jesus. Nah, I saw it on '''Star Trek'''.  Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan. Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You're leaving already? Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid. Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
