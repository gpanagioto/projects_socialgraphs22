A note?  We need to talk.  My locker? Are you serious? Well, it's just a little messy. Aw, come on. Yeah, alright. What, come on, it's not that bad. My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away. Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box. Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I- Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I- Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that. Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like- Well, I- I guess so, but-  Well no, don't throw that out.  I don't... I don't know. Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding." Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?  Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?  Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like- What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here? What the hell's going on?! Mr. Mackey. Mr. Mackey, what are you doing? Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up! Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me. I'm working on it!  Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip? Oh-Ohhhhhhh. Wait wait, where the hell are we now? Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy! Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey. Dad? Is that you? Where are you? The hell are you doing, dad? Did you come here to help me? Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality! DAD!  Aaaaaagh! Who's that? What the fuck? Mr. Mackey, stop running! Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time. Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding. Shut up! You can do it Mr. Mackey. What the hell? Who are you people? Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own? ...So then why aren't we waking up? Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!  I think I have a better idea. Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with. Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
