All right, everyone, welcome to the Dolphin Encounter here at the Denver Aquarium.  And here they come: this is Trigger and Dolly, uh there's Bubbles. If they come near you you can touch their back just no grabbing please. What whimsical creatures aren't they? All the dolphins you will be encountering today are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Now who would like to get a kiss from one? Uh all right, let's just uh, get you to put your hands, palms down, on the water.
