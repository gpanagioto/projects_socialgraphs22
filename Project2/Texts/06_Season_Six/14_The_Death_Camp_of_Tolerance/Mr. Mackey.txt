M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik.  BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison.   Good luck, m'kay. Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay? Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?
