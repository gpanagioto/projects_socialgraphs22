 Who's this asshole? Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream? Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks! When are we gonna learn magic tricks? Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club? Cool.  Heheh, guess who I am, you guys? Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.  Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you. Cool.  Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you? Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often. He's going to eat his own head. Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person. No you're not. No you're not. No you're not. No you're not. Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize. Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him.  What's he doin' here?  Now how the hell did he do that?   Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!   Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest? What? Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet. That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning. I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou. This is for your own good, Brother Kyle. Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit. At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble! Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die!   . Hey, I was just about to do it. Oh, that's so sweet you guys.
