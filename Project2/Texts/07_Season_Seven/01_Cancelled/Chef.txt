 Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles Say, did any of you children What the? A repeat??  I've been feelin' Déjà vu all mornin', children. I ''knew'' somethin' strange was goin' on! We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away. He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children. That's right. Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice. We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal. Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum. Well, doctor? That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some ''real'' help! That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center ''now''!  And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff. Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did. Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake. Eric, that's enough! It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with! Okay. Now it's funny again. What's it doing? Where is the signal being sent to?  Help! Get in the car, children! Get in the car!  Can you see anything, children?  God damned aliens!  Hold on, children!  I don't think we're outta the woods yet.  That ain't no police!   You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Aw crap! Children!  Jeff!! The aliens took the children upon their ship. Did you find out what the aliens were up to? They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to! Butt sex? Who's havin' butt sex? What the hell is that?! Chaos theory?? Huh? Oh my God! We have to stop them! We have to find a way to stop those aliens!  Oh no.  That doesn't make any Goddamn sense!  Hello there, children! I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it.
