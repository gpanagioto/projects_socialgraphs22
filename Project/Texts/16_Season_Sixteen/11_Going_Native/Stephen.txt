Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?! Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?! Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua. Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault. It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids. You probably think Butters seems somehow... different. It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place. Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing. It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do! You know that's not allowed! Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa. No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.  Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called "hapahui apahoha", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.
