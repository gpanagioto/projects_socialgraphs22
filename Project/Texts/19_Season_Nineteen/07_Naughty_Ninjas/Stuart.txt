 Goddammit! You people all get out of here! 'Cause this is my fuckin' house! Yeah, we've got a bunch of drunk-addict vagrants trespassing on our yard and we need assistance. What are you talkin' about? There's homeless people here and they're scarin' my kids! You need to come do somethin' about this! Why does that matter? God Dammit!  They're not coming! Well that's just too bad! The cops won't come, so there's nobody to scare the homeless away!
