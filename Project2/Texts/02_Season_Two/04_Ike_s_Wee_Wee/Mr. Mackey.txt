Nuh-now, who was that? That is ''not'' appropriate behavior, m'kay? Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again. Uh, okay, okay, that's fine. M'kay.  Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad. You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad. You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions? Yes, Stan? Uhhh, well, I'm not sure. Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana. Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell, ...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on, ...and when it gets back up to me, ...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you... ...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet? No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD. Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney... Boys, are you paying attention? Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet? Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now? Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay? Woh-oh. I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria. You mean I'm ''fired''?  But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana-- But-- Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-m'kay? Wha-what will I ''do'' for money??  Not o-uho-uhokay! Uuuuuugh! Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job. Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay? Ughuh...  Drinkin's bad.  Woah, about the same. Whoa... Is this my house? Why, Mr. Freely? No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that. But I've never taken drugs ''either''. Huuhh? ''Ow'', m'kay?!  Uh, uh-- Whoa, wait! Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?  Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken. Marijuwana's bad. Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay? Oh, good point. No, I don't feel any d-oooohh... Oh, baby, get down, m'kay? Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful!  Oh, man, where am I? Uh, hi, boys, how are you today? Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs. Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?  Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm... Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth? Yeah, baby... The world is so small. I'm free... I'm free... Hi, boys. Are you boys stayin' out of trouble? Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while.  I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit! Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay? I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay? What? Oh, thanks, man.  Sure, man. Finger-paintin's cool, m'kay? Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey! Uh oh hel-m. Hey! Uh-- What the hell is going on?! I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks! I don't want help! But I don't think I really have a problem. I don't really have a family. No, I lost my job before that. Drugs are baad. Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad. I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again. I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will.  M'kay? Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life... Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your ''life'' someday, m'kay? M'kay. M'kay. Okay. Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?
