He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test. Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry? Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?! Where have you been, dude? Aunt Flo? Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin. Here he comes. ''You'' said you could get us money, Cartman! Well, at least he's back to normal. It's okay. Kenny said ''he'd'' get one. That's not cool! It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin? Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good. ''God, will you shut up?!'' Yeah. I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again. You seem tired, Stan. Why? Hoh, that sucks, dude. Cartman? You ''can't'' be standing there, Cartman. Because you're standing over ''there''! Uh, Chef? Chef. Chef. Chef! We have problems! Will you stop saying that word?! Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that? Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me. There can't be ''that'' many pet stores in South Park, dude.  Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book. What? Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?" Like what? You kick ass, evil Cartman! You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like ''our'' Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna ''kill'' him!  Hey, yeah! I almost forgot. Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella." Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve? ''Stop saying "hella," Cartman!'' Leave him alone, butthole! It's the evil pets  We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe!  Which one is the ''good'' Cartman? Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?! Oh no, dude! Damn it!
