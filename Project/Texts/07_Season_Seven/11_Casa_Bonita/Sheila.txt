Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.  Okay, boys. Get in the car.  Oh, hello Chris, Linda. That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday. I'll drive you boys.  Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  He's okay. Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
