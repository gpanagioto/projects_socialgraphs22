Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, "Fags get out." Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward- ...'Scuse me? ...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?! What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!  You four turd balls in my office NOW! You have got me in a lot of trouble!  She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you! Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry! HOW?!
