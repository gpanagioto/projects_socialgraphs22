I have no idea! I TiVo every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did. Okay you guys, check it out.  Dude, it's a good show. Hehaha, heh. That's it? That's all they did? Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?! Uhhh... Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ! Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea. No, ''Muslims'' can't show an image of Mohammad. Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated! All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real! Dad? Are you sure this time? No! Ike? Iiike!  Ike!   I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the ''Family Guy'' episode pulled. Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before. It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together. I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that. I got some sound advice... from an old friend.  Yeah!  I'm set! Let's do this! We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.  Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.  This isn't what I signed up for! I ''like'' ''Family Guy''. Why do we have to get it off the air forever? But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like ''Family Guy''.  You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want ''Family Guy'' off the air. What are you talking about?! I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech. No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show ''you don't like'' off the air!  Ahhh!  You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
