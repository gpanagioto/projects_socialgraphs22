Dude, Kyle, why are you talking about all this? Yeah, he wants it. Dude, you realize we won't get that game 'till Christmas. We could be playing it tomorrow. She's in. Kyle's mom just squatted in the toilet.  You think she'll poop a big enough log?  How can answer that to which we have no knowledge? You want us to steal some of Kyle's mom's poop for you? Yes, we do understand. We just... well, since you're his publicist. we thought that... you could give Mr. Brady our message. [begins crying] Well if Mr. Brady could just, you know, have Kenny stay over at his house for a night. [thinking, "People just keep looking at me like I'm supposed to say something."] So, you're all here to meet Tom Brady too? Kyle, dude, what are you doing here? [Kyle moves forward]
