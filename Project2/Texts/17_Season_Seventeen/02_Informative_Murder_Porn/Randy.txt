Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  ...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show. Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff. Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?! Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row! Yeah, I got lube right here. Yeah-hah!  What the?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock? Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft? What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?! Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock? What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now! Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!  Oh. Well okay, great. NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November! I can't afford DirecTV. No, just the usual cable-company stuff. I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off. Hi. Corey Lanskin? We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults? Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're ''desperate''! We have a hundred ounces of silver.  Why, why would we punch trees?  Watching informative murder porn? Puh, punching trees? Oh, I see. So when does the game start? ...I don't get it. Yes ah, I'm getting it now. No.  I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one. Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond. No, ''I'' know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube? Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back. Yes? No, what happened? Punched his trees, huh? Huh.  That's weird. I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo. Will do, officer. Will... do...   Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks! Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!  Oh crap. Sharon, I'm I'm sorry.   No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us. Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here? It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you.  Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from. Oh yeah? What's that?  Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull! Felt great? Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill ''you'' now. That felt so good! Okay, hang on. Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now. OH! Ohoho, you bitch!  Ohohunh. I love you too babe.  OH!
