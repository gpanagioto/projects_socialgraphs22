 Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher? Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful? Wooof! I've got to meet ''this'' woman. That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other... Thaat's ''right''! That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it... Oh, hello.  I'm Chef. I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground. Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place. What was your name again? ''Well'', I'm sure there's no substitute for ''you''. If we can have dinner tonight.  Hello there, children. Not too good. No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team. Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion. Don't you understand? She's a ''lesbian''. You boys don't know what a lesbian is? Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians. Now move along, children, you're holding up the line!
