Butters, for the last time, you can't go to Build-A-Bear! Yes, they're open, but we are not the Johnsons, and we do not go to nonessential businesses when it's nonessential!  What the? What's going on now?! Well are we protesting or are we rioting? Stay here, Butters.  Yeah, what happens when my son is sitting in a room with Craig Tucker, whose father doesn't even wear a mask outside? Well, it's really not a mask if you wear it down around your chin. That's a chin diaper. Spoken like a true redneck! What new teachers? Are you out of your mind? You expect people to wear a diaper over their nose? That's disgusting! Fuck you, Fauci!  Butters?! Butters, you get back to quarantine or you are gonna be grounded! I'm not wearing a damn diaper over my nose! Yeah, we care way more about what's right than you do, bitch!  It's the pangolin. So, so what happens now?
