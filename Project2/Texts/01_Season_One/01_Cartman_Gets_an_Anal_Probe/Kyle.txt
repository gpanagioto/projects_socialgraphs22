Ike, you can't come to school with me.  Dude, don't call my brother a dildo! Well, I don't know... and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either! Well, what? Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby! Kick the baby. Really? What about? Totally! Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows. Yeah, fat boy saw it! What's an anal probe? Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman? We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass. Why you walkin' so funny Cartman? No, Ike, go home. This is it. This one's for the game. Kick the baby! Damn it, he's still there. No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.  Oh, my God! Ike!  STOP THE BUUUUUS! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus! But I have to get off! No. But I... Arrghh! We have to do something! What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.   Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"  "You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?" Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now. No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.  Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class? I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you! Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class? Damn it! Damn, Cartman! Dude, he's farting fire! Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger. Dude, what does the note say? Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her. Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back. Bad. Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you? No! Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up. That was cool! Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me. Okay, so how do we get my little brother back? He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors! Hey! If you Visitors can hear me- -bring me back my little brother, God damnit! Give me back my brother! You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack! Damn it, we were so close! Now do you believe us, Cartman? Cartman, they killed Kenny! He's dead, Cartman! Go on and go home, you fat chicken! You're all I have left, Stan. You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! Rats. Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now. You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do. Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother? Just make sweet love down by the fire. ...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed. Why? Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman.  Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop. How come the Visitors aren't coming for him? Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come! Sure you do! Fart, damn you! Whoa, look at that. Uh, uh... Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing. Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again. Did it work? Hey, you scrawny-eyed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child! You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump! Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on! Ike! Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career! Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike. Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner.  Yeah, we're running out of friends. Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school. Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
