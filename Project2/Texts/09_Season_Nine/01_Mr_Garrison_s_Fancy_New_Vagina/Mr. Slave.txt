No thanks. I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought. But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas! It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel! How can you say that?! You're gay too! Oh, Jesus Christ!
