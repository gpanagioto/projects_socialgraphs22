They're going well, Tom. Thank you. You know, what happened to me could happen to any worker at a fulfillment center. I'm speaking to Congress here and then heading back to Colorado tomorrow via UPS. How is the common worker kept submissive? By the institutions and the ideology of the bourgeoisie. We only ask for compassion, for a fair share of the fruits of our labors.   Yeah. You're Jeff Bezos. This isn't about revenge, Bezos. It's about the production of too many useful things resulting in too many useless people! Damn you! You made everything nice and convenient, didn't you, Bezos?! But humans are more than consumers!  What are you gonna do to me? Oh my God...
