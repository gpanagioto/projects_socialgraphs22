Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us!   Dad? Dad! What are you doing?! Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.  Dude, we are total rock stars now!  Hang on. Yeah? Yeah, we did.  Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager! That'd be awesome! Wow, this is a huge party. Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News!  Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos! Are you serious?? Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday. Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us. Yeah dude, that's almost impossible. Really? That'd be sweet. What, you mean, Kyle? But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system. Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level? Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"?  ...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick. This is um, Thad Jarvis. Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincade thinks I should play with Thad for a while. I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part. Don't put this all on me, Kyle! You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,- Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true! Let's just do this, all right?  It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.  Huh? Hero-Heroin Hero? And there's no score? No crowds?  Dude, this is awesome. Ugh. Damnit.  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?! Yeah? Well, I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick! Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music ''I'' wanna play! We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song! You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did! I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time!  Man... Just, just a little. I know, but it mellows me out, okay?! No problem. Huh? What, uh? The dragon. Where did it go? No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game! I just wanna find something else to play. I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that? Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes? Please, it- it won't take long. I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better.  Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there. That isn't it at all.  I know. I need you.  ...with my best friend.  Yeah. I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it. What, you mean it?  All right, dude, let's do this.  Aw, Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox! No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero! You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad!  Mom, will you get Dad out of here? That's it?
