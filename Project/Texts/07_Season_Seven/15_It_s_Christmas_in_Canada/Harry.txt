My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption.  We were told that you might be the- It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby. We want to take Peter home, to Canada. Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home. He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind. Please, don't make things any harder for Peter. We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that! Come on, Peter, we should get going.  I have some chocolate. We're going to take good care of him.  Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way.
