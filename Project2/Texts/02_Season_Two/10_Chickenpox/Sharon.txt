But what's wrong with her? No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.  Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.  Will my daughter be okay? Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go. ...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape ''now'', but if she were in her twenties, she could ''die''. So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should ''intentionally'' have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young. So it's not such a crazy idea after all? Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final. Okay, lemme see. Oh, goody! You've got a fever! Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright. Oh, gee, I guess you did. All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.  Stanley, can I get you anything else? Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up! Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay. Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?  Oh God, what have we done? Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick. Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good. Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper. Yeah, and then we're going to the movies. You mean Stanley's missing?  Oh my God! Our son ran away! ''Die?'' Oh God, no! Stanley?  Oh, Stanley, where are you..? Stanley! Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You ''have'' to get back to the hospital for a shot! Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?  The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow. What's so funny, you two?  Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.
