I know, that song is so awesome.   You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him? Deliberating "Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse"? Millie has the floor. Sunshine sparkle. Wendy has the floor. Why would she do that? Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father owns the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.  Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one! Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!  AAGH!
