Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby. You have to share your room with the baby! The baby! 
Okay, my turn.  Hi Stan! Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan! Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan! Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world??  All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon! All right, you rascals. Gather round.  Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s. And we all know what happened then, don't we? Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor! Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan.  
Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time. 
 Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school. Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black. Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person. 
In the dining room Michael! Let's go!  Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.  We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and- 
This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen. What the heck?   Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that? 
So young man, I understand that you and my daughter have started a romance. And I suppose you have a thing for Canadian girls, huh? Is that it? You've got maple fever? I'm sore-y, Charlotte, but I get suspicious. It's bad enough we have to live in America, now all the boys with maple fever are gonna wanna have at our daughter.
