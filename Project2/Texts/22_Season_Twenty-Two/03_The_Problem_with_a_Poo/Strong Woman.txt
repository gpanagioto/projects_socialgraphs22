Yes, PC Principal? What would we need to discuss?! Hey! I am a strong woman, all right?! I don't get manipulated! We both are guilty of an ill-advised relationship at the workplace, but that was long ago, and I have decided to move forward. Why not? We make a mistake, we move forward. Nope! We're just gonna forget about it and put it to rest. No, I don't! Bye-bye.  That's right, kids. Many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives. They can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown person's sperm in a lab.  Ooohhhhhhh!  Oh! Ooohhhhhhh! I'm fine! That's my water breaking. Not a big deal.   I didn't need your help! Yeah, well, people might get the wrong idea! I have worked my whole life to be the strongest woman possible, a person little girls could look up to. If those girls thought I was the type to get knocked up by my boss- There's nothing to discuss! I made a mistake and I am MOVING FORWARD! My babies! Where are they? You shouldn't be here! People will start getting suspicious! Nobody took advantage of me! And I'm a strong woman! Oh yes, that curriculum should be fine for the students. I'll start working on an all-school proposal. It's okay. Shhh. We just need to get some diapers. Shhh. Thank you. Oh no, no, they're not very PC at all. They actually aren't PC. Oh God, shhhh, nonononono. Sheee. I told you we need to shop separately! Sh! Shhh! They're so PC, like... whoever their father is.  We did the most un-PC thing imaginable. Think about what that would do to them. We can never let them know the debaucherous, sickening circumstances that brought them into this world. And I'll be their strongest vice principal, and hopefully... the world will calm down and not do anything to upset them.
