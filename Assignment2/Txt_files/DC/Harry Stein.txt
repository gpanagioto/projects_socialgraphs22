Harry Stein shows up next in ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' (vol. 2) #2, heading for a meeting with his boss, Valentina Vostok.<ref>''[[Doom Patrol]]'' (vol. 2) #2 (November 1987)</ref> Harry later makes it inside Kalki's complex (father of [[Celsius (comics)|Celsius]]), and shuts down the electrical plant long enough for the Doom Patrol to free themselves from Kalki's traps.<ref>''Doom Patrol'' (vol. 2) #3 (December 1987)</ref> Harry promises to leave any mention of [[Joshua Clay]]'s double identity as doctor Johnathan Carmichael out of his reports.<ref>''Doom Patrol'' (vol. 2) #4 (January 1988)</ref> Harry later informs the Doom Patrol that the Agency needed them to rescue an American superhero who had been taken hostage in [[San Salvador]].<ref>''Doom Patrol'' (vol. 2) #5 (February 1988)</ref>

===Checkmate===
{{main|Checkmate (comics)}}
Harry Stein is appointed Valentina Vostok's replacement in the Agency's command position by [[Amanda Waller]]. Stein later sought out the most stable personnel available from the American and international intelligence and law enforcement communities to form Checkmate. His agency would field only the best-trained and well-equipped of agents, working under the strictest rules of secrecy. For the organizational structure of the re-organized Agency, Stein chose the game of [[chess]] as his working model.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #598 (March 1988)</ref> 

Stein brought in Gary Washington (Knight One) and [[Black Thorn (comics)|Black Thorn]] as operatives, both of whom were his friends, and both of whom were introduced during his run on Vigilante. Harry Stein's sons Barry and Matthew are introduced in ''Checkmate'' #2.

On a rare vacation with his sons, Harry confronts a murderous gang of thieves robbing the payroll of a popular and extensive amusement park. Harry deals with the gang, mostly on his own. Months later, he almost loses one of his sons to a killer's bullet. Harry Stein's last recorded appearance was in ''Checkmate'' #33 (January 1991), the final issue of the original series.

==Notes==
* When first introduced in ''Vigilante'' #23 and throughout his run in that series, Harry was drawn as slovenly and unshaven, in the mould of [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]].
* In ''Action Comics'' #598 and ''Checkmate'' #2, Harry is shown as a clean cut level headed father.
