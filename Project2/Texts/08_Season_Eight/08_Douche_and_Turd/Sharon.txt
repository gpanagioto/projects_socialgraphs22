How was school today, Stanley? ...What did you say? Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?! Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms. It's sexist, is what it is! Are you calling me ignorant?! I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch!  You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.  Oh, Randy! Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?  You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
