 Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow ''Terminator'' rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to ''Back To The Future'' rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, ''Timerider'' rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay. Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived!  It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for ''his'' family. Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish? Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?  Young man, what do you think about all this?
