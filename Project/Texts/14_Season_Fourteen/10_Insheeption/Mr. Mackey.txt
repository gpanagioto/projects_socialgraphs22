Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter?  Hoarding? M'kay, what's that? Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay? Me? ...Like, like what? DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKING MOUTH! M'KAY?! M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uh-kay? What?! What?! Jesus, what?!  Mmm-kay... Billy, ...Billy Thompson? Ohhhhhhh, m'kay. I sure did. I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?
