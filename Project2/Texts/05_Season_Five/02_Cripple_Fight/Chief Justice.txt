In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts ''must'' allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club! And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!
