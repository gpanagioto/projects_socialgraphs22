Butters can't come out and play, boys. ''He'' thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that ''I'' have to ''pay'' for! You made a goofy face!  ...Don't you make that face at ''me'', young man! Stop it! Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week!
