 Look Dad, a whole new bicycle! I'll win the bike parade for sure!  Yeah, I guess I'm lookin' forward to it.  I guess my bike could be in the bike parade. I... I hadn't really thought about it. Oh yeah.    Hey Dad? I don't need anything more. I mean, if I don't win that bike parade, I don't care. I have you guys, and... that's more important than a bike parade will ever be. No I don't Dad. Hey, Mom. Hi Dad.
