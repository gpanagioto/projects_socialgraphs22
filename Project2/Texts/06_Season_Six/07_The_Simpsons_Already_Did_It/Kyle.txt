Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning. See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed. Oh God! Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable! We don't know who else to talk to. Wow, I guess this really ''is'' a big deal.  Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright. Ms. Choksondik stinks inside.  Quick. Hide.  Got it! It is? Oh, really??  I'm so glad we're not murderers.  Whoa.  Whoa. Well what are ''you'' gonna do? Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman. Huh. Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us?  ...Yeah. So? Hey! It's Tweek. The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side. Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
