 Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them. Would you rather them do it unprotected? Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected. Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty. No, you have to change it.
