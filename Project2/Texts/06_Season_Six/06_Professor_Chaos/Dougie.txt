I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!  Hey Butters. I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class. I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you. Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.  I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing. Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too? General Disarray. It's on all the way. Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live? What do we do now?  What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?
