Dammit, Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly kid in line?! Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like.  Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all? Alright, we'll put a sheet over him. Obviously, the terrorists are for real!  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah. You won't believe it... Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!
