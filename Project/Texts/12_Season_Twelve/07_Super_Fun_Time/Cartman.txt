Let's be partners, Kenny. Okay.  Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.  Uh who else needs a partner? God damn it! That isn't necessary! You can let go now, Butters. Butters, come on! I wanna shoot an Indian. Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything! Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme! Fine, then let go of my hand! Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?! Fine, then you're comin' with me! Butters, let go God-damn it! Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay! All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  One please. Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first? Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars!  Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss! <poem><i>I'm having a super fun time playin</i></poem> Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  <poem><i>''Super fun time, please don't go awahay.''</i></poem> <poem><i>No more worries or cares, super fun time.</i></poem>  Oh man, whoa! Yeheah, we're wired up!  <poem><i>You make my life so right, super fun time.</i></poem> Aw, just a few more things. Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on.  Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village. Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.  Crap, they called the cops on us. They must have realized we left. Damn.  Shhh! Butters! Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this! Butters, l-listen to me, listen. All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along. If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand. Butters? All right, come on!  Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free. Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Go easy. Good. It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP. Save me! ... Oh dude, laaame. Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go! Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump! Ready? Go!  Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters? Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm. Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome. What'd we do? We've been here the whole time. Butters. Jesus Christ!  AAAAH!
