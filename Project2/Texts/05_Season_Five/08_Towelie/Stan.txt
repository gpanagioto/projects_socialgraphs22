HA, I blew your head off! Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom? Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet. Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game! Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.  What is it, Mom? The 2001 Okama GameSphere? There it is. The Okama GameSphere.  What's that? Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday! What? Dude, we got GameSphere. What? ...O-kay. No.  G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere. Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit! Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball. Okay, we will. Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it! No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer. Oh, uh, I'm sick. But Mom... Can't believe we have to go to school! We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere.  Fine. This is gonna be one looong-ass day.  That was the longest day of school ever! It... it was right here. Hello? What? Who-who is this? Don't hurt it!  They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere. Towelie! I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him. This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him. Hey yeah.  Let's go waterskiing! Come on, dude!  They said the gas station outside of town. Who is that?  'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games. You ''called'' us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back. Goddamnit, what now?!   Where is our Okama GameSphere? Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie? Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys.  A little more gas, Kenny.  Brake, Kenny, brake.   Dude, don't you remember where it is? Alright, so where is it? Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you! What? Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is? We don't care. Dude, we don't care. We... don't... care.  Don't care, don't care, don't care. Can you tell us where "that" is, please? We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf? Yeah.  What? So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?  Hurry up, stupid parachute! Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks. Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  No, Towelie, the entry code! God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence. Do you have our Okama GameSphere? Oh God, don't care, don't care. So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp. But we don't care! We're just going in to get our video game back. Hello? Hello, anybody here?  Ohmigod, look!  Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays.  Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny! Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart!   Aw, crap! Come on, guys. Let's go play video games! Oh, dude, we finished level 50! Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
