+++++


A very blurry image appears onscreen, but it begins to sharpen ever so slowly... It's Cartman, thinking back over the season's events.

Cartman

I don't know where to start. First, it was all the school shootings, then these Wi-Fi scooters showed up, and now we know that ManBearPig is real and we could all be dead in a matter of years.

Doctor

[slowly] And you believe this all relates somehow to the movie Black Panther not being as good as everyone says it was?

Cartman

I know there's a connection. But that isn't what matters. I can't deal with people anymore. It's just... everyone sucks so hard, you know? Everybody is so stupid. And they all walk around going "Nya na chai cha nyachacha chai cha." And the only thing that makes me happy, the only thing I can trust... is this. [holds up his phone] But... all people do is try to keep me from it. [memories show up onscreen.]

+++++


Cartman's Bedroom. He is reclining back with his legs on top of his computer desk, smiling...while playing with his phone. Liane stops by and opens the door.

Cartman

I'll be in my room and my mom will come in and say...

Liane

[Cartman imitates her]"Eric, that's enough time on your phone!" [she leaves as Cartman frowns, then lowers his eyelids]

+++++


South Park Elementary, forth grade classroom. Cartman is on his phone again, smiling, while Mrs. Nelson has some multiplication problems written on the chalkboard.

Cartman

And then at school...

Mrs. Nelson

[Cartman imitates her] "Eric!" [he stops looking at his phone as Mrs. Nelson addresses him] "What are you doing? You can't use your phone at school!" [Cartman begins to frown again]

+++++


South Park Elementary, playground. Some of the forth grade boys are playing football and trying to block each other. Cartman is on his phone again, smiling and holding the football, with his back turned towards the game.

Cartman

And even my friends. My own friends! They'll be like...

Stan

[Cartman imitates him] "Hey Cartman! Throw us the ball. You're the goddamn quarterback!" [Cartman droops]

+++++


Doctor's office. Cartman is back on the chair.

Cartman

It's like, everybody needs something from me. All I want is a little time with my phone instead of always listening to people's needy bullshit. [a second or two of silence, then Cartman looks over and sees the doctor playing with his own phone.]

Doctor

Oh ahh, d'ya, sorry. Just... [puts his phone away] Uh, well, you know, young people have so much to deal with today. I believe that what you have is... anxiety.

Cartman

Anxiety? Is that cool?

Doctor

It's pretty common these days. What it really is, more than anything is an excuse to be lazy and lame to everyone around you.

Cartman

[sits up] Oh my God, that's perfect!

+++++


PC Principal's office, day. He's playing on his smartphone when a call comes in on the school's intercom

PC Principal

I'm busy. [the intercom beeps again]

Ms. Blaze

Mr. Principal?

PC Principal

I'm busy doing stuff! [beep] What?!

Ms. Blaze

The vice principal needs to speak with you. She says it's urgent. [PC Principal sighs]

+++++


The Vice Principal's office. PC Principal arrives there looking around

Mr. Mackey

[surprising him] Oh, PC Principal!

PC Principal

Uh-uh yes?

Mr. Mackey

Are you going in to see the vice principal? I really need to speak with her.

PC Principal

Uh yeah, we just uh, we're having an important scheduling to go over.

Mr. Mackey

Everything is okay with you two? There's no more "inappropriate behavior"? You know, as a counselor, I'm here to-

PC Principal

That's in the past, Mackey! We've paid our dues, and we're not hiding anything anymore.

Mr. Mackey

Mmm-m'kay. [turns left and continues on his way. PC Principal turns around and opens the door, then goes in]

+++++


The Vice Principal's office, inside. The office is a nursery and the PC babies are throwing stuff around and crying.

Strong Woman

[frustrated] I could use a little help here!

PC Principal

What's going on??

Strong Woman

Riley said a word her sister felt was insensitive to Muslims. Now they're all upset.

PC Principal

All right, what word did you use, Riley?!

Strong Woman

She just said "Aba daba."

PC Principal

Look, can't we put them in a daycare?

Strong Woman

Oh, yeah. That would be really smart. If anybody sees them, they're gonna figure out you're the father.

PC Principal

Well maybe they won't!

Strong Woman

You wanna risk that? The babies have to stay hidden because if people know the truth, then you're not PC and I'm not strong! [she leaves the office, looking both ways before closing the door]

+++++


A restaurant, day. Cartman is at a table waiting for service, but also on his phone tapping away

Waiter

[arrives, smiling] All right, can I take your order? [Cartman ignores him until he speaks again] Excuse me. [Cartman puts his hand up for a moment] What would you like, sir?

Cartman

Just a God- can you wait?! Isn't that your job?! Aren't you a wait-er?! [the waiter walks away, eyeing him. Cartman starts a video game. The noise from the game eventually catches the attention of a nearby diner]

Diner

Hey, could you turn your phone down, kid? This is a restaurant.

Cartman

It just so happens I have anxiety! That means I have trouble being around assholes who won't leave me alone! [leaves his chair]

+++++


The streets downtown. Cartman walks down a sidewalk when a cyclist whizzes past him and rings the bike's bell. He looks but lets it go and continues walking. He crosses an intersection. He then approaches Tele's, where the owner is sweeping the front entrance and then notices Cartman.

Tele's owner

Oh, hello, Eric.

Cartman

Shut up. I have anxiety. [approaches another intersection when an elderly man tries to get his attention]

Pedestrian

Hey kid! [Cartman is visibly annoyed] Hey kid!

Cartman

[turns around and yells out in anger] I'm on my phone!!

Pedestrian

You're about to get hit by a car! [a car goes by behind Cartman]

Cartman

[just angered] All right, that's it! Everyone stop! Just fucking stop right now! [traffic stops moving and everyone stops to listen] Listen up, people! I have anxiety! That means I'm in my shell and have a hard time expressing myself! I find it difficult to engage with others! So everyone shut the fuck up because my anxiety is up here right now!

+++++


A commercial. Zen music plays as the camera pans down to a Buddha statue in a garden complete with waterfall

Announcer

We live in a world of many distractions. It's hard to find peace.

+++++


A woman sits alone on a park bench on a sidewalk, looking at her phone. She then notices people all around her are looking at their phones as well

Announcer

In the hustle and bustle of modern times, we've lost the one thing we all need. [The scene freezes with the woman now smiling and the caption, "More quality one-on-one time with our phone" appears next to her]. More quality one-on-one time with our phone.

+++++


A blonde female pulls up a cardboard box from the bottom of the screen and holds it up, revealing it to be the Buddha Box.

Announcer

But now you can have it with Buddha Box. [a cardboard box with a "DO NOT DISTURB" sticker on the front, a drawing of Buddha above the product name "Buddha Box" and an antenna on the side. The woman proceeds to put it over her head] Simply fit the patented box on your head and set its Bluetooth to your mobile device.

+++++


A 3D rendered model of the Buddha Box with its internal workings is shown, along with the captions "FRONT PROJECTION 4K SCREEN", "CELLULAR ANTENNA" and "NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES"

Announcer

Inside Buddha Box, your phone is projected two inches from your face, and the noise-canceling headphones let you hear your phone without any outside noise, giving you peace from...

+++++


Inside a car that is stuck in traffic, an Uber driver is talking non-stop while a businessman in the backseat is visibly annoyed.

Announcer

That annoying Uber driver who wants to talk. [the businessman puts the Buddha Box over his head while the driver doesn't seem notice.]

+++++


A business office. A female office worker is at her cubicle and using her smartphone. A male co-worker starts to approach her.

Announcer

Those people at work who act like they need stuff. [As the co-worker is about to speak to her, she notices and immediately puts the Buddha Box over head and goes back to her phone]

+++++


A living room. A blonde male turns and looks into the camera as his three kids run around the room, playing with toy swords and a rocket and then jump on the couch.

Man

I want to be enlightened, like the Buddha, but I've got these fucking kids.

+++++


A family dining room. The blonde male has the Buddha Box over his head and plays with his phone, while his wife desperately tries to calm the kids down.

Announcer

Let Buddha Box take you to a place of peace and serenity, [the man is transported from the dining room to a heavenly atmosphere, floating above the clouds...while still looking at his phone] where you can have quality, uninterrupted time with your phone.

+++++


A bedroom. A woman is sitting on her bed and removes the Buddha Box from her head.

Woman

I was stressed out and feeling anxious. After just 8 to 10 hours in Buddha Box, I feel refreshed and ready to take on anything.

+++++


The woman's husband appears by the door and leans in to talk to her.

Husband

Babe, can you please come say hi to my mother while she's here? [she just reaches over and drops the Buddha Box on her head and picks up her phone]

Announcer

[The Buddha Box is shown rotating as it approaches the center of the screen] Order Buddha Box today and you too can have that quiet, quality time with your phone. Like... the Buddha. [The Buddha Box logo is shown. Suddenly it has a Buddha Box over its head and a phone in its hands]

+++++


South Park Elementary, day. Cartman stands in the hallway with his Buddha Box on. Kevin walks past him, staring. Kyle and Stan walk around the corner and stop when they reach him

Kyle

What the hell is that?

Stan

I think it's Cartman.

Kyle

What is it doing?

+++++


Inside the Buddha Box. A close up of Cartman's face is shown, along with reflections from his iPhone screen, though they are all reversed.

Cartman

[out loud, but the Buddha Box is soundproof, so no one else can hear him] Ha! That's so sweet! [A Youtube page with an image of a guy covered in pasta titled "Guy hit by pasta!" and has 67,453 views] That video seriously made me laugh! [closes the app and returns to the iPhone home screen] Let me check my e-mail again! [opens an email app] Oh man, nothing from Lorenz yet? Whatever. Weak.[returns to the iPhone home screen] Oh! I gotta see that post from Clyde again! [goes and opens Instagram. A post from "ClydeTheMan" is shown, with a selfie of Clyde smugly looking into the camera. Behind him is Butters, who appears to be unconscious and laying on his back out on the sidewalk. It has the caption, "Guess who I found? #dead" and 110 likes. Kyle and Stan stay by Cartman until the bell rings, then they go to class.]

+++++


The boys bathroom. Craig is at the urinal. Somehow, Cartman makes his way inside and wanders over to the urinals. He stands right next to Craig and drops through.

Craig

Dude! [Cartman bumps into him] Dude, what the hell are you doing?!

Cartman

What? What? Who is that?

Craig

Get off of me!!

Cartman

[raises his Buddha Box] Oh, sorry Craig. Didn't see you there.

Craig

Yeah, 'cause you got a stupid box on your head! [finishes up, zips up his pants, and flushes the urinal, then walks away]

Cartman

Oh, there's nothing stupid about it. Don't you wish you had a way to deal with your anxiety?

Craig

[stops, then turns around] My anxiety?

Cartman

I see it in you, Craig. With your parents and relationships? Imagine being able to shut them out for a little while, Craig, so you can focus on what matters. With Buddha Box you can cut out all the unwanted noise. Not have to deal with conversations that are of no interest to you.

Craig

Well, I have to admit: sometimes, when me and Tweek are together it's... it's like he wants my atten- [Thump. Cartman has lowered his Buddha Box over his head. Craig turns around, dismayed, and walks out. Cartman turns left and steps up to the urinal]

+++++


The Fourth Grade classroom, day. The bell rings and Mrs. Nelson walks up to the chalkboard to erase the multiplication problems that were there

Ms. Nelson

All right, children, we have a lot to go over for today's quiz. Who can tell me where we left off? [turns around and notices Cartman wearing his Buddha Box] Eric. [no reaction] Eric Cartman.

+++++


Inside the Buddha Box. A close up of Cartman's face is shown, along with reflections from his iPhone screen, though they are all reversed.

Cartman

[looking at the website, "Thrown Tomatoes", with a picture and reviews for the movie "Creed II"] Thirty-four million dollars box office? How the hell does Creed II do $34 million opening weekend? [begins to flip through his apps] What's the weather like tomorrow? [The weather forecast screen shows it is 22 degrees and sunny in South Park] Oh, it's snowing? I gotta tell Lorenz. I- [as he attempts to access the email app, the Box comes off his head, and the light blinds his eyes] Whoa, whoa! Hey!

Mrs. Nelson

[holding Cartman's Buddha Box] What do you think you're doing?

Cartman

Excuse me, that's my Buddha Box.

Ms. Nelson

You aren't using this during class time.

Cartman

It relaxes me. Ask my therapist. I have anxiety, you dumb bitch! [Mrs. Nelson and the rest of the class gasp at his remark]

+++++


The Principal's office. Cartman has earned a trip there for calling his teacher a "dumb bitch"

PC Principal

I don't know what makes you think you're different from everyone else, but nobody gets away with slandering teachers at this school!

Cartman

[to his phone] Uhuh. Aw man, that looks, that looks sweet.

PC Principal

Hey! [no reaction] HEY! [Cartman peeks out from under the box, then looks at PC Principal]

Cartman

Oh, PC Principal. Hello.

PC Principal

Just what do you think you're doing?

Cartman

[as Zen music plays] I'm letting go of stress and being calm, like the Buddha.

PC Principal

There are no boxes on your head in school!

Cartman

Hey. Whoa man, what's going on? Are you suffering from anxiety?

PC Principal

What are you talking about?

Cartman

It's okay. I have it too. Anxiety is very real. But there is help for people like us.

+++++


Strong Woman's living room, day. The PC Babies have taken over it and are causing damage as PC Principal sits on the sofa wearing a Buddha Box. Strong Woman comes in and surveys the damage

Strong Woman

What the fuck are you doing?! [walks up and removes the Box from his head] Hey! What the fuck are you doing?!

PC Principal

Oh hey, I just needed to answer a couple of e-mails really fast.

Strong Woman

With a box on your head?!

PC Principal

I got one for you, too. [gets off the sofa and gets it to show her] It's Buddha Box. [no reaction] Look, you and I have been having a lot of problems. Clearly, what we both need is more quality one-on-one time with our phones.

Strong Woman

I don't need a box on my head to use the phone!

PC Principal

I'm sorry! [takes the box to the sofa and dumps it there] I was trying to be helpful! [gets his Buddha Box and leaves. One of the girls tries to pull a rabbit away from one of her brothers]

Strong Woman

All right, Riley. Give that back to your brother. [the brother chases Riley. Another brother goes to an end table and pulls the lamp off it, breaking the light bulb] Bailey, no! [a third brother sees some paper wads and begins to chew on one of them] Harper, don't! Har-per! [picks up her phone and starts using it. Then she looks at the Buddha Box and puts it on her head. The babies stop crying and begin to crawl or walk away. They pass by the restroom. Riley stops to open the door to show PC Principal on the toilet, and Harper looks on. They then move out]

+++++


Montage. The babies leave the house and wander the town. Bailey sits on a mailbox drop slot. Riley slides off the hood of a car. Harper somehow got on the roof of a building. The other sister walks out of a shop. The kids then take a submarine and ride it in an aquarium with fish and an octopus in it. They study some restrooms and cry over the "Male Only" and "Female Only" designations. Then, they are shown flying upward into the sky with a rainbow behind them. Next, they're in a children's library as the librarian brings out "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" from the American Classics shelf. The babies cry again. Finally the PC Babies logo comes up

All

+++++


Crunchy's Micro Brew, day.

Patron 1

Hey Mike. What's that you're drinking?

Mike

This? Oh, it's a Cosmopolitan. I know, I know, it's a pussy drink. [some babies are heard crying.]

Patron 2

[leans in a bit to say] Hey, be careful, guys. There are some PC babies over there. [the three gents approach the babies.]

Mike

Oh great. Come on, I didn't mean pussy drink as in female genitalia. [the babies don't stop] Okay, I'm sorry! I'll order a Black Russian! [babies cry harder]

Barkeep

Hey, what's all that racket down there?!

Patron 1

Oh, there's some PC babies upset about certain drink descriptions.

Barkeep

Fine, we'll take them off the menu.

Patron 1

Who's makin' a difference? Who's the future? [this brightens the babies' moods as they start to giggle.]

+++++


A soccer field, day. The South Park Cows are facing a visiting team. Kyle and Stan kick the ball back and forth until a visiting player intercepts it and drives toward the Cows' net.

Kyle

Here it comes! Block it! [the player kicks the ball towards the net. Cartman stands there oblivious that there's a game going on. The ball goes cleanly into the net. The player smiles as the whistle blows.] What the fuck, dude?!

Tolkien

What is your goddamn problem?! [he, Kyle, and Stan move towards him]

Cartman

[lifts up his Box] What's going on?

Kyle

They just scored again, you fat fuck!

Cartman

Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm dealing with my anxiety! Do you know how hard it is for people with my condition to come out and even do things like this?! Living with anxiety is awful, huh Craig? [Craig is shown wearing a Buddha Box]

Kyle

Can we get another goalie, please?!

Cartman

Oh yeah! Sure! Yeah, because people with anxiety shouldn't be allowed to play sports! Right, Kyle?! [A Buddha Box sits on Cartman's head.] You know, our world is dark and scary enough without people like you making us feel inferior. [drops his Box over his head again, but lifts it up really quickly.] Asshole! [back down the Box goes]

Tolkien

Fuck this! [walks off angrily] My parents didn't come here to see their son lose by 20 points! Come on, Dad. Let's go! [his anger vanishes] Dad? [Steve Black and a few other parents in the stands are wearing their own Buddha Box]

+++++


Downtown, day. PC Principal drives Strong Woman through town searching for the babies

Strong Woman

River?? Bailey?! Emory?!

PC Principal

It's okay. We're gonna find them.

Strong Woman

I can't believe you were on your phone!

PC Principal

You were on your phone too!

Strong Woman

It was my time to be on the phone! You were on yours all morning!

PC Principal

You're seriously gonna make this all my fault?!

Strong Woman

Yes!

PC Principal

Because last time I checked, you didn't even want me around as a partner to the PC Babies, even though I-

Strong Woman

[rolls her eyes] Oh God, I'm not doing this again.

PC Principal

Even though you need me to do shit for you every [Strong Woman drops her Box over her head] 10 fuckin' minutes! You don't get to just say whatever you- [notices she's no longer listening] Oh. Okay, cool. Fine with me! I'm the one who has a fuckin' problem on their fuckin' phone! [looks at the scenery for a few seconds] You know, usually, I'm afraid to tell you what I really think, but you wanna know something? [looks over] You wanna- you wanna know what I really think? [at no point did Strong Woman remove her Box, and he just drops it.]

+++++


The Park County Recreation Center, day. The doctor is seated with several couples who need help - Tweek and Craig, Liane and Cartman, Ryan and Sarah, Tolkien and Steve. Craig, Cartman, Sarah, and Steve are wearing Buddha Boxes

Doctor

Anxiety can make you feel unable to cope. But living with someone who has anxiety can be a bit of a roller coaster as well. We have to support our loved ones with their anxiety and try to understand their illness.

Tweek

I just feel that Craig has changed so much lately! He barely even talks to me anymore!

Doctor

Well, because his anxiety make him feel like anything he says might sound wrong. That's why we must nurture our loved ones, so they feel safe.

Liane

Eric, I just feel like you have so much to offer the world, and it kills me that you're so afraid to let your inner you shine.

Cartman

[talking to his Buddha Box] Heh heh, that guy's such a douche. What was that... what was that one show he was on?

Doctor

Maybe you, you wanna text him that? [Liane picks up her phone and sends Cartman a message]

Cartman

Oh yeah, that's it. B.J. and the Bear. That show was so dumb. What kind of monkey was that, anyway? What was that- what was that monkey he always had- Wait. What the? What the hell is this? Oh God damnit. [lifts up his Box] Mom, will you stop texting me? I'm trying to relax!

Doctor

Look, we're all just trying to understand this condition, and it's like you're not listening!

Cartman

We're doing everything we can to keep our anxiety under control! Do you think I even wanna be here right now?! I am freaking out!

Tolkien

Can we go now?

Cartman

[to his Buddha Box] Heheh, yeah. That's pretty cool.

+++++


A construction site, day. The workers sit around until the foreman walks up

Foreman

Hey! Hey, what's goin' on here?! Why aren't you people workin'?!

Laborer 1

We can't keep buildin', sir. We got a bunch of protesters who won't let us work.

Foreman

Protesters? Who?

Laborer 1

Ah, it's just a bunch of PC babies who think building this thing is wrong. [leads the foreman to the babies, who are all crying]

Foreman

All right, all right! What do you PC babies want? [the crying continues]

Laborer 1

I guess they're upset because the new viaduct is being financed by a state rather than a county institution.

Foreman

Aw, come on PC Babies! Why does that matter?! [the crying continues]

Laborer 1

I guess the state refused to finance a proposed program on race-relation education, an they see it as hypocritical.

Foreman

God damnit, not everyone cares about race-relation programs! Come on, PC Babies! We got a job to do! [the babies aren't budging and continue to cry]

+++++


Park County Police Station. One officer walks around with a Buddha Box on his head while a desk officer talks to PC Principal and Strong Woman

Desk Officer

All right, all right, just calm down, lady! You want to file a missing persons report?

Strong Woman

No! No, we don't want to file anything specific. We just need help finding some PC babies.

Desk Officer

PC babies? They usually hang out at the liberal arts colleges. You could find some there.

Strong Woman

Nono, it's five specific PC babies.

Desk Officer

Tony, wasn't there a report of some PC babies down at the Mexican border?

Strong Woman

No! No, these PC babies wouldn't have gotten that far! They can barely walk. I'm their mother.

Desk Officer

Hokay, okay. Last name?

Strong Woman

Woman.

Desk Officer

First name?

Strong Woman

[with a breaking voice] Strong.

Desk Officer

Okay, and you're the father?

Both

NO!

PC Principal

I'm her superior at work!

Strong Woman

Don't be ridiculous!

PC Principal

You think I took advantage of my position?!

Strong Woman

I'm not some two-bit floozy who goes around sleeping with her boss! I am a strong woman! Those kids were born naturally by in-vitro fertilization. [they begin to talk over]

PC Principal

I'm not Harvey Weinstein, all right?! I have nothing but respect for females at my workplace, and I would never compromise that position!

Strong Woman

We'll uh, see what we can do. In the meantime you'll just have to take a seat and wait. [they go and find two seats next to a man wearing a Buddha Box. They look around, find some Buddha Boxes on the floor, and put them on.]

+++++


Pi Pi's Water Park, day. A line of people awaits a ride down a water slide called "Hyperbowl". At the head of the line now are Cartman, Kyle, and Stan. Cartman has his Buddha Box on and isn't getting on the slide

Kyle

Go! [no reaction] GO! [thumps the Box to get Cartman's attention]

Cartman

What do you want?

Kyle

Go down the slide or get out of the way!

Cartman

You think I even want to be here, Kyle?! My therapist told me I need to force myself to go out and do things to overcome my anxiety!

Kyle

[to a nearby lifeguard] Can we move him, please?! [the lifeguard is revealed to be wearing a Buddha Box]

Cartman

Oh! Oh, I see! People with anxiety shouldn't be allowed at water parks. Is that it, Kyle? [jumps out of line] Hey everybody! Just so you know, Kyle thinks people with anxiety should just stay home! Yeah! I'm trying to come out of my shell, but Dr. Kyle here is just worried about his place in line.

+++++


Pi Pi's New York Splash, later. Cartman is sunning himself on a towel poolside with his Buddha Box.

Kyle

[approaching] Get! Off! My! Towel! [knocks the Buddha Box off Cartman's head] Get off my towel!

Cartman

God damnit! I seriously can't get a minute of peace! [goes to flip his Box upright as Kyle folds the towel up] Why is it that people who don't have a Buddha Box are always flipping Buddha Boxes off the heads of people with anxiety?!

Kyle

[Stan, Clyde, and Tolkien look on] I got news for you, Cartman! Everyone has anxiety! Everyone gets nervous! Everyone is afraid being around people! Everyone has feelings they'd rather stay home alone! And you know what they do? They get over it. And they stop being a piece of shit! 

Cartman

[subdued] Everyone has anxiety?

Kyle

Yes!

Cartman

Oh my God. I know what I have to do now. Yo-you're right, Kyle! You're right! [hurries away]

Kyle

What? No. No! What did I just do?

Stan

Should have just let him be on his phone, dude.

+++++


Spinny Mountain Records, day

Record Producer

You know what the kids like today? They like music that matters! I think you guys got what it takes to be the next big thing! The PC Babies! [the babies cry] That's what I'm talkin' about! That stuff is raw! Everyone loves you, PC Babies! We're gonna make you famous!

+++++


The recording booth, moment later.

Bruce

All right, PC Babies, let's hear what you got. [Music plays as the babies start thrashing about and cry. Riley's on drums, Bailey's on banjo, Harper's on the piano, River is on the triangle, and Emory is on the xylophone. After a few seconds of recording, Bruce and the record producer hi-five each other.]

+++++


South Park Police Station, day. The desk officer is writing on a clipboard while listening to the radio

DJ

All right, South Park, and now here's that special treat we told you about. Live with us in the studio is a hot new band: The PC Babies. They're gonna perform their new song, which is about the injustice of white people in dreadlocks. It's called "Weeaaagh." [the song recorded earlier plays. The desk officers starts to move his head and snap his fingers to the music. Strong Woman and PC Principal eventually notice]

Strong Woman

[raises her Buddha Box] Riley?

PC Principal

[raises his Buddha Box] Tha-that's Bailey!

Desk Officer

[continues moving his head and snapping his fingers] It's the PC Babies. Guess they're all the rage now.

PC Principal

Cone on! [the couple bolts from their chairs]

+++++


The Mayor's Office, day. Cartman is talking to the Mayor and her aides, now sporting a shaved head, wearing a bathrobe and towel like a Buddhist monk, with his Buddha Box beside him

Cartman

To quiet one's mind, one must have a dialog with one's self. I have found enlightenment. But there are so many others who suffer. It's very important to take the time to shut out the outside world. In the Hindu religion, there's a saying, "Namaste." It means "fuck you, I have anxiety." At first I thought it was only a few of us, but then something was said to me by Kyle. He said "Eric, my friend, everyone has anxiety." I know what you're thinking: "Fuck Kyle." And normally I would agree with you, but hear his words. Everyone has anxiety. We must recognize this disease as an epidemic. Yes, fuck Kyle, but Mayor, we have to raise money to get everyone who has anxiety the tools they need to cope.

Mayor McDaniels

And how do YOU think we get that money? How do YOU suggest we do this?

Cartman

Namaste.

Johnson

Na-ma-ste.

Cartman

Fuck you too.

+++++


WXFU 88.3, day. The secretary has a Buddha Box on her head. The babies and the record producer step off the elevator and head towards the exit.

Record Producer

That was far out, PC Babies! You really rocked the airwaves! Now come on! We got a photo shoot at 5! [PC Principal and Strong Woman burst through the doors]

PC Principal

Kids! [they run past the producer towards the kids.]

Strong Woman

You're okay! Thank God!

Record Producer

Who the hell are you??

Strong Woman

[her and PC Principal pick up the babies] I'm their... vice principal.

PC Principal

Yea, and ah-I'm their principal. We need to get these kids back to school.

Record Producer

You can't do that! These are the PC Babies! Don't you know how big they are?! In just one day they protested a bar, stopped construction of a problematic viaduct, and wrote a hit single about cultural appropriation!

Strong Woman

They.... did all that?

PC Principal

Oh my God. They had their first protests... and we missed it. We missed everything because... we were on our phones.

Strong Woman

I've always used the phone as a way to deal with the stress of having babies nobody could know the truth about, but... it's only made it worse.

PC Principal

You know what we have to do, right?

Strong Woman

Yeah, I think so.

South Park Elementary, cafeteria, day. a PTA meeting is taking place

PC Principal

All right everyone, listen up. The vice principal and I have been discussing student health, and it's our firm belief that they need, and what we all need, is less time on our phones. [the attendees are shown, every last one of them in a Buddha Box tapping away on their phones.] Yes, yes I know it's an unpopular idea, but just hear me out, please. Our phones are the cause of stress, not the relief from it. We are banning phones and Buddha Boxes, and we suggest you all strictly limit their use at home as well. [continued constant tapping]

Strong Woman

[observing the room] I don't think anyone's listening to you.

PC Principal

Yeah... Nobody's listening. And nobody's watching. [puts down the microphone]

Strong Woman

I guess we can wait and ban the boxes tomorrow? [they kiss]

Montage. "Today" by Brad Paisley begins to play. While they kiss, people on the sidewalk in front of the school walk around wearing Buddha Boxes.PC Principal check to see if the coast is clear, then pulls Strong Woman and the five babies out. With everyone wearing Buddha Boxes, the family walks around town happy and free. Next they walk through Downtown. A man crosses the street and is struck by a car, flipping over it and landing on his stomach. Both driver and pedestrian are wearing Buddha Boxes. The parents just gather up the PC babies, knowing they're safe from harm. Next, they're having a picnic at the park. Next, they're in Aspen skiing down the bunny slope. One of the babies slips, and everyone else follows suit. Next, they walk past a fire pit in the lodge. Last scene is of the family eating at Buca de Fagoncini

Brad Paisley


You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
And it just keeps falling and so do I
I am feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today
And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your 
life
