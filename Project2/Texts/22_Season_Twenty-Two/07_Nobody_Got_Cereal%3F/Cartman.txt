Can you get off your god damn video game for five fucking seconds so we can have a conversation?! And that's why we have to break out of here ourselves.  Excuse me? Officer? No, it's not that. It's just...I noticed you're still riding your horse all the way back to camp. No, they don't, but... you can use cinematic mode to make it easier on yourself. Kyle, come on. We've gotta go. I had a vision, Kyle. Al Gore's ghost visited me. Well his ghost visited me, Kyle. He said he had a plan, and we needed to go. Are you in or not? Shhh. What was that? This is where Al Gore told me to go.  What are you doing here, Satan? Us too. But why?  Okay, but what do you want us to-? What are you doing?  No mortal. But what about you? Satan, come on. Are you really gonna stand there and not say you appreciate all the nice things humans have done for you lately? I mean, not sure if you've noticed, but we're pretty much doing things your way up here We can't do this without you, Satan. I can't believe it's the weekend, and I'm at school! Why? Of all the places we could hide, why do I have to sit here in school?! I'd rather be in jail than at school.  Yeah, I guess we're dummies, huh Kenny? Are you crazy? We just saw ManBearPig take down Satan. What the hell are we supposed to do against it?  We just sat in school... for nothing!
