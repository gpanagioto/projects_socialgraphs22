Heidi Turner. She... she quit Twitter. Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good. No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone. Okay. Can we all agree now,  that whoever is doing this, needs to stop? So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it! Clyde's right. What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is. We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go. After school, we're gonna go to my uncle's cabin - in the woods. We're gonna have a slumber party and play ''Counter-Strike'' all night with no one around to bother us. Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food. Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much. You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry. What have we done? You didn't hear? The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night! It wasn't him Kyle! We took Cartman out for no reason.  We can't undo what we've done.
