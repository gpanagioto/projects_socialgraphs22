What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?! It's the dumbest game ever! All you do is collect and spend Canadough! But it's ''not'' free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free! We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun? It's just the way things are going? It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect.  Do you really think that would help? But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!  Okay, but we still won't stand for this! Oh God, he just doesn't stop! Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in ''Devil's Advocate''?! Beelzeboot! Who the fuck is that?
