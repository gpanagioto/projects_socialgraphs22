''Sir'' Elton John. I was knighted, you know. I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan. Chef? You mean ''Chef''-Chef? Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago. I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break. And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music. Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums. Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights,  including-but-not-limited-to-Asian-territories, with-a-twenty-percent-commission-from-all-domestic-sales, and-sole-ownership-of-any-and-all-publishing. Tell Chef I said hi. Howdy ho, boys. It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef. So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over. I see you've got a stage all set up for us. Then, letâ€™s rock and roll! Or something similar. Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy. I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend. <poem><i>Wake up, Wendy!</i></poem> <poem><i>Smell the coffee...</i></poem>
