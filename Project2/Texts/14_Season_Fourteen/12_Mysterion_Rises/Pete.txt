I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.  Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school? Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself.  Who the F'n H is that? It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever. Hardcore goth. Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody. Ugh, whatevs.
