The answer is "no", Stanley! I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays. I'll leave it up to your father.  The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!  I just can't believe he would go without our permission! Well, I hope for ''his'' sake you're right.  Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you? ''Wwhat?!''  Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska! What's going on here?! Is this the Cartman residence? Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!  ''What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!'' Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.
