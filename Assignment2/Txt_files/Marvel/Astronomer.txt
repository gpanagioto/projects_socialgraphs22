The '''Elders of the Universe''' are a group of supervillains appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] was the first Elder to appear, and featured in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #28 (May 1966),<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=121}}</ref> but the idea that he was a member of a group known as the Elders was not introduced until ''The Avengers'' #174 (Aug. 1978).

==Fictional history==
The Elders of the Universe are the last survivors of otherwise [[extinct]] races. Each discovered that they had potentially infinite lifespans, dependent on maintaining the will to continue living. They are thus known for their personal obsessions (such as collecting, contests of strategy or strength, and various fields of study), each of which is pursued fanatically. While the characters are not truly cosmic entities, all have achieved some cosmic level of power and knowledge related to their particular pursuit. The first encounter with the heroes of Earth occurs when the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] came to Earth seeking to expand his collection.<ref>''The Avengers'' #28 (May 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] created the supervillain team the [[Squadron Sinister]] as pawns to battle the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang the Conqueror]], the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #69–71 (Oct.–Dec. 1969). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although thwarted, the Grandmaster and his fellow Elders take an interest in Earth, and the Collector has two separate encounters with the Avengers, the second ending with his murder by the entity [[Korvac]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #119 (Jan. 1974) and 173–174 (July–Aug. 1978). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Grandmaster also tricks the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] into playing a contest—again involving many of Earth's heroes—that he deliberately loses to resurrect the Collector.<ref>''Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions'' #1–3 (June–Aug. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Grandmaster usurps control of Death's realm, and after a battle between the Avengers and the Grandmaster's champions—the [[Legion of the Unliving]]—is tricked by the Avengers. An angered Death then prevents the Elders from ever entering her realm, which effectively makes them immortal and is the Grandmaster's true goal.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #16 (Dec. 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Elder known as the [[Champion of the Universe]] has a brief encounter with many of Earth's strongest heroes and challenged them to a boxing match. While he did have them use his personal gym to prepare, the Champion of the Universe had to disqualify [[Namor]] when he refused to stoop to training and [[Doc Samson]], whom the Champion declared to not be a worthy opponent. The day of the boxing match came around as the Champion of the Universe faces off against his opponents. After disqualifying [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Hulk]], and [[Wonder Man]] for different reasons and defeating by knockout [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] in hand-to-hand combat, he faces [[Thing (comics)|Benjamin Grimm]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Eventually realizing that the outmatched Grimm would never submit under any circumstances, the Champion concedes the match and offers Grimm his respect.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #7 (Jan. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref>

A group of eleven Elders later join forces and meet on [[Ego the Living Planet]] (who is also regarded as an Elder) in an effort to kill the cosmic entity [[Galactus]], which would cause the concepts [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] to become unbalanced and end the universe. The Elders believe since they are now immortal they would be the only beings to survive and would be supreme beings in the new universe. The plan, however, is thwarted by Galactus' Heralds the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]]. Galactus captures and consumes five of the Elders (Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster and Runner), but three other Elders ([[Astronomer (comics)|Astronomer]], Possessor and Trader) are sucked into a black hole and pass through it into a mystical universe. Two Elders avoid the wrath of Galactus and his hunger, The Contemplater and the Obliterator. Both meet with each other being seemingly the last known surviving Elders and plot their revenge against the universe.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #1–10 (July 1987–Apr. 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Despite this setback, the eight Elders continue their plot against Galactus. While the five Elders within Galactus inflict a fatal case of "cosmic indigestion" upon him, the three Elders in the mystical realm conspire with the cosmic entity the [[In-Betweener]] to restore him in exchange for him returning them to their home reality and his promise to kill Galactus. Using the Silver Surfer, [[Mister Fantastic]], and the [[Invisible Woman]] (whom Galactus had sent in search of the Infinity Gems), the In-Betweener is restored, and he brings the Elders back to their own reality. Once there, the In-Betweener attempts to kill Galactus, but discovers that he cannot do so. When he announces his intention to hurl Galactus into the black hole instead, the three Elders, who wanted to rescue their brother Elders from within Galactus, threaten him with the other five Infinity Gems to stop him. The In-Betweener responds by summoning Death and forcing her to negate them despite her vow. As a result, the Astronomer, the Trader and the Possessor and his Runestaff are apparently disintegrated. The ship carrying Galactus is then thrown into the black hole and passes through to the mystical realm where the In-Betweeners's creators, Master Order and [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]], force the five Elders within Galactus to exit his body, restoring the world-devourer. During the subsequent battle between Galactus and the In-Betweener, the quintet are eventually persuaded to help Galactus defeat his foe.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #15–18 (Sept.–Dec. 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> Moments later, the five Elders use their Infinity Gems to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #19 (Jan. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another Elder, the Contemplator, allies with the space pirate Captain [[Reptyl]] against the Silver Surfer, but is betrayed and apparently killed.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #12 (June 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Contemplator is revealed to have survived—as a disembodied head—and goes on to attempt to rule the [[Kree]] Empire, but is seemingly destroyed by the peace-loving alien [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #20 (Feb. 1989); 25–27 (July–Sep. 1989) and 29–31 (Nov.–Dec. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The five Elders that were previously consumed by Galactus (Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster, and Runner) are targeted by the Titan [[Thanos]] because they possess the [[Infinity Gems]]. Thanos humiliates each in turn (the Gardener is murdered) and captures the Gems.<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1–2 (Sep.–Oct. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Elder the Runner has an encounter with the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] during which the time being Eon describes the Runner as one of "the thousand or so Elders I'm aware of."<ref>''Quasar'' #17 (Dec. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> Quasar also later confronts the Obliterator, the Possessor, and previously unknown Elders the Explorer, the Judicator and the Caregiver. It is also revealed that the Contemplator killed by Reptyl was in fact a [[Skrull]], and not the true Contemplator.<ref>''Quasar'' #47–48 (Jun.–Jul. 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Grandmaster reappears and creates a new version of the Squadron Sinister. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the Wellspring of Power—an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities—the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they battle the superhero team the New Thunderbolts. The Grandmaster is defeated by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]], and the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15–16 (Jan.–Feb. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #102–108 (July 2006–Jan. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Champion has an encounter with the heroine [[She-Hulk]] and aids her foe [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]] by giving her the Power Gem, currently in his possession.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 3 #7–12 (Nov. 2004–Apr. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Astronomer, Champion, Grandmaster, Judicator, and Runner traveled to the planet Godthab Omega, and witnessed the arrival of the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]].<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #3 (Aug. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After [[Battleworld]] is destroyed at the conclusion of "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]," the Elders examine the planet's remains, and find them to be teeming with Power Primordial in the form of an "Iso-Sphere". Their inability to come to a mutually beneficial agreement regarding ownership of the Iso-Sphere prompts the Elders into holding a winner-takes-all Contest of Champions which all but the Grandmaster and Collector are eventually eliminated from.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Al Ewing|penciller = Paco Medina|inker = Juan Vlasco|colorist = David Curiel|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Mark Paniccia and Chris Robinson|story = God Mode|title = Contest of Champions|volume = |issue = #6|date = 24 March 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

During the "No Surrender" arc, it was revealed that one Elder of the Universe originally went by the name of Grandmaster before being defeated by En Dwi-Gast and banished from the Earth-616 reality. Because of the Multiverse being rebuilt, this Elder of the Universe returned where he took the name of [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]] and assembled his version of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] to go up against Grandmaster and his [[Lethal Legion]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #679. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The "[[Empyre]]" storyline introduced an Elder of the Universe called the Profiteer.<ref name="Empyre: Fantastic Four #0">''Empyre: Fantastic Four'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Each Elder of the Universe possesses a fraction of what is referred to as the '''Power Primordial''', remnants of the primordial energies of the [[Big Bang]] that still permeate the universe.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #5 (Nov. 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Power Primordial can be used to produce a wide range of effects, including augmentation of physical attributes (strength, durability, speed), molecular restructuring, creation of force fields, teleportation and numerous other abilities. Some Elders have incorporated this power into their singular obsessions and developed its potential in themselves (i.e. Champion, Runner) while others have to varying degrees mixed that power with tools or resources their obsessions afforded them (i.e. Contemplator, Grandmaster, Obliterator) or even largely ignored it as irrelevant or detrimental to their pursuits (i.e. Gardener, Collector).

Each Elder has developed skills related to their particular field of interest over a lifespan measured in billions of years. In their particular fields of endeavor (i.e. Grandmaster in strategy, Caregiver in medicine), they have essentially unrivaled superhuman levels of talent and expertise.
