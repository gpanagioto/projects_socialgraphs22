 Who is it, Sharon? Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!  Okay, we've had enough!  I don't know. How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.  Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you. I think he's pretty scared alright. Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us. Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself. Oh. You. You don't? Well, you know what I think, Stan? I think he IS from the future. Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get rid of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol. Oh, Stan!  Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself? Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?  Stan... Uh... nothing. Go ahead. Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand ''did'' disappear! He ''is'' you from the future! Uh..  Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too. Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are. Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorists, but... Well son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything. Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.! You really did a nice job, Eric.
