 Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something? Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you've got to let this go. Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on. There was nothing we ''could'' do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there. How? You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.  God damn it. Let's get out of here! Come on! Oh God! I can't watch!  COME ON LET'S GO!  JUST RUN!!  Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do! Let's just go, Let's just go!   You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same. Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.  Indiana Jones! All right!   No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas! No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?!  Indy!  No, stop! Raape! You aren't alone.  We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you. Wh-why? Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him! But they raped Indiana Jones! So, what now?
