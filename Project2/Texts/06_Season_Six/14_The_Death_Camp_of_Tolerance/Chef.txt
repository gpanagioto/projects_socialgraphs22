Hello there, children! How's it goin'? Why bad? ...Intolerant of who? Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better. Children, a lot of times the reason people get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes ''me'' uncomfortable?" Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?! Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that?? You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal. You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!  Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!! He IS a sick queer!! Kiss my black ass!!
