Tom, I'm standing in front of the newly built viral research center where scientists say they have found the animal which started the coronavirus.  The creature was located in China and then flown to the facility here, where scientists are studying it thoroughly. You traced the virus to Wuhan, but what you found was not a bat. Is that correct? And what exactly is pholidota?  and could be running around spreading mustaches right now!
