 The kindergartners! I just came from ''their'' dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's ''real good!'' They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never ''seen'' such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!  The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes! ...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
