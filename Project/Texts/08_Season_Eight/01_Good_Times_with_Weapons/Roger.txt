Come on and take a look, folks. We've got a lot of knives for sale here.   Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission.  Wha- wha- what's the matter?   Can I help you boys? Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds. I thought you told me your parents were dead.
