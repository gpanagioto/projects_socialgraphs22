That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long. Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh.  That was pretty cool.  No? How about this?  Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this?  We're trying to find the brown noiseâ€”it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control. That's a scientific term for crapping your pants. Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II! How about this one, Kenny?  That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.  Stan, what's a queef? Of ''course'' we know what a queef is, you queef! Aaaa-  Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it! I ''told'' you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise." "An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does ''that'' mean? How about geebo, or, or mung? Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.  You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys! The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?  I ''told'' you guys! That they should bring back ''Chicago Hope'' for another season? Totally. Ooooh. They ''should'' bring back another season of ''Chicago Hope'' though, seriously. Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this.  Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys. Uh-oh.  Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
