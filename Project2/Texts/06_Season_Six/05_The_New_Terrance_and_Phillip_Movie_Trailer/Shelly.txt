Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy. The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!  That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time! No, turds! Shut up, fat turd!! We're not watching this!   There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!  All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it! And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds!  I told you I needed tampons, '''tuurrddsss'''!
