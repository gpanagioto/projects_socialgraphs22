Wendy? We need to talk to you, right now.  Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school? Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us?  Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that? Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him. Now, young lady! We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman.
