The first group to be called Femizons were the women of Femizonia, a [[Matrifocal family|gynarchic]] future world in an alternate timeline where women had become [[Amazons|Amazon-like warriors]], ruling over male slaves. It was this world that produced [[Thundra]], a recurring enemy, and later ally, of [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]].<ref>''Savage Tales'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The second group to be called Femizons was a group of all-female [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. They were enemies mainly for [[Captain America]], and their goal was to conquer [[Earth]] and create a utopia where women ruled. Led by [[Superia]], who claimed to be inspired by stories of Thundra's Femizons, the group consisted of a large number of established female criminals and super villainesses. Superia gained Blackbird, Iron Maiden, MODAM, Moonstone, and Nightshade as her lieutenants.<ref>''Captain America'' #386-388. Marvel Comics. The team disbanded due to the vast majority of its members (all but Blackbird, Iron Maiden, and Snapdragon) disapproving of Superia's misandristic and genocidal plans.</ref>
