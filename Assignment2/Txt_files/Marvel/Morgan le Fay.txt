==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Morgan le Fay first appeared in [[Atlas Comics]] in ''Black Knight'' #1 (May 1955), written by [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[Joe Maneely]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=248}}</ref> After the ''Black Knight'' series ended in 1956, she was eventually reintroduced into Marvel Comics in ''Spider-Woman'' #2 (May 1978).

==Fictional character biography==
===Medieval times===
Morgan Le Fay was born in Tintagel Castle, in Cornwall, England, in the days of Camelot, in the Sixth Century A.D. She became a high priestess, and the leader of the Sixth Century cult of the [[Darkhold]], as well as Queen of Gorre (a section of Britain). She and the rest of the cult used the Darkhold to summon its author Chthon. When they found they could not control him, they sealed the dark god away in [[Wundagore]] Mountain.<ref>''The Avengers'' #187. Marvel Comics.</ref> By this time - convinced that Morgan was thoroughly corrupted by evil - her apprentice and lover [[Magnus the Sorcerer]] stole the Darkhold from her.<ref>''The Avengers'' #241. Marvel Comics.</ref> She, along with her lover, [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]], was a nemesis for the original [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]].

During this time, Morgan Le Fay was visited by a supervillain from the future named [[Doctor Doom]] to enlist her in helping wrest his mother [[Cynthia Von Doom]]'s soul from Hell. Le Fay agreed on the condition that Doom become the general of her army, undead warriors of those slain by the sword Excalibur against her half-brother [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur]]. [[Iron Man]] defeated Le Fay causing her to flee to another realm. Doom swore vengeance on Iron Man for this, vowing to see the hero dead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #150. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Conflict with the modern era===
Morgan Le Fay first projected her astral form from her physical body in the Sixth Century A.D. to the present day. She mentally dominated "Slapper" Struthers, transforming him into the superhuman Excaliber, and directed him to retrieve the Darkhold from Magnus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When he failed, she sent her astral form to get the Darkhold from the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], and was defeated by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and Magnus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Impressed by her mettle in battle, Morgan attempted to enlist Spider-Woman into her eternal servitude, but was denied.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Seeking revenge, she began tormenting Spider-Woman with hallucinations, but Magnus came to her aid, and Le Fay's physical body was destroyed in combat with Spider-Woman's astral form. However, she was able to lock out Spider-Woman's astral form from her physical body,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> and attempted to possess it for herself. She was thwarted by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Magnus, [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] in a battle on the astral plane.<ref>''The Avengers'' #240-241. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Morgan then attempted to possess the body of Lisa Russell, but was repulsed by Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #209</ref> Morgan then allied with [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]]. She dispatched [[Dreadknight]], Balor, and other Celtic netherworld monsters against the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and Doctor Strange. She attempted to turn Earth into a dimension ruled by black magic.<ref>''Black Knight'' #2-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Avengers assemble again===
Using the monsters of [[Norse mythology]], she and Mordred lured the [[Scarlet Witch]] (and a team of Avengers) to [[Tintagel]] in Cornwall. There, she kidnapped the Scarlet Witch and used her reality-warping powers to 'bridge the gap' between her elven magic and an [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[doomsday device]] known as the Twilight Sword.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using the Sword, she remade reality: the world was now a [[Middle Ages]] equivalent of itself, except that she ruled the world, and had done so for some time.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the Avengers stepped in and freed the Scarlet Witch, thus negating the original spell the others were based on, and restoring reality.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Doctor Doom]] is revealed to be in a sexual/romantic relationship with Le Fay, traveling back to the past in order to carry on liaisons with her. Le Fay has told Doom to bring her back something "of value" as a gift the next time he comes to her time or not to come back at all. He later returns, asking for her help in creating an army of loyal inhuman warriors. She asks what she gets in return, to which Doom asks her what she wants, to which her response is currently unknown as Doom reappears in the present with his army of [[Mindless Ones]]. Later, Le Fay is seen sadly looking out her window for the return of Doom, who has been defeated and incarcerated by the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dark Reign===
During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Morgan appears in the pages of ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' as the team's first nemesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=11319 |title=Dark Avengers (2009) #3 &#124; Comic Books &#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |access-date=2010-12-28}}</ref> She used a spell to peer into the future and witnessed the formation of the [[Dark Illuminati|Cabal]]. She traveled into the future with an army of demons.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> At first, she attempted to kill Doom when he was a child, but then decided to go ahead several decades, so that Doom could fully know why she was going to kill him, choosing after the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] and engaged Doom in magical combat. As Doom begins to lose, a HAMMER soldier calls Osborn, and the Dark Avengers arrive to rescue Doom. The [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] tears off her head, but she subsequently violently reappeared in his place, and took control over the new [[Mac Gargan|Spider-Man]], who attacked [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is killed again by the new [[Bullseye (comics)|Hawkeye]], but she reappears again. She and her demons are seen fighting the Dark Avengers, while Doom and [[Green Goblin|Iron Patriot]] travel back in time to kill her in her own time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when they arrive, after an unsuccessful magical assault on the two men (due to the considerable amount of iron in their armor suits, the one substance her faerie enchantments cannot affect), she reveals to Osborn her knowledge that Doom plans to betray her and that if they kill her, it will affect Doom's own lifeline, claiming Doom will fall to his nature and betray Osborn; Doom responds by chanting a spell of a language that even she possesses no knowledge to forcibly send the sorceress into her own enchanted cauldron, despite her screams and pleas. Though Morgan lives, she is sent to 1,000,000 BC where she runs from a tribe of [[Caveman|cavemen]] fighting a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Doctor Doom magically restores Latveria and the revived Dark Avengers head back to America.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Avengers World===
After having been freed by her daughter Caroline le Fay from her own magic cauldron that Doom trapped her in, Morgan le Fay took over a City of the Dead underneath Velletri, Italy, a mystical necropolis of which there are many below European cities.<ref>''Avengers World'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> From here she launched a massive attack with armies of the dead all over Europe.<ref>''Avengers World'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Avengers and the Euroforce joined forces to take her down, but they were easily overpowered by the hordes of the dead.<ref>''Avengers World'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sebastian Druid tried to aid the heroes, but he was killed by le Fay shortly after arriving at the city.<ref>''Avengers World'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, killing Druid worked out against Morgan's plans. He became a ghost of the city which, being one of them, allowed his magic to work, pulling back the armies back to their respective necropolises, severely weakening le Fay. The Avengers and the Euroforce proceeded to beat her up, forcing her to retreat.<ref>''Avengers World'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Queen of Otherworld===
Morgan le Fay later resurfaced and planned to conquer Camelot on Otherworld but when the flowers of Krakoa reach Otherworld to form a Gateway to Krakoa, it infected Camelot, causing le Fay to find a way to destroy it. In order to achieve this, she needed to terminate the "Witchbreed", who were responsible for this. After [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]] and his twin sister, [[Betsy Braddock]] came to fix the Gateway, le Fay apprehended them and took control of Brian, making him to turn on his sister. However, he managed to give to Betsy his amulet, which allowed her to escape. <ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan then allied with the Coven Akkaba in order to deal with the Witchbreeds.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Morgan le Fay possesses a natural affinity for magical forces which is a result of her half-faerie genetic structure. She possesses a gifted intellect, and as a former pupil of [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] with centuries of study, she is considered one of the greatest sorceresses in Earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=C.

Due to her faerie heritage she possesses innate personal powers such as the ability to control minds.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Avina |first=Anthony |date=2019-06-20 |title=10 Facts You Didn’t Know About Marvel’s Morgan le Fay |url=https://www.cbr.com/morgan-le-fay-marvel-facts-details/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> She also has the faerie ability to manipulate mystical energy, often through spells and enchantments of ancient Celtic origin, an ability she has honed through practice. She also possesses abilities all humans potentially have, such as the ability to engage in astral projection.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Francisco |first=Mikael Angelo |date=2021-11-15 |title=Marvel's Most Powerful Magic Users |url=https://www.looper.com/661053/marvels-most-powerful-magic-users/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=Looper.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Finally, she has abilities as a high priestess of the Earth goddess (Gaea) by invoking her Celtic name, Danu.

Morgan can mystically manipulate both the natural environment of Earth and the environment of the astral plane in which she once existed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=C. B.

Morgan is also a necromancer and can use her powers to be everywhere at once as an omnipresent being.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Avina |first=Anthony |date=2019-06-20 |title=10 Facts You Didn’t Know About Marvel’s Morgan le Fay |url=https://www.cbr.com/morgan-le-fay-marvel-facts-details/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9</ref><ref>''Avengers World'' #10</ref> She has the power to transmute one thing into another.<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol 2 #1</ref>

Morgan can also tap into and manipulate powerful magical energies for powerful feats of magic without having to tax upon her normal magical abilities, such as when she used the power of the [[Norn Stones]] and the Twilight Sword to restructure reality (although she needed the Scarlet Witch to bridge her Faerie heritage to the Asgardian magic).<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #1-3 (1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan has utilized the ''Crimson Bands of Cyttorak'' to bind Doctor Strange and Balor.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} She is also able to time travel.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Avina |first=Anthony |date=2020-03-16 |title=Marvel Comics: 10 Marvel Comics Villains Who Can Time Travel |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-villains-who-time-travel/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

Morgan is virtually immortal. Her spirit has restored her physical body at the various times it has been destroyed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Avina |first=Anthony |date=2020-02-05 |title=Marvel Comics: 10 Most Powerful Immortal Villains |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-immortal-villains-powerful/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Garcia |first=Mayra |date=2022-03-07 |title=Marvel: The 10 Strongest Female Villains |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-strong-female-villains/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=CBR |language=en-US |quote=Considered one of the greatest sorceresses on Earth, Morgan le Fay often puts other Marvel characters in a predicament because her faerie blood makes her immortal.}}</ref>

In ''The New Avengers'' #53, the Eye of Agamotto appeared to Morgan, as it considered her a possible replacement for Doctor Strange as Sorcerer Supreme.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' referred to Morgan le Fay as one of the "best Doctor Strange vilains," asserting, "Morgan Le Fay ties Doctor Strange to one of Earth's greatest sorcerers of all time: Merlin. Her machinations and schemes have crossed centuries and show the true power of a magician filled with ill will. She has destroyed kingdoms and challenged all of the Avengers. Doctor Strange cannot simply overpower Morgan Le Fay, but must understand her often-obscured goals in order to do the right thing. She challenges him to be a detective as much as a superhero, and reveals another dark mirror for someone as powerful as Doctor Strange."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 8 Best Doctor Strange Villains Ever |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/best-doctor-strange-villains/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref> Gab Hernandez of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' called Morgan le Fay one of the "smartest magic users," writing, "Morgan Le Fay is one of the oldest magic casters in the Marvel Universe and shown to be one of the most successful at fulfilling her plans time and time again. She's incredibly manipulative and often employs underhanded schemes to win against overwhelming odds. For the most part, though, Morgan Le Fay knows how effective a show of force can be. Her centuries of experience have given her an edge in planning over a lot of the other magic users in the Marvel Universe. Having one of the greatest wizards to have ever lived, Merlin, as her mentor has also given her knowledge that even other high-tier sorcerers are unaware of."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Gab |date=2022-03-09 |title=The 10 Smartest Magic Users In Comic Books, Ranked |url=https://screenrant.com/smartest-magic-users-comic-books-ranked/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> CBR Staff of ''[[CBR.com]]'' described Morgan le Fay as one of the "most powerful Sorcerer Supreme candidates," stating, "Having studied under the master magician Merlin, Morgan is widely considered one of the most powerful sorceresses in history. She can create physical manifestations of astral clones, manipulate the Earth, shapeshift, and can absorb mystic energy from magical artifacts. At one point, she absorbed the energy of a Norn Stone to travel through time. In addition to her Celtic heritage magic, Morgan has studied with the Ancient One and can even use Doctor Strange’s signature Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. She’s already been considered and rejected for the role of Sorcerer Supreme before, but there’s no denying that she’s far and away the most experienced sorceress in the Marvel Universe today."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=C.

But Morgan le Fay, an evil sorcerer who has been a magical menace to the Marvel Universe since the days of King Arthur, would undoubtedly shirk the job in favor of her own selfish ends. As powerful as Morgan le Fay is - and make no mistake, she's extremely powerful - she's just as diabolical and driven by her lust for power. It's those qualities that might disqualify her before she even gets a chance to do a poor job, however."<ref name=":3" />

Dais Johnston of ''[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]'' called Morgan le Fay "perfect for an Avengers face-off," asserting, "Marvel has explored all sorts of different genres in its 23-movie history, but we haven't visited the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable — yet. Many people claim Marvel movies are the new mythologies of our age. What better way to prove this theory than to have them face off against a villain from actual mythology, and one with a history deeply entrenched in Marvel's history."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnston |first=Dais |title=Doctor Strange 2 could set up an Avengers 5 villain more epic than Thanos |url=https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/avengers-5-release-date-theory-morgan-le-fay |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=Inverse |language=en}}</ref> Conner Schwerdtfeger of ''[[CinemaBlend]]'' named Morgan le Fay one of the characters "that should definitely debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe following Doctor Strange," stating, "Deriving her name from Arthurian legend, Morgan le Fay is definitely one of the more exotic characters on this list. A half-fairy with the ability to manipulate mystic energy and a seemingly infinite life span, this super villain been alive since the sixth century and has often found herself depicted as a major opponent for the entire Avengers roster.

Now that magic is in the MCU, perhaps it’s time to bring in some classic literary figures from the past. Gosh knows Marvel has enough of them, but Morgan Le Fey, the woman responsible for the downfall of Camelot, has a long and storied history as a Marvel villainess. Le Fay has fought Iron Man many times in her bid to conquer Camelot in the past and present and she has also run afoul of Stephen Strange and is a deadly enemy to all life. Let’s face it, Marvel is modern myth storytelling and mashing up past mythic beings like Morgan Le Fay in the modern MCU would be nothing short of magical."<ref>{{Cite web |last=jbindeck2015 |date=2016-11-11 |title=Doctor Strange 2: Characters We Want to See |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/comics/doctor-strange-2-characters-we-want-to-see/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=Den of Geek |language=en-US}}</ref> Evan Valentine of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' said, "Morgan Le Fay is a sorceress who has regularly been a thorn in the side of the Avengers since her first appearance in Marvel’s ''Black Knight #1'', and many other Marvel characters including Dr. Strange. Morgan in the Marvel Universe is, in fact, the same antagonist who troubled King Arthur and Merlin back in the times of the Roundtable, so she has some years under her belt. Her clashes with Marvel characters have been pretty epic every time she makes an appearance, even going so far as to change everything in the world back to Medieval times, with the Avengers as her own personal army. Her powers are also staggering as she has the ability to warp reality, travel through time, and use a plethora of magical spells at her disposal. Le Fay would make for an interesting villain for Dr. Strange and would certainly be worth introducing to perhaps use her in a future ''Avengers'' onscreen adventure."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Valentine |first=Evan |date=2015-09-21 |title=Doctor Strange Movie: Who Will Rachel McAdams Play? |url=https://collider.com/doctor-strange-movie-rachel-mcadams-character/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=Collider |language=en-US}}</ref>
