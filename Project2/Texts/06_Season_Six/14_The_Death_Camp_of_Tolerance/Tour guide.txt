   Now ''you'' know how it feels.  That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids? That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like "All Asians are good at math" is harmful to society.  Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.  like this young man here. You other boys have probably called this young man names like "tubby," or "lardbutt," or "fat tits,"... But you ''must'' learn to be tolerant of ''his'' differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice. And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies. Well, that's the end of our tour. We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do.  There's no smoking in the museum! Get out of here, you filthy smoker!  Well, have a great day, everybody. Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award.  Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students. It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison.
