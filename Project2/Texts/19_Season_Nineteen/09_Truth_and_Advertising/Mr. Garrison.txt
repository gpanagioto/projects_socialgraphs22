Oh, that, that's where you draw the line, huh Caitlyn? No, you're right, that's nuts! A woman wearing a mustache, that's just ridiculous, huh Cait? No no, please, Cait, don't put on a fake mustache, that's c-razy.  You don't want people thinking you're a weirdo, I mean, Jeez. What the hell is this? What have they done to my town? Since when do we have a flippin' Whole Foods?!  Gay rights? Jeez, you've already got all those. What the hell do you wanna do now?  What the Sam Hell is goin' on!
