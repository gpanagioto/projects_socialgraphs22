I don't play World of Warcraft. Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure. O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then. Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh? I got World of Warcraft, like you said. Well, there's only like four races to choose from-  I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
