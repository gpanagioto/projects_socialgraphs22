I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream? Girls like shaved balls? I think Kenny likes it.  Two hundred dollars? ...Become a Peruvian flute band? But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments?   Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band! Gracias. This is awesome! God damn it! Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second? Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay! We just wanna go home. Look, we're ''from'' Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States. No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru!  You know I can't go there, Stan! That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they? This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru? Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
