You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby. Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers! The baby. The baby!! 
 There you are, Jimmy! 
Hey, it's Gary! How are you? It's so nice to meet you. Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done! Great to meet you! 
Shauna honey, I think your little date is here. 
Clyde? What is it, honey?  
Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome. It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.  A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go? Here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home.  Oh, a-I'm sorry.  People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze. It's okay, Thomas. They understand. 
Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person. And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey. 
Hello?  No, a white shoe salesman tried to murder my son. 
Michael! Michael!  This place gonna fix you, make you normal child!  
Maybe we should turn it off. Call customer service. 
That's enough, Thomas! Oh look at them, Thomas. I think they really like each other. What is it, Thomas? Oh my goodness! Should we go back to Canada then? 
We're so proud of you, Tweek. Awww, hi Craig. Awww. 
Yes, and we're here with our little girl who's dying, just like your friend. Shut up, Theresa! [thinking, "The spice m√©lange. It is here in this house."] This is enough for all the universe!
