 She's... alive. But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone? I don't want you making her upset.  All right.   Right, boys?! Well, I'll let you boys have your say.  Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now! Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now. She's dead.
