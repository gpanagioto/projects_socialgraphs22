 How spicy would you like your Chang sauce? Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on. Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless! ''You're'' a towel! Yeah! Awww. Aw man, I really screwed up this time.

If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.  How spicy would you like your Chang sauce? Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent. Yep! And it's all true. I guess I could edit those chapters down some. Huh? Why not? Wull yeah, but, maybe ''people'' will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives. ''You're'' a towel! Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with ''real'' solutions to my problems.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't. All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.   This is a really good idea.  McTowelie. Steven McTowelie. ...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?  All right! Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person. Really?  Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now. Well Larry, I'm a little high. Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I- ''You're'' a towel. Well you're a ''beaner'' towel. I'm sorry. I'm high. Oh God, I'm ''really'' in trouble now.  Hello? Why? Hey yeah. Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend. All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble. Well, maybe just a ''little'' high.   Yeah. Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah. Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like... Yeah. Yeah, that's it! But I thought you said- Huh? Hoooo! All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time! Hey wait a minute.  Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself.
