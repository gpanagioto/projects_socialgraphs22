Hi, sweetie.  What, hon? Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can. Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it. Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people. Oh.  Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while. Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
