Okay guys, it's November and who can tell me what that means?  Yes, Francis? That's right, the Science Fair is this weekend, and I know you're all very excited to show the projects you've been working on.  All right, what do you guys think of Nathan and Mimallah's project idea?  Jimmy and Timmy, this is incredible! You've somehow made them even smarter.  Boys, this might be the single greatest Special Ed Science Fair project I've ever seen!
