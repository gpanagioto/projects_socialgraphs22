When I look out across this room, I see the backbone of our community. The women of this town need to stand together.  I'm alright. Oh...   Oh, hi Laura. I was! But I had an amazing procedure. I had a fecal transplant. A fecal transplant. It's when they take the feces of a healthy donor and place it in your anus. I feel like a million dollars! I was! But I had a fecal transplant. I'm telling you girls, it's solved every problem I've ever had. I've lost weight, I have more energy, I even think my arthritis is clearing up.  Thanks, Janice. Fecal transplant! Oh it's amazing. You know I could never eat like this before. My allergy to shellfish has literally gone away. ... Um, what? Oh heh, well, you know girls, if the doctor doesn't think it's safe, you probably shouldn't be doing DIY transplants. Yeah.  I mean, i-it's not that I don't want to share everything with my friends, it's just uh, you know, uh, I'm sorry, it's uh, it just doesn't seem right.  Oh, this is Kyle. Sorry, girls, let me take this. [leaves the table] Harriet? You're looking chipper today. I though the doctor wouldn't give you a fecal transplant, Harriet. Where did you get the feces? What? You're joking! Girls, can I just say... you both look fantastic. Well, it's great you guys are doing it the natural way. amd we don't have to deal with Harriet anymore. [the doors fly open and Harriet enters, having thrown up on herself.] Harriet, I do not like your tone. What are you talking about? So you DID take my poo, huh, Harriet?! Oh, IS it? 'Cause the girls told me you called me the C-word the other day. Girls, this was all my fault. I think I got a little carried away bragging about my fecal transplant. Kyle, how did you do it? I mean, how did you even know what was going on?
