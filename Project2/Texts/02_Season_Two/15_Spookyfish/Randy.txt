Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning. Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity. Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. .  Sharon? There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off? What is it? Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick? I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore. Uuuh, do you want your pants back?
