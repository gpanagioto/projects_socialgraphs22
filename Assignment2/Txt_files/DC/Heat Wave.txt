'''Heat Wave''' ('''Mick Rory''') is a supervillain  appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an enemy of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]] and a member of [[Rogues (comics)|The Rogues]] along with [[Captain Cold]].

Actor [[Dominic Purcell]] has portrayed the character in [[The CW]]'s [[Arrowverse]] television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and starred on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' until the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 6)|sixth season]].

== Publication history ==
Heat Wave was first introduced in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #140, written by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=141}}</ref> He was first made to be a rival for [[Captain Cold]]. However, in recent comics by [[Geoff Johns]], Rory looks to Captain Cold to help him keep his obsession at bay, though Cold thinks he'll eventually become beyond help.

== Fictional character biography ==
Born on a farm outside [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], '''Mick Rory''' became fascinated with [[fire]] as a child.  This fascination turned into an obsession and one night, he set his family's home ablaze. His obsession was so great, that he simply watched the flames engulf his house, instead of running to get help.

After this event, Rory went to live with his uncle. His pyromania continued and he was forced to run away after locking a schoolmate in his house and setting it on fire, after the boy locked Rory in a meat locker during a field trip. He took a job as a [[fire eater]] with a traveling [[circus]]. This did not last long either, as he ended up setting the circus on fire. He has an intense fear of cold, called cryophobia. This was due to a school field trip (noted above) to a slaughterhouse, during which one of his friends locked him in a freezer.

It was these events that made him desperate to fight his fire obsession and after seeing the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] in action in Central City, he decided to use his mania to become a villain. He created a protective costume made of [[asbestos]] (this was back before the dangers of asbestos were known), built a gun-sized [[flamethrower]] (nicknamed the "Hot Rod"), and became Heat Wave.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=155}}</ref> As he was committing crimes in Central City, it was inevitable that he would run into the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], which he did quite regularly. Subsequently, he also ended up in jail quite regularly. He also became an adversary of [[Captain Cold]], due to his aversion to cold temperatures. It was Captain Cold who introduced Heat Wave to the Rogues, and in his first appearance they teamed up to get rid of the Flash as they competed over a newscaster they had both fallen in love with and fought each other as they each tried to complete a larger crime spree, but the Flash jailed them both.

Eventually, Mick went straight, due largely to the manipulations of the [[Top (comics)|Top]]. He took a job as a firefighting consultant, using his vast knowledge on fires and heat. He also became good friends with Barry Allen, whose secret identity as Flash was discovered by Rory years before. Rory later succumbed to an offer by [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] of gaining respect and infamy in the world. He and four other members of the Rogues sacrificed themselves, quite unwittingly, to unleash the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]].<ref>''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' #1 (November 1995)</ref>

Neron returned the soulless bodies of the five to Earth, in a plan to force Flash into a deal.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #126 (June 1997)</ref> The five Rogues each possessed incredible powers and wreaked havoc, death, and destruction before Neron was forced by Flash to halt their actions and return their souls to their bodies.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #129 (September 1997)</ref>

Heat Wave would only briefly return to his criminal ways before abandoning them to study with Zhutanian monks.<ref>''New Year's Evil â€“ The Rogues'' #1 (February 1998)</ref> Afterwards, he worked for [[Project Cadmus]] as a backup agent, but eventually quit that too and moved to the [[Quad Cities]], [[Illinois]] area. He eventually got a job at the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], along with other reformed members of the Rogues. This was a spectacular failure and Rory became a villain once again after the Top arrived and undid the mental program that had kept him reformed.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Heat Wave became a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

=== One Year Later ===
In [[One Year Later]], Heat Wave is next seen being recruited by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] to team up against [[Bart Allen]]. He is one of the rogues who deliver the killing blow to Bart. He freaks out about what he and the Rogues have done and flees only to be captured by [[Captain Boomerang]] alongside [[Weather Wizard]]. He is sent to "hell planet" Salvation with the other Rogues. When the conflict starts, he sides with [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]]. When they beat [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn]], he's worried about killing another hero, claiming that they will kill them with rusty razors. He returns to Earth with the villains who are still alive.

=== Salvation Run ===
Heat Wave is one of the exiled villains featured in [[Salvation Run]] along with his fellow Rogues: [[Captain Cold]], [[Weather Wizard]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].

=== Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge ===
He was seen as the member of Rogues who joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #1, however, Heat Wave and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used, particularly after they find that [[Paul Gambi]], the Rogues' tailor, has been badly beaten by the 'New Rogues' organised by Libra. During the hunt for Inertia, Heat Wave also kills Burn- his own counterpart in the 'New Rogues'- when the two shoot their weapons at each other, Heat Wave noting that Burn's costume was of poorer quality than his own, allowing him to burn Burn to death while he is barely sweating while subjected to Burn's own weapons. Captain Cold later has him kill Cold's father, abducted by Libra as a hostage against Cold. While Libra tries to hypnotize the Rogues, Captain Cold tells Rory to watch a nearby fire to retain his focus. When they are fighting Inertia, Rory melts his boots, making him unable to move. He then helps the other Rogues kill Inertia.

Once the crisis is over, the unarmed [[Human Flame]] seeks out Heat Wave, hoping to purchase one of his signature flamethrower guns after his own equipment was lost in a confrontation with the Mafia. After learning that the Human Flame can only offer him $5 000, Heat Wave refuses, denouncing Human Flame as "pathetic". Noting that Captain Cold advised against this meeting and he only agreed to see what the other man had to offer, Heat Wave gives Human Flame a harsh beating, the fight concluding with Heat Wave blowing up the fireworks factory they were meeting in, noting that he had always wanted to do something like that.<ref>''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #2 (June 2009)</ref>

=== The Flash (vol. 3) ===
Heat Wave and the Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words ''In Case of Flash: Break Glass'' written on it.<ref>''Flash Secret Files and Origins'' (2010)</ref> Rory is still on the run with The Rogues.<ref name="theflash1">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010)</ref>

=== The New 52 ===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this timeline, Heat Wave is now able to shoot fire from his chest, and has issues with Captain Cold, blaming him for the breakup of the Rogues. Both villains end up being defeated by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], but upon being incarcerated they meet with Cold's sister [[Golden Glider]] who recruits him for an unknown plot.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #11 (July 2012)</ref>

=== DC Rebirth ===
In the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Heat Wave and his fellow Rogues are among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by [[Riddler]] to talk about the Superman Theory.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==

=== Pre-52 ===
In the Pre-52 continuity Heat Wave had no meta-human abilities; however, he was able to create a [[flamethrower]] that allowed him to project intense streams of flame that reach temperatures well over 900 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. The flame that his weaponry projects is so hot that it has been able to melt Flash's friction proof boots, the same boots that allow Flash to run at light speed. He also has an in-depth knowledge of fire and [[pyrotechnics]].

=== New 52 ===
In the New 52 continuity, Heat Wave merged his [[DNA]] with his flamethrower, thus granting him the ability to project and manipulate fire from his own body.

=== Weapons & Equipment ===
Heat Wave carries a hand held flamethrower that allows him to project a concentrated stream of fire at opponents. He wears an [[asbestos]] suit with a breathing mask that affords him protection against fire and heat. His suit was once shown to be able to project heat as well, capable of staving off an attack from Captain Cold's cold gun, neutralizing solid projectiles, or melting his way through walls. Heat Wave has a pipe attached to his left arm that can project a fire retardant which allows him to put out fires.
