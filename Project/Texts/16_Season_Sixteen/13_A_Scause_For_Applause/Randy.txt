Oh I feel like such an idiot. But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today. All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair! I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now.
