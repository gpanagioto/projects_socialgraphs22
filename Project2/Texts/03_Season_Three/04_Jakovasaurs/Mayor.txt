Ooh, yes. How are you? Right over here.  What? Oh, neato. Hope. Why, that's a ''perfectly'' beautiful name! No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it! Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!  Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy. And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!  We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone. She's a cannon!  Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out! All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do ''some''thing, but we can't just make them leave. But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in? Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there. But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right?  ''Now'' what do we do? You have? You can't leave.  Hello! Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?! We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some ''normalcy'' back to this town! Ready?  Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do ''is lose!''  And, all one of you lucky contestants has to do is answer only ''one'' of these questions! Are you ready, players? Okay. Hands on your buzzers.  You have to wait until I ask the question first. That's okay. Hands on buzzers. Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?!  Now, ''can'' we get on with this? First question: What color is blue?  What? What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to ''lose'', you idiot! Just don't answer any more questions, got it? Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three! What's two plus two, Jakov? Jakov, what is your name?  Oh, screw it. Jakov wins!  You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France! All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!   I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution. Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!
