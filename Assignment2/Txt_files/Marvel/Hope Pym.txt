==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
The character was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] and first appeared in ''[[A-Next]]'' #7 (April 1999).

==Fictional character biography==
After the deaths of their parents, Hope Pym and her twin brother [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] (Henry Pym, Jr.) became outraged when people began referring to A-Next as the "next generation" of Avengers. Using their parents' fortune, the twins put together the supervillain [[Revengers]] team and gained access to the [[Avengers Mansion]] via their parents' security codes.<ref>''A-Next'' #7</ref> When they ambushed A-Next, Hope set about to torture [[Cassandra Lang]], feeling that she's the Avengers' rightful heir. Hope was finally stopped when Henry Jr. prevented her from initiating the mansion's self-destruct sequence, which would have killed both A-Next and the Revengers.<ref name="A-Next 12">''A-Next'' #12</ref>

The Red Queen was later seen using Silikong, a criminal that was mutated with a crystalized human, and his clones to get revenge on the A-Next, but her plans were thwarted by them and [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]].<ref>''American Dream'' #1-5</ref>

Sometime after the [[Spider-Verse]] event, the Red Queen teamed up with Entralla to take control of A-Next using hypnosis and planned to make Cassandra Lang/Stinger execute her own father, [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)#MC2|Scott Lang/Ant-Man]]. Her plans were thwarted by [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] (now known as Spider-Woman), the [[New Warriors#New Warriors (MC2)|New Warriors]] and [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Uncle Ben/Spider-Man of Earth-3145]].<ref>''Spider-Island'' #3-5 (2015)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the Red Queen, Hope Pym uses implanted bio-wings to fly. Also, she has bio-electric blasters installed on the gloves on the back of her hands, and extendable claws built into her gloves. However, she apparently does not have the ability to alter her size.<ref name="A-Next 12" />
