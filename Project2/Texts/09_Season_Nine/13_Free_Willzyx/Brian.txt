Dude, did you see that episode of ''Trading Spouses'' last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell?  What happened? We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all ''our'' fault How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!  we've just gotta make this right ourselves. We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do! Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did? Let's go!   Oh my good, look! We're close. We're really close!  Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool. Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys?  We don't know that!  It WAS funny!! It ''was funny'', Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny! Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son?  Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent! Which highway did they take?? All right, out of the truck! You're carrying a stolen whale! Come on out, kid.  Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this. Aw crap. Mike? Mike?? Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time.  All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!
