 Hey dudes. What are you guys doin'? In your butts? Why would he put anything in your butts?  Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation. Yeah. Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week! It wouldn't work! I don't need to. It wouldn't work. You're on, fat boy! Well, Cartman? Well, go on, smartass, and do it! No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth! Get the fuck out of here! What?   Go fuck yourself, Cartman!  Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass! So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature!   It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a freakin' medal?! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  So?  Cartman, there's something I need to tell you. You were totally, one hundred percent right. You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
