Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo. Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice. What do you say, Shelly? Okay, Stanley. Your turn. What do you say, Stanley? How do you like your fish, Stanley? Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room. Yes, you do! Language! Stanley, settle down! Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo. There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley ''loves'' his goldfish.   Stanley, what are you doing?! Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-   D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are ''you'' doing up?! Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.  Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.  My baby's killed again!  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy.  Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you? Is that so? I'd never seen ''any'' of those men, Officer Barbrady.  Why would you wanna do that? Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!    Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny. Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.  Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking! I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop! Yes, hon?   Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore. I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.  Oh, dear. It really ''was'' Stan's fish that killed those people!
