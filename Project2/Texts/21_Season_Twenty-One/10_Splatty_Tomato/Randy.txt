[rides up on his bike] ...Stranger Things. Stranger Things is the show. I saw it too. You saw It too? Jesus. I don't think anyone's imagining anything. I think the President IS here. You kids get inside somewhere. I have to warn the town! [gets on his bike and rides off, only to fall on his face a few seconds later.] Aw! Oh, for fuck's sake, White, he's running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids! Make her not funny for thirty years? What are you doing, Bob? [Randy is joined by Steven, Linda, Sharon and Roger] Have you been putting food out for the president? We all agreed not to feed him so he'd go away. Bob, come on. You have to know it's not safe to have him here. What's that got to do with anything, Bob? Come on. Bob, if Canada finds out the president is hiding here, they are going to nuke us. He needs to go. Give me the finger sandwiches. What? I'll do it. What the... Principal and Vice Principal...? But... But you two work togeth... You two work togeth... [Vomits] The Principal and the Vice Principal! [He takes off his hood] Sharon... I... I... The... There's... Ugh... You don't want to know. The Principal and Vice Principal are, like... together. [Sharon vomits right onto Randy's face.] Aw! Bob, for the love of Pete, our country is about to go to war! He's not saving Christmas, Bob. He's running around scaring your kids and shitting in the woods. Come on, Bob. What's best for your daughter? I mean, really? I don't know. I guess... It's up to the Whites.
