Come in. Oh yes, Heidi, uh, we just wanted to see if you have transportation to the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend, or if you wanted us to set somethin' up for you. ...Uh, Saturday is the science fair, and, you're the judge for the competition? Well, Heidi, is there a problem with you bein' the judge this weekend? But you're always the judge of the Special Ed Science Fair because you're our best science student. But... Okay, you see, the problem is that you volunteered last month, Heidi. You said you wanted to do it, m'kay? Look, the kids have worked really hard and have done some amazing projects. Heidi, eh... is everything all right? Heidi, you're judging the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend.  She's... kind of like Cartman, but with the ability to follow through.
