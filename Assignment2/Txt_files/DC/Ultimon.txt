The being known as Goraiko is large and superhumanly strong, two versions of the Goraiko construct are known to exist, the 'green version' in Big Science Action and the 'gray version' in the Ultramarines.

He is a member of the [[International Ultramarine Corps]].<ref name="newsarama">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080721-MorrisonFC02.html|title=Grant Morrison on ''Final Crisis'' #2 &#124; Newsarama.com|publisher=newsarama.com|access-date=2015-09-05}}</ref>
