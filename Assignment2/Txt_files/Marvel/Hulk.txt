'''Bruce Banner''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]] originally portrayed by [[Edward Norton]] and subsequently by [[Mark Ruffalo]]—based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Hulk|of the same name]]—known commonly by his [[alter ego]], the '''Hulk'''. Banner is depicted as a [[genius]] [[physicist]] who after a failed experiment to replicate a [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|super soldier]] program using [[gamma radiation]], transforms into a large, muscular creature with green skin whenever his [[heart rate]] goes above 200 beats per minute or when facing mortal danger. As the Hulk, he possesses [[superhuman]] abilities including increased strength and durability. Over time, Banner demonstrates an increasing ability to control the transformation, and he becomes a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. Following the conflict with [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]], Banner is unintentionally transported to [[Sakaar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sakaar]], where he remains the Hulk for a number of years until eventually returning to Earth to participate in the battle against [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]. In the years after Thanos [[The Blip|erases half of all life]], Banner learns to retain the Hulk form with his mind still intact, and he is instrumental in the Avengers' mission to use [[time travel]] to obtain the [[Infinity Stones]] from the past. After the Avengers succeed, Banner himself restores trillions of lives across the universe using the Stones in a specially made [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Nano Gauntlet|gauntlet]].

{{As of|2022}}, Banner has appeared in nine films after being introduced in the titular film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008). The character has been generally well-received by critics and audiences alike, but Norton's recasting and the inconsistent characterization of the character in latter films have some criticism. Ruffalo reprised the role in the television series ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'' (2022).

Ruffalo voices several [[#Alternate versions|alternate versions]] of Banner in the animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]''.

Producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name="NYCC2008Int" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who had played Banner in the 1978 TV series.<ref name="NortonBixby" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton "has a similar physique [and a] similar personality".<ref name="LouCameo" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name="SDCC2007Panel" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name="PennNorton" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling "there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be", as he felt the previous film "strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project.<ref name="NortonTotalFilm" /> During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered [[Lou Ferrigno]] the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name="DarkHorizonsEditBay" /> Originally, the Hulk's only line was "Betty" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word. Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally, and added "leave me alone" and "Hulk smash!" The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended.<ref name="IGNDirectorSpeaks" />

[[Mark Ruffalo]] began his role as Banner / Hulk in ''The Avengers'', after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton.<ref name="NortonReplaced" /><ref name="DeadlineRuffalo" /> Norton has since asserted that it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he "wanted more diversity" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name="NortonTHR">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/edward-norton-talks-avengers-he-743265/|title=Edward Norton Offers New Explanation for Not Playing Hulk in 'Avengers' Films|last=Gajewski|first=Ryan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 23, 2014|access-date=May 30, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023155556/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/edward-norton-talks-avengers-he-743265|archive-date=October 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Screen Rant]]'' has noted that, in part due to the change in actors, "many forget that ''Incredible Hulk'' is even canon within the MCU".<ref name="ScreenRantHulkArc" /> In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to [[Collider (website)|Collider]] that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film.<ref name="April2012NoSequel" /> In a Q&A session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions were underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in ''The Avengers''.<ref name="SequelPossible" /> However, Universal retained the distribution rights for ''The Incredible Hulk'' as well as the [[right of first refusal]] to distribute future Hulk films.<ref name="HulkRights" /> In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the "[[Planet Hulk]]" and "[[World War Hulk]]" storylines, stated, "everything [in terms of stories from the comics] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it".<ref name="Sep2012Sequel" />

In June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be".<ref name="RuffaloSequelJune2014" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a "Planet Hulk" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, "After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see".<ref name="FeigeIGNJuly2014" />

In April 2015, Ruffalo noted that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name="RuffaloApril2015" /> and reiterated this in October 2015,<ref name="RuffaloUSAToday" /> and July 2017.<ref name="RuffaloJuly2017" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name="THRJulyl2015" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name="RuffaloYahooDec2015" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, "We've worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will—when it’s all added up—will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie".<ref name="RuffaloYahooJan2016" />

Charles Pulliam-Moore, writing for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', said of the earlier MCU films that "[w]hile there are a number of storylines from Marvel's comics that delve deeper into the duality of Banner/Hulk's identity... Marvel's movies have forgone those plot lines in favor of trotting Bruce out to babble about science and break things when necessary".<ref name="Gizmodo" /> One specific difference from the comic books is Banner's involvement in the creation of [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron. The Vision, in the films, is created as a counter to Ultron, who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, Hank Pym.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archive-date=January 14, 2018 }}</ref>

Due to the lack of freestanding films about the Hulk, the character has been depicted in very few of the storylines shown in the comic books. In particular, the "[[Planet Hulk]]" storyline from the comic books is highly condensed and worked into ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''; the comic book storyline has the heroes of Earth intentionally sending the Hulk into space due to his excessively dangerous nature,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #88-91 (Dec 2005-Mar 2006)</ref> while the MCU Hulk leaves Earth of his own accord. The merged Banner/Hulk storyline depicted in ''Avengers: Endgame'' also differs from the comics, where a comparable merger was accomplished by hypnosis performed by superhero psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]].<ref name="NewsAramaPg9">{{cite web|title=Duo Dynamics: The Many Incarnations of HULK-BANNER Bond?

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Origin ===
Bruce Banner is a renowned scientist, physicist, and [[medical doctor]] with seven [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]]. While working at Culver University, [[Virginia]], Banner meets with General [[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus Ross]], the father of his colleague and girlfriend [[Betty Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to gamma radiation, a field in which Banner is an expert. The experiment — part of the World War II-era supersoldier program that Ross hopes to recreate — fails, and the exposure to the gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for the first time. The Hulk goes on a rampage, destroying the lab, killing three people and injuring several others. Banner subsequently becomes a fugitive from the [[U.S. military]] and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.

=== Fugitive ===
{{further|The Incredible Hulk (film)}}
Five years later in 2011,{{efn|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years after Banner's first transformation. The events of the film also simultaneously take place with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).}}<!-- See [[Marvel Cinematic Universe#Timeline]] --> Banner works at a soda bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] while searching for a cure for his condition, collaborating on the internet with a colleague he knows only as "Mr. Blue", and to whom he is "Mr. Green". He also learns [[yoga]] techniques to help keep The Hulk under control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an [[Stan Lee|elderly consumer]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Ross tracks down Banner, sending a special forces team led by Russian-born British [[Royal Marine]] [[Abomination (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Emil Blonsky]] to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.

Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, but is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, again transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue, revealed to be cellular biologist Dr. [[Samuel Sterns (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Samuel Sterns]], has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its "limitless potential" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. Banner is caught, and Blonsky has Sterns use Banner's blood to turn him into the Abomination. Blonsky then rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that only the Hulk can stop Blonsky, Banner jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky and flees. Banner soon ends his relationship with Betty, realizing it can no longer work. A month later, in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]], Banner successfully transforms in a controlled manner.

=== Member of the Avengers ===
{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}
In 2012, Banner is working as a doctor in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] when he is approached by [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], who recruits him to help trace the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]] through its gamma radiation emissions. Going with Romanoff, Banner is introduced to [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] and S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]]. He is on the Quinjet when [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] is captured by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and Rogers. After Loki's brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] agrees to place Loki in a cell on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Helicarriers|Helicarrier]], agents including [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] mind-controlled by Loki attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and almost kill Romanoff. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, with Hulk falling to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. In New York City, Banner meets up with Rogers, Stark, Thor, Romanoff, and Barton, becoming a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. After the alien species of the [[Species of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Chitauri|Chitauri]] invade, Banner reveals to Rogers that he is "always angry", immediately transforming into the Hulk and stopping a Leviathan. During the battle, he fights the Chitauri, beats Loki into submission in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Stark Tower]], and saves Stark from crashing into the ground after losing power through the wormhole.

After the Battle of New York, Banner forms a close friendship with Stark and works with him closely, even requesting him to build an anti-Hulk armor to stop him in case he loses control and goes on a rampage. In 2013, Stark shared stories of his [[Iron Man 3|experience with the Extremis formula]] with Banner while they are relaxing in the Tower, seeking advice. Banner falls asleep during it, stating that he was not "that kind of doctor".

In 2015, Banner and the Avengers raid a [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] facility in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sokovia|Sokovia]] and retrieve the scepter. At the Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]" global defense program. After a celebratory party, Ultron becomes sentient and attacks Banner and the Avengers at the Tower, before escaping. In [[Johannesburg]], Banner and the Avengers try to stop Ultron, but are subdued by [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] who uses haunting visions to cause the Hulk to rampage in the city until Stark stops him with his [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Hulkbuster armor|Hulkbuster armor]]. Banner and the Avengers travel to Barton's home to recover, where Romanoff and Banner develop a mutual attraction. While there, Fury arrives and persuades the Avengers to make a plan to stop Ultron, resulting in Romanoff being captured and taken to Sokovia. Back at the Avengers Tower, Banner and the others have a confrontation after they learn about the creation of the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], but after Thor powers him, they learn Vision is an ally. Banner leaves the team to rescue Romanoff and transforms into the Hulk in order to fight Ultron. After the final battle with Ultron in Sokovia, the Hulk departs in a [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Quinjet|Quinjet]] and leaves Earth.

=== Sakaar and Ragnarok ===
{{see|Thor: Ragnarok}}
After Hulk is lost in space, the Quinjet crash lands on the landfill planet [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sakaar|Sakaar]]. He is taken in by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]] of Sakaar, who forces him to fight against other contestants in gladiatorial combat. He rises the ranks, remaining undefeated and winning the admiration of the people of Sakaar, and becoming the Grandmaster's "Champion".

In 2017, Thor crashes on Sakaar, and after being captured by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]], he is forced into combat as well, fighting Hulk in his first matchup. Summoning lightning, Thor gains the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk to help him save [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Asgard|Asgard]] from Ragnarok, and then escapes the palace to find the crashed remains of the Quinjet. Hulk follows Thor to the ship, where a recording of Romanoff makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time in two years. Banner is shocked to learn that he is in space and expresses fear that if he becomes the Hulk again, he will never be able to return to his human form. Banner and Thor ally with Valkyrie and Loki to escape Sakaar to Asgard, where Banner becomes Hulk again to save refugee Asgardians from the giant wolf, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]].

As Asgard is destroyed by [[Surtur (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Surtur]], the Hulk accompanies Thor, Valkyrie, Loki, and the Asgardians on the ''[[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Statesman|Statesman]]'', a Sakaaran vessel bound for Earth.

=== Infinity War ===
{{see|Avengers: Infinity War}}
In 2018, [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] and the [[Children of Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Children of Thanos]] intercept the ''Statesman'' to extract the [[Space Stone]] from the Tesseract. Hulk fights Thanos, but is overpowered. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] uses the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Bifrost|Bifröst Bridge]] to send Hulk straight to Earth, and Hulk crash-lands at the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#New York Sanctum|Sanctum Sanctorum]] of [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in New York City, reverting to Banner. Banner then warns Strange about Thanos, who contacts Stark. When [[Ebony Maw (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ebony Maw]] and [[Cull Obsidian]] arrive in New York in pursuit of the Time Stone, Banner tries to become the Hulk, but is unable to do so. He goes to the Avengers Compound for the first time reuniting with [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]] and later with Rogers, Romanoff, [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], Maximoff, and Vision. He joins the team to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Wakanda|Wakanda]], where he uses Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulkbuster armor]] to battle the [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]] and manages to get the upper hand on Obsidian. He is pleased when Thor, [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] arrive to help. In the forest, he witnesses Thanos's arrival, and is promptly trapped in rocks by Thanos and unable to fight back. After Thanos activates the Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away, Banner is a survivor of [[the Blip]].

Banner, the surviving Avengers, and Rocket return to the Avengers Compound and are shortly met by [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]]. He then witnesses Danvers returning Stark back to Earth and reunites with him, helping him get sedated and rest.

In between 2018 and 2023, Banner undergoes gamma experimentation to balance his two sides in a remote beach house lab located in Mexico built by Stark. By 2023, he is now permanently in the body of the Hulk but with the mind and voice of Banner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/avengers-endgame-hulk-banner-comics/|title=What's Up with Banner and Hulk in Avengers: Endgame?|first1=Rosie|last1=Knight|work=[[Nerdist]]|date=April 25, 2019|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> He meets Rogers, Romanoff, and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] at a diner and agrees to help them with their quantum time-travel plan. At the Avengers Compound, they try to time-travel Lang using [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]]'s quantum tunnel but are unsuccessful. After Stark arrives and offers his help, Banner and Rocket travel to [[Norway]] to the colony New Asgard, and recruit a depressed drunken Thor to return to help the Avengers. Back at the Compound, the Avengers formulate a plan to time-travel and retrieve alternate Infinity Stones. Banner, Rogers, Stark, and Lang time-travel via the [[Quantum Realm]] to an alternate 2012 in New York City. There Banner gets the Time Stone from an alternate version of the [[Ancient One (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ancient One]] (to whom he promises to return the Stones to their respective periods in time when the Avengers are done with their mission).

Banner then returns to the present, but is devastated to learn of Romanoff's death, who had to sacrifice herself to retrieve the Soul Stone. After mourning her with the original Avengers, Banner, Stark, and Rocket combine the stones with the Stark Gauntlet. Banner then volunteers to activate the Infinity Stones, citing his general strength and his specific resistance to gamma radiation. He does so and reverses [[the Blip]], though his right arm gets permanently injured in the process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/joe-russo-confirms-hulk-arm-injury/ |title=Avengers Co-Director Confirms Hulk's Post-Endgame Status |date=May 6, 2019 |website=Comic Book Resources |access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref> After doing so, an alternate version of Thanos emerges from the quantum realm and attacks the Compound, causing Banner, Rocket, and Rhodes to be trapped in rubble, until they are saved by Lang. He then takes part in the final battle against Thanos and his army, who are eventually defeated when Stark uses the Infinity Stones, at the cost of his own life. After the battle, Banner attends Stark's funeral, and then prepares a new quantum portal so that Rogers can return the alternate Infinity Stones and Mjolnir. He, [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], and Sam Wilson witness an elderly Rogers return and give his shield to Wilson.

==== Meeting Shang-Chi ====

==== Training Jennifer Walters ====

{{Further|A Normal Amount of Rage|Superhuman Law}}
Banner and his cousin, lawyer [[Jennifer Walters (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jennifer Walters]], go on a road trip but are intercepted by a Sakaaran eight-courier craft ship, causing Walters to crash the car. Banner bleeds, and his blood is accidentally cross-contamined with Walters', resulting in Walters transforming into a Hulk and running away; Banner eventually retrieves her and uses the lethal gamma dose she took to completely heal his arm. In Mexico, Banner trains Walters on controlling her Hulk form, however she rejects the idea of being a superhero and wants to return to her legal career. The pair get into a fight and Banner eventually accepts Walters wanting to leave and bids her farewell. A few months later, Banner takes off in the Sakaaran spaceship to investigate the message from the car crash; while there, he receives a call from Walters and encourages her to take on the case of representing Emil Blonsky, as they have made amends. Banner also indicates approval of Walters' new superhero name "She-Hulk", given to her by the media, saying that "She-Hulk, attorney-at-law" has a nice ring to it.

The three are surrounded by Ross's troops, and Banner transforms into the Hulk after being hit by a bullet.

He stated that on contrary Ruffalo's Hulk had "both dynamic action sequences and crowd pleasing moments of humor and dialogue". In order to achieve this, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] created a new motion capture and facial animation system. Hulk's face was generated from a life cast / scan of Ruffalo's face, which was then manipulated in the program ZBrush to become the Hulk, while making sure to retain Ruffalo's essence.<ref name="fxguide" /> Ruffalo reprised the role in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013),<ref>{{cite web |date=May 12, 2013 |title=IAR Exclusive: Mark Ruffalo Talks Marvel Cameos and the Future of The Hulk |url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/movie-news/item/8867-iar-exclusive-mark-ruffalo-talks-the-future-of-the-hulk.html |publisher=IAmRogue|access-date=May 13, 2013 |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611040510/http://www.iamrogue.com/news/movie-news/item/8867-iar-exclusive-mark-ruffalo-talks-the-future-of-the-hulk.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015),<ref>{{cite tweet|date=March 6, 2013 |first=Mark |last=Ruffalo |author-link=Mark Ruffalo |title=A lot of folks have been asking about the Next Hulk.

===Other media===
Ruffalo reprised his role as Bruce Banner in the non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]] short film ''[[Team Thor (film)|Team Thor]]'' (2016).

== Characterization ==
For ''The Incredible Hulk'', Louis Leterrier stated that Edward Norton's rewrite of the script "has given Bruce's story real gravitas", explaining that "just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]]".<ref name="April2008Empire" /> In taking up the character for ''The Avengers'', Mark Ruffalo said, "He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself—the dark and the light—and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities".<ref name="EW1" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, "He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!"<ref name="Kimmel" />

By ''Age of Ultron'', Ruffalo stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was "a bit more complex",<ref name="Ruffalo2" /> with a confrontation brewing between Banner and the Hulk: "There's a very cool thing happening: Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk.. and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other."<ref name="Ruffalo3" /> While filming in [[London]], Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulk's lines.<ref name="IGNHulkOct2014" /> Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulk's dialogue spontaneously, saying, "What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that you're pretending he's a werewolf when he's a superhero. You want it vice versa... So the question is, how has he progressed? How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does? And that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment."<ref name="WhedonDec2014" /> When the character next appears in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', two years have passed since ''Age of Ultron'', and Hulk has become a successful and popular gladiator on Sakaar,<ref name="EWMar2017Plot" /><ref name="RuffaloTR" /> having suppressed the Banner side in those years. He is forming the vocabulary "of a toddler",<ref name="EWSDCC2017" /> with the level of Hulk's speech being "a big conversation" between director Taika Waititi and Marvel since it was taking into account future appearances for the character:<ref name="WaititiHulk" /> ''Ragnarok'' begins an arc for the character that continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name="RuffaloHulkArc" /> Ruffalo felt Hulk had "a swagger" in the film, and was "much more of a character than the green rage machine" seen in the first two ''Avengers'' films.<ref name="EWMar2017Plot" />

The Hulk only appears briefly at the beginning of ''Infinity War'', with Bruce Banner spending the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers, and to "impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is".<ref name="ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018" /> Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that "Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass." Russo added that this was "really reflective of the journey from ''Ragnarok''... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control."<ref name="RussoHulkScared" /> The difference between Hulk and Banner is intended to be shown as "starting to blur a little bit". Ruffalo described Hulk in ''Infinity War'' as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.<ref name="ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018" /> Despite the lack of further standalone films, "Bruce and the Hulk have managed to eke out a character arc in the six years since ''The Avengers''", with ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Infinity War'' highlighting an ongoing battle for control of which persona will manifest, expected to be resolved in ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name="ScreenRantHulkArc" /> In ''Avengers: Endgame'', the Bruce Banner and the Hulk personalities are shown to have reconciled and merged into Professor Hulk, who has the strength of the Hulk but the intelligence of Bruce Banner.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/27/avengers-endgame-hulk/|title= Avengers: Endgame explained: The Hulk's closing scene |magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 27, 2019|access-date=May 1, 2019|first=Anthony|last=Breznican}}</ref><ref name="Gizmodo">{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/professor-hulk-is-avengers-endgames-gift-to-bruce-bann-1834481486|title=Professor Hulk Is Avengers: Endgame's Gift to Bruce Banner|first=Charles|last=Pulliam-Moore|website=Gizmodo|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=May 30, 2022}}</ref>

=== Appearance and special effects ===
In filming ''The Incredible Hulk'', Leterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard for which he was aiming.<ref name="Keown" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's "thunder claps").<ref name="ProdNotes" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name="LATimesShade" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name="IGNRoth" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name="DVDBecomingHulk" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effect company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name="VancouverSun" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary "finesse [and] superhero quality".<ref name="SFXfinesse" />

[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name="Keown" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had "too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off". He explained, "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank."<ref name="Keown" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name="ProdNotes" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name="LATimesShade" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name="SFXfinesse" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name="SFXfinesse" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name="DVDBecomingHulk" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name="AICNEditingBay" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name="MTVEyes" />

''The Avengers'' was the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, "I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun".<ref name="NYMag" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name="CastRuffalo1" /> To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name="fxguide" /> ILM returned to create the digital Hulk. [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, "We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue."<ref name="AWN" />

For ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ILM had to add much more detail to the character's facial features, due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM "built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics."<ref name="FXGuidePart2" /> To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.<ref name="ColliderSep2017Trivia" /> Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stunt men would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from ''The Dark World'', resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.<ref name="FXGuidePart2" /> Taika Waititi also provided additional motion capture for the Hulk after Ruffalo had completed his scenes.<ref name="WaititiColliderSep2017" />

With respect to Bruce Banner's regular appearance, his fashion sense has been critiqued with the observation that "in just about every appearance, he's wearing a nondescript suit with a purple button down shirt".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=Vulture|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> By contrast, Banner's "Professor Hulk" appearance in ''Avengers: Endgame'', including his penchant for knit sweaters, has been described as "hot" and "sexy".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Hulk-Hot-Avengers-Endgame-46078093|title=Uh, So, There Are a Lot of People Who Think the Hulk Is Hot Now After Seeing Avengers: Endgame|first=Quinn|last=Keaney|date=May 2, 2019 |access-date=May 30, 2022}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Norton's performance as Banner received a generally positive reception. Reviewing ''The Incredible Hulk'', Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way—except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks".<ref name="RahnerReview" /> Conversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that "the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict".<ref name="LemireReview" />

Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk in ''The Avengers'' was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano."<ref name="nydaily2012" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey.<ref name="newyorker2012" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself."<ref name="villagevoice" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a "scruffy warmth and humor" vibe,<ref name="rollz" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name="LATimes2" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses)".<ref name="EW-review" />
