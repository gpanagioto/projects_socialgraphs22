Eh- Excuse me? Yeah. Free Hat. Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place.  Can't we also work towards freeing Hat? Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free! Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha. He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat. But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison?  No? ''There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. [the governor looks up a bit surprised]'' Sure. Give that man a baby!
