And now, Larry King, live. On this episode of Real Actual Whale Wars, Captain Marsh searches for the Japanese fleet, knowing they could be absolutely anywhere.   Captain Marsh races his boat to the last known location of the Japanese whalers. If he doesn't get there in time, hundreds of dolphins or whales could die. On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show. But everywhere his reality show's boat turns, the crab fishing reality boat blocks its path.  It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging.  Captain Marsh's boat is dead in the water. He can't go after the Japanese, he can't help the whales or dolphins. Once again on Whale Wars, nothing is happening. The crab-fishing reality show is doing just fine.  But for the Whale Wars crew, it appears the show is over. Until... a sound is heard.
