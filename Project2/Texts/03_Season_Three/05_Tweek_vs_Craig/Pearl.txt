Richard, aren't you going to invite me in? Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-''tempt'' to make love to me tonight. Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why? We'll use plastic wrap.  Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats.  Okay, that was ''very'' good, class. Now let's try this one together.  Honey, can I get a new wardrobe? All right, now let's try ''this'' one together.  Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car.... Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one.  I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life. Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try?  I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed.  O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick? Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you. Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good. No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class. Now, now. Very few students are ''severely'' injured in a shop class. Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you ''any''thing?
