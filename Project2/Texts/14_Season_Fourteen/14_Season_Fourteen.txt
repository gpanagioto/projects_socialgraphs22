Put it down, you bitch! Put the golf club down, you crazy bitch!  Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone. ...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.  Eric Cartman? My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil. It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.   Everything all right, Fred? Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go? You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow! God, shut up!  Will you just listen to me?!  You fucking whore! I'm getting the fuck away from you!  D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt! Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch! Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it!  I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise- Oh no! Agh! Stop it! I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys.  So I officially announce my return to golf. Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?! Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!! Listen to this-a!  Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?! Open the door, you motherfucker!  It serves you right, you cheating turd!   How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!  You motherfucker! I should have never married  A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?!   Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox.  Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash!  Oh dude, was that a combo move? Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie. Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time. I told you this game was sweet, dude. Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that? Oh, you're going down, Elin! Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up? Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone?? What the hell?! This game's all boring now! Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!  Aww, books? God, I hate those! Oh really? Sweet. Oho man, I can't wait! No on, come on, let's read it now! Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies?! Can we please read this right now?! Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!" They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity!  We know, we were just saying that. It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene! Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one. The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass. It was a... a warm spring morning.  Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny! ...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all. And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down! Butters, what are you up to? Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it. Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night! That's right. Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?! Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit! That inconsiderate jerk! There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact! There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly! All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker. Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned. Shhh.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed. Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.  See any hunters yet? Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there. So what? Oh dude, sweet!  People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter! What?! Oh come on! Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters. That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.  You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter. Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you.   Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.   Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips! Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uhm sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole, Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are! Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?! They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park! This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP! Mom, drive faster! Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG! WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit! Fuck you! No! No, what's going on?!  No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too! You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?! Nooooooooo-!    Really? Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?! Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!  Oh God, oh God it's so good. Yeah. Who isn't? Billy Miller? Seriously?? Tommy said you have some KFC. Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Where did you get that?! 85 bucks?? I don't have that!  How much KFC are we talking? Holy fuck, dude. Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime? Are you Teabag? Cut the crap. You got the stuff? Extra crispy?  You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy! IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT!  You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!  Like anybody wants KFC without gravy! Nothin', it's cool. Yeah I got the stuff.  Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here.  Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel? Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles? I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want. Who? You mean Tommy?  Wait, where'd he go? Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked. Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you! Good.  Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!  Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand! ...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer. I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test. Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys? Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good. Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker! What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker. Colonel, how are you doing?  We had a little problem.  Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that? Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time. Hey, take it easy Colonel.  I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle! 'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.  Stupid Facebook stuff. Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you. Surprise!  Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy. Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle! You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him. Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip. It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette? Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette. Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect. Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello? Okay let's, let's try this one. Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going? This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends. Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy... Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first! Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off... Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there. Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too. Wow, coo'...  Chocolate rules! AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew! I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad. Hey, that is Tom Cruise!  Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right? I didn't come for myself. I'm just an escort for another celebrity who wants to get in on your lawsuit... Wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money? Uh, excuse us for a second...  Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing? Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money! If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner. You're a no-good swindler and a too-good thief. We were here for money, not goo! Yeah, so what? So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves. No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez. You just had seven tacos. I'm sorry.  Why are you doing this?  Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore! No, I tried getting one last week! God, will somebody shut her up? I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time.  Let me by... Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner. My father... I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father. How could you know anything about who my family is? If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, then you'd better- Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father? I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat. I said GET. Mr. Hat! Put it on!  Do the voice. Keep... your hand... UP! By who? Goddammit, Garrison, who is my father? That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!  Ahaaa! Nice work, Conner. Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door! Them who?! Then start explaining it to me! No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is! It's all that matters! I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is! Who you calling stupid, Jew? Gingers? No! Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I? Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth? Hello? I'm here, whoever you are.  Daddy?  Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be. Scott Tenorman. Eeewww. What do you know?! Mom? Protect who?? My dad was a Denver Bronco? No- nooo. No! Noooo! Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means? My dad was a ginger! I mean, obviously, I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me! What? Cheer up? I'm half ginger! Hey, you're right. That ''does'' make me pretty cool. Really, Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go? Take it easy, Conner.   Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-. I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today? If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom.   Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay? It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us. I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?!  Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!   No I can't; I'll always be like this.  Come on you guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes!  I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be! Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny! You love NASCAR huh? You see I told you guys!   Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.  Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Butters. Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched! But  psyched up?? Get really psyched up, Butters! I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold! I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can. Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money? I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of ''Two and a Half Men''. Not yet. Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?! Fucking gross!  we need Vagisil! "Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes." Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters. I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget? Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Is anybody coming? Mm, 'kay, Mm.  Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid! Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now. Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!   Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR. Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters. What's that? Oh okay.  Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet!   All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.  Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself. I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough. Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this. Aw donkey balls... Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better. Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough? Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again.  Oh hey, Kenny!  Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.   Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do! Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth! I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit. Yeah? ...Uh oh. Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits! Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR! Aww coool, huh Kenny?   Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left. Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes. Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes! Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?! Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us. Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  He's fuckin' gay as hell!  So y'all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell! Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?  NASCAR! Yee-ah! Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake!   Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey! Oh yeah, I see it.   You see that? Daynicuh Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off! Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang! ''"[Cartman made it back on the track]"'' I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!  Get off my car, Kenny! We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!  Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car. Fuckin' gay as hell.    No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it.  I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.  The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back! Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over! You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep. Oops, busted.  Aw, crap, there's more of them? You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!  Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him. Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey! So what?! That makes ''you'' from Jersey!  Let's just get away from him. Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three! You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!  Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to ''look'' like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange! Yes, it is. It's getting oranger. Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a ''lot'' more! What the hell are you guys doing?!  And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy! Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?! Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!  Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?! So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open. I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now! This is ''very'' serious, Butters. Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up. Come on, you guys, hurry! I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out. Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle! Nuh-uh. Seriously, nuh-uh. Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!   Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. ''[rushes up to the freezer door] ''Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted. Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?! You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!  Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me? What does it want?! No! You guys, it's raping me! ''It's raping me!''  Thank you, Kyle. Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster. So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth.   Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk.", you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude. I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives? I need to speak with him, please. I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir. Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends. I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.  ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away. Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!   Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them. Asshoooles!   Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!  Oy! Bebebebebebebe. Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!  What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?! Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit! What are you guys doing? Aw dude, I clocked you! Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron.  Hit A and X together. I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up. Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense. Yeah, where's all the fighting? Yeah, golf is stupid again.  All right! Did you get to any dirty parts yet?  I don't get it dude. W-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times. Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous? Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book.   Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer! My parents must have found it! Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me! Well dude, somebody has got to go down! Butters, listen: you are in big trouble! Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters.  Hey, wait a minute, that's ours! What? Hey!  Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole!  God-damnit! More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity! Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again! What? Dude, that is not in the book at all! What? There's nothing about liberals or conservatives! I can't believe they won't ban our book! Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one.  So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!  You can't be serious! You people like this?! God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!! They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money! Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television. Hey, it looks different. A what? What'd they say? The doctor? But, Dad, we wanna eat.  Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.  Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again? Why are you guys in here wasting your time?

Okay I'll be your friend. Awww! Why oh oh? Yahtzee? Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?  I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here! My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?! Oh yeah? I can try!  You're an asshole, Kyle! What's the one thing I told you?!

I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else. Fuck off, Dad.  Oh God, you guys, really? This again?  You guys, stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff!  Huh?  Oh, wow it is! Hey, guys, check it out. Tom Cruise is a fudge packer! Then why are you packing fudge? Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge. For what? But, dude- I have no idea... Aww... he was packing fudge! It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar- Ooooooo... I saw him once.  Yeah, a while ago, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends. No, dude, it was totally fine. Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln... Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour. Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ! Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything. Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there! What? No, Dad, we promised that Muhammad would stay in the truck. No, you can't even show his feet. Muhammad, are you okay?  They want his power? Yeah, we said we'd take care of him. We made a promise... to Jesus!  Dude, we can't do that It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here! Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad. When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul! If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?! Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad! Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad. The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.  ...Yeah. Dr. Mephesto, we need your help! Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now! Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad. Come on, guys, we're running out of time!  That's not cool! We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president! Oh crap, the gingers! What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?! Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back.   Yeah. Oh, dude, look.  Hey, Cartman... Yeah, dude, we, we know what it means. Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that you had Seaman on your back. We do? Oh, oh, yeah, we do! We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there. Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left! There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined!   Stupid towel!  A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.  Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.  Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go? Cartman, dude, what's wrong? Why not?  Cartman, tell us. Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can. Dude, noo, you- you don't know that. Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR! Dude, you are so retarded! You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other! They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing." Did you know your mom was from Jersey? No, uh, it just explains a lot. Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is. Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.  Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler? Dude, what are you doing?  We gotta find a way past it! Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?  ..Dude. Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal. I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage? A note?  We need to talk.  My locker? Are you serious? Well, it's just a little messy. Aw, come on. Yeah, alright. What, come on, it's not that bad. My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away. Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box. Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I- Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I- Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that. Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like- Well, I- I guess so, but-  Well no, don't throw that out.  I don't... I don't know. Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding." Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?  Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?  Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like- What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here? What the hell's going on?! Mr. Mackey. Mr. Mackey, what are you doing? Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up! Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me. I'm working on it!  Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip? Oh-Ohhhhhhh. Wait wait, where the hell are we now? Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy! Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey. Dad? Is that you? Where are you? The hell are you doing, dad? Did you come here to help me? Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality! DAD!  Aaaaaagh! Who's that? What the fuck? Mr. Mackey, stop running! Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time. Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding. Shut up! You can do it Mr. Mackey. What the hell? Who are you people? Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own? ...So then why aren't we waking up? Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!  I think I have a better idea. Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with. Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy! Who's Captain Hindsight? Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.  Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room? Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys. It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf!  Dad, what are you doing? Aw crap.  Can I have a Pop Tart? Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels. You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it! Awww what?! No, dad! No! Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?! Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now! Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef. Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom! Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me! Dad, what are you doing? Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef! No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back! He's not going to listen to us! We already tried! That's stupid, Cartman. You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded. ...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you. Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up. Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream!  Hey no, no. All you people get out of here. (Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)  (Woo hoo!) (Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)  (Who fuckin' cares?) (Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?) (Really??) (Awesome, dude!) (Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?) (Awesome.) (No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs) (It's fucking disgusting!)  (Okay.) (Not yet)  (Huh?) (Sixty two.) (Yeah!) (I am. He's right here.)  (What?)  (What?)  (Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)  (Yeah! How cool!) (Woohoo!) (Woohoo!) (Yeah! Yeeaahh!)  (No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!) (Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)  (Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!) (Dude, fuck you!) (Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)  (NO, YOU FUCKING DON'T!!)  (WHAT?!)  (No fucking way!)   (Aww, come on!) (Aw come on, fuck you!)   (Stop this car!)  (Stop this car right now!)  (I fucking hate you!) (AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...)  (HA! You fucking lose!)  (Yeah.)  (Yeah, it's really good.) Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool. Jesus, dude. I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny? What?! Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure? So what happens to us now? Oh God, it's true.  Butters! Butters, stop it!  Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny! No! Butters, stop!  Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us! Hello? Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet. Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions.  Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease.  Okay so, what exactly are we doing now? ...As soon as what's dead?  I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything. What? What bastard?  Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book? No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is. I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. [the door opens and a pissed-off Cartman enters and closes the door]  Why the hell was this book banned?! Dude, some people really do consider this obscene. Yeah, sweet!  Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one... Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down! What?  Yeah, we wrote that! No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters. Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book! Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the- The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny! Yes! I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye! What?!  Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker!  Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this! Butters wrote a second book! We can get people to believe us now! A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery! Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning. Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards! So where's the KFC now? ...So no KFC? How the hell do you have more friends than me? How many friends do you have, Kenny? What? How the hell do I only have thirty-seven friends? Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it. Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page.  Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us! Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend. There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong. I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Can I come in? I... don't... have... any... friends... I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now. 'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops? Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!  You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehease! 'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up... Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan! I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you. I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad. I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet. No. What's chatroulette? Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.  That's just a guy's penis too!  Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises! Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore! That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends? Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too! Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!   ...What?  Dude, w-what are you doing? Profile status? Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late. Dude! Dude okay! S-Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends. Café World. An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there! Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's. What? Why? Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him. Unh, that does it! I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy.  You should know, fatass. Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him. Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything. Dude, what did you do?  Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again. Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate? K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag? Aww, come on! This is ridiculous!  A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight? There doesn't have to be... But Muhammad can't be seen, Dad. What kind of extremists are these?  We can't give him over to the gingers! Aw crap. Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.  Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it! Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig? I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on!  Come on, Muhammad, the door is open. Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand. Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications! Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now! Oh, you are not doing ''that'' again! Stop talking with your stupid hand! Dude! We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist! Oh, yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back. That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only ''true'' power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works. Look, man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear. Wwait, what? Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?! You gotta be kidding me! Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up. If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.  When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything. Please, sir.  Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men. If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself. We're here for Towelie, fatass! This is serious, you fucking asshole! But he's just using his time on television to rant about- Oh my God! Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Something's going on. "What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"? Aww. Cartman, you can change things about yourself.  What?! Cartman, you ''are'' poor and you ''are'' stupid! How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything! I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot! Mom, Dad, what's "muff cabbage"?  The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage". She said they're from New Jersey. Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight. Know what, Ma?  Is ''that'' why there's crap on my doorstep every morning? Where the hell are they coming from?!   Hey, dudes. What are you talking about? So what? No, it doesn't! I'm not from Jersey. I was born here. What's strike three?! Shut the fuck up!  What? Why does it matter?! No, it isn't! No.  Oh my God! Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now.  Not now, Mom. Please. All right, all right.   What am I, Mom?  What are you saying?!  No! I don't wanna look like this! I can hide it!  I can't ever let anybody know! I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do! That's enough!   Why? You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them. I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me! All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you? No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you? Oh, God.  Get out of here! Agggh! Agggh!   Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else! You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel. It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing. What's it say?  Dude. What's wrong with you? Maybe you should go talk to the counselor. But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with. How do you know...  Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode. We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right? He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay. He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good. Let's hear it, Cartman! Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots? I've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer. As you've all seen on the news, our country is facing a major crisis, and we need to find out what's causing it.  Why? Why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women?  I want answers!  Sex awhowho? Yes, we all know that, go on. What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction? That does it!  I want health screening at all our nation's schools! We need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease. Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton? We're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country. Young people all over America are infected, and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them.  They're leading lives of secret pain. It appears so. We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities.  However, we are still collecting data, and all-  -answers which we all desire.  My God... Incredible. And, and what's it doing now? Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop. No good, Mr. President. Because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to ''make'' money and ''become'' successful in order to feed their addiction. Yes. That's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues! We tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now. Then we looked at the backside, and found this.  Independence Hall. We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men. And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?! Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this. Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true? A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!  The hell was that? It's the alien wizard! It's gonna get you boys! Shoot it!  Shoot it again, it's still alive!  My God, they've done it!  Tiger Woods was only the most prevalent, but our data shows that the numbers are growing. David Letterman and before that, Bill Clinton. There's a pattern here, people. We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!  Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo. You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare! It is! We don't have time for this! Then we go into your husband's dreams! It's so complex and cool. No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up. He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo!    Empty scary dreamspace. I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream! We got 'em! The bad memories are dead. Right.  Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.  Oh, whoops. Dream conundrum. This is bad.   We believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction, sir.  No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!  But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her. To better understand the sex addiction outbreak, we've been running tests on chimpanzees.  Yes...  The subject is now isolated and shunned. Making a public apology on its talk show.  We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility. Keep firing, boys! Shoot it in the heart!  Arrgh. Definitely true.  You have to shoot it!   It could be caused by something in the water supply. Uh, perhaps even by - global warming. If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children  Or cooling. Yes Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms.  Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided. Okay, very good.  Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand? Very good, turn your answers over please.  Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow?  I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction. We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid. Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.  A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation. I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome. Oh! Wow. Ohhh. Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.  I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??  Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that?? Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button! Oh no! It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that? Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume. There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..  But this is what I keep seeing in my head!  No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine. Haah! Leave me alone!  Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush. I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries? Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore. Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips. Kill John Lennon...  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?  Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians. Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding. I am? Oh no. Which book was that? I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read ''The Catcher In The Rye'' I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep! Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did. Huh?  Oh, thanks. I wrote that.  Thank you!  That's nice.  Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric? But, you told me I did! Yeah, I'm broooding. No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading ''The Catcher in the Rye'', I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener! I have to come right to my room after school. Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly. Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so. Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan. Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit. Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind! Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver! Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation.  I know.  You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And now she's gone and it's because of me! Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get through this. What? What?! Oh no! Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly.  Hey, Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise? How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?  Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.  Towelie! Open the door! Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important! Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.  Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways. You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?  Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you! He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please.  You will? Hey Eric. Ahhh well oh- kay. Eeyeah, I'm psyched.  I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah. NASCA- NASCAR? You're givin' away all your money?? You sure you want to do this?  Hey Eric. Yep. You don't have a penny left.  How come you're hangin' upside down? Feel stupid yet? All those ladies have stinky vaginas? Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings. Wuh- uh I'm buyin'? But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil. No, you're good.  Really? That was fast. Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped. Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.  Eric, are you sure you can do this? I think you gotta press the gas pedal. There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.  Eric? Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be. Eric! Don't ever talk like that! How bad is it, doctor? Well at least there's that. Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid. It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going? You seemed really stupid, Eric. Obama's fuckin' gay. Pissin' me off! Yeah, he's a champion alright. Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side. That's fuckin' gay as hell. There you go. You're back on the track. Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell?  I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.  Huh? Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know. Kyle did that? Gee whiz. Are you being serious? Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die. Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh! Hey, Stan, I have a note for you. Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.   In fourth graders, five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts. By sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent. At high schools, nearly ninety-one percent of male students answered, "What handkerchief?" Oh my God there it is! And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people? The poor bastards! So uh what's your guys' take on the track here? Any concerns?  But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure? Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake fade problems? The dark god Cthulhu continues his rampage of destruction and terror, and there seems to be no hope for man. I'm joined now by a supposed team member of Cthulhu, the Coon. Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred. Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?  Read what? So? Huh? "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross! "He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this-  Noo, noo, that's just WRONG! "Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"  "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man. It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's the best book I've ever read. No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow! NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff. Butters? Is that true? Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.  Hey, uh, what's up with the KFC? Alright, boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on.  Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC? Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!  My huh? Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back!   KFC's gone, been replaced. Yeah, well, I gotta get to the doctor.  I gotta get to the doctor!  All right! That's great. So can I get a referral from you? Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed. But you said I'm totally healthy! ...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer? Yeah, but what's the quickest way? Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver? Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay.   Stan? Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon! SCORE!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?! Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival... One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush! Uh that is nice! That is nice! I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh? Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer!    Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing. No, Peter Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer. Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em. Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies.  See? Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed? I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed. Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh? Hey. My eyes are up here. It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe.  Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please? Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over? Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high? What do we want? Where do we want them? What do we want? Where do we want them? Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls.  Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir.  And when it gets cold it shrinks.  Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now? Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend? ...Oh okay.  So I'm, I'm not your friend then? ...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend? Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr? Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends? Oh cool! Okay.  Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma? Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her! That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it.  Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back. Stan, poke your grandma! Yahtzee! Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore? Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then? You just had to push it, didn't you, Stan? You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again! Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks! Mr. Cruise, my son is so, so sorry, and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments. Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box...  We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages... Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer again.  ANYTHING! Anything you want, Mr. Cruise. Sure! Who is it? We can get anybody for you. That's... tricky... Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we- Okay, people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park. Alright, Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I've done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today.  Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad. Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo. Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, not even showing his eyes?   Aw. Aw, it's just a stupid threat! Come on, we don't wanna piss off Tom Cruise again.  What the hell was that?! Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved.  Helllo? Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you. There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they're gonna bomb us. Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise. Well, yeah.  Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you. Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?  She's destroying everything! We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is. I don't really work out. People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands.  More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey. Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own. Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next? Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?! Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography! Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own! There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help. We could ask Al Qaeda. Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them. People from Jersey? What is it? That thing is famous? Why? Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this.  Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?! What does that mean?! Stop playing stupid!  What are you people planning?! Yup. They're from Jersey alright. This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey!   Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey! Then we've got to start falling back to Utah! It's Al Qaeda!  On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden.  On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences.  We got him! Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now. What does that mean? What?! Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible? What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?! That does it!  I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too! Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son! I said get me in there! Ahhh. Stan?  Stan! Yes, it's me, Stan. It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly! I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings! I was gonna, but ooh! This is fun! Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.  Aah ahhh aha ahhh. Aw, dammit.  Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon? It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous! I mean, hello! Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace.  What the hell is that?  Who put that there? I don't know. I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools.  Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time. Ugh. I'm not staying up to do ''that'' Sharon, jeez! Psseh... huh...  Oh yeah. Fuck. Mmm, God damn. Yeah. Yeah, it's fuckin' money. Aw yeah? Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah.  Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again! Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and heirloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww... No! Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!   Aw yeah, look at that. I worked all day! I can watch what I want!  ...Yeah. Whoa. See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo. Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!  Aww, stupid commercials.  Come on! Bohh-riiing.  Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm. Channel blocked?  Sharon, what are you doing? I wasn't watching food channels! I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw!  Crème fraîche. Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?  Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven? Yeah? You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan? If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan. Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing? Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah. WAH! Sharon! Hello there, children! How's it goin'?  The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great? I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche. Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli. Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah. Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.   Fraîche. Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh... Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah. Quiet on set, please.  Back from where?  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay! Talk to me?! Oh Jesus! Yes chef! No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream! Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay! Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes! Jamie Oliver!  Behind you!  I'll be right back! Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche?? I don't have time! I'm cooking right now! You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!  I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode! Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Ugh, I'm tired. Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything? I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Kenny, it's time for dinner!  AAAA! Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea. But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t- Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key. Round 2. Fight!!  Pre-nup power-up.  Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, "How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook"  Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book? Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress?  Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends... Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom, which is Tom Cruise's house... In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer.  L-later, at the Legion of Doom. Meanwhile, at the concert stage Jesus built with his power of super-carpentry...  Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair... Meanwhile... We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300.  Let the race begin! It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way! We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.   The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car. It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car.  They are neck and neck approaching the finish line.  Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team. Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the "Jersey News" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi! Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age.  And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP. Next on Food Network it's Paula Deen  We'll be right back to Good Eats. Now back to Good Eats. Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge! And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something. All right, sex addicts. What other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall?  Anyone have another example? Let's see, how about... David!  "Sex with employees." Definitely a danger there. What else? Uh, Mr. Clinton. Very good, Billy.  "cigars in vaginas." Not the best idea there. Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive  "Internet porn." Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row. And would you care to share your stories with us, boys? Billy! Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off! Alrighty. Now, we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament, don't we? What is the main thing we've all learned to avoid?  Yes, Tiger? No, no, Tiger, you still aren't getting it.  In order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors, we must avoid... anyone? Avoid getting... anyone? Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone! Very good! You are all here in therapy  because you got caught! So how do we avoid getting caught? Ben Rothlisberger? Good, yes! Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.  We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all! Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense. The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall! This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers. Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees. When they uh ask you for money, pay them. I can feel it! I'm free! Putting cigars in girls' vaginas? Does your mom have big tits?  Sorry...  What the fuck are you talkin' about? Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body! Watching Internet porn all day every day? Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos? Hey Kyle, hi Kyle. I heard that.  Aw, gee whiz! Avoid drugs? And alcohol? That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies! Auugh! Caught. Getting caught. Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms? So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success. You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women?? The birthplace of our country. Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country.   Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard. Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.  We have a turd in the punch bowl. Quick, give that boy a gun!  Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs.   Shoot it boys! Keep shooting it! We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell.  Entrance is clear, Mr. President.  Right side clear!  Hey, what are you doin- No. No, come on.  Where are you takin' me? Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts. Turd in the punch bowl.  Ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in Independence Hall. By all accounts, the alien is also a wizard, who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country.  We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness? There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.  You'd better take one too.  I got a baaad feelin' about this.  You gotta reload!  Shoot him in his blabber mouth!  We are healed! Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read. Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list.  It's called ''The Catcher In The Rye'', and it has some very... risqué parts...  ...and strong vulgar language... ...and in fact, many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate. Tonight, I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the- Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by ''The Catcher In The Rye'', but he was just a kook!  You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language! Hey, is that fudge packer Tom Cruise? Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed!  Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed? No, don't!  Is that okay to show? No, you could still see his eyes...  Stop! There's some extremists, threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they're gonna bomb us! Eric, what are you doing here? What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean- Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and- Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop- No, Mr. Hat, don't say anymore! Eric, I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.  All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I ''won't''. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer. Please don't. We have to protect 'em. They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions! Jesus! Why are they doing this? What are you talking about? He's still questioning that new prisoner. Awww! Eeeeewwww!  Hi Ranger Pete. John Lennon's dead, Butters. Really amazing. Hello Matt Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented. Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course. But we are very very proud nonetheless. Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded! We don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed, and now it's now OKAY to show Muhammad.  Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?! And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it! Aaagh! Get it off of me! Shoot it!  Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy? "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"?  Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this! This book! Our son and his friends wrote it! Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good! I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid! Nono, just keep reading. I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end. Randy please! You've got to listen to me! Well? Right? It's not just me. What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean. Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this. Wha... WHAAAAA?!   Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger. Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again?  Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really- I'm sorry, I just... Yeah. Great. Randy, I love it!  Yyyup! Oh, Linda, huh? Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah. Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart.  Wow. What? You people are crazy. Sheila? Sheila, who are you talking to? Is it them, Randy? Yes, our son has always been fairly clean. Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker. Off chart? What does that mean? Who are the experts?  What next dream level? Why? What's that? So like a nightmare? Why can't you wake up from that? That doesn't sound very difficult. Why? Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what? Okaaay... Okay, wait. Who's Hasselbeck? Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player? Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream? Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea! Will they be able to wake Mackey up? Why? Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died. Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy? Well take it down. It's noisy.  You coming?  Randy, do not watch that no-no channel. Alright, come to bed soon.  Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?! Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made. Just using the parental controls to block some channels. Then how do you know I blocked them? Randy! Marsh! I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop. It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all. Like I have time to go to the gym every day. Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights? Oh I didn't realize there were different models. I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones. Well I don't know- Thank you, Shake Weight. Hahhh. Oh wow. Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess! You think your father's gonna listen to me?!  Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.  Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!  I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME! Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this. Oh, thanks Shake Weight. You're right. Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.  A workout? Right now? I don't really like working out in public. Oh God, not right now. Ugh, I'm tired. Oh, where is that sleep mode button? Ugghh.   Ahhh. "Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?  Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight! Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company. I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!  Randy, I'm back. Randy, we should talk. Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning? What'd you say? Can I try something? You gonna go back to the kitchen? No, I'm good, thanks.  Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you? I'll remember that now, thanks to you. Goodbye, Shake Weight. Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow! Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear. We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least. We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it. How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?  Where did you hear that? A new family moved in? Where are they from?  New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?  Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know? Never invite a New Jersey housewife into your home.   All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!  That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool. That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or or, somehow, you know, hold it against me. You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing.   Kyle? You in there? Kyle, open the door. Kyle, this instant! One, two.  I guess we need to talk. I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle. When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus. I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey. It isn't so bad, Kyle, a lot of people think the Jersey look is nice! Sharon, I'm so sorry. Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon. There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight? Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read. Yeah, it's really amazing. Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers! Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town. But our homes and our lives are at stake.  Muff cabbage?  Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel. It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called "literary genius." ''The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs'' hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting. The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages. The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold "Butters" Stotch.  Hey, here he comes! Amazing book, Butters.  You've changed my life, young man. Hey hey, you guys leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist. Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy? He's so brooding and full of angst. Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once.  Oh God, you guys are pathetic! Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me. Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents. You must be pretty proud of your son. All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's  Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested? Hi everyone. And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct? Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings?   Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people? Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading ''The Catcher in the Rye''? Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters. That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes. You just fail to understand what the author meant. Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country. What book did you read?!  No, no no, that's such a simplistic view. Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason? But what would be the point? No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly. It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class. Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature! Yes they would! Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake?  Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room.  Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about? Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book? A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little "superhuman" themselves. They call themselves "Coon and Friends," and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis. Their little "super club" consists of seven young heroes.  The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote,  "a dick". Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news. Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed. That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman. Al, how is it out there? Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat.  And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith.  Chapter 2... "Why are we here?" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all. "The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs." "And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt." Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think? So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book. What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets! I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots. Some of the imagery is unbelievable Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh?  Didn't like what the book had to say? "And the poop and the pee lived happily every after. The end."  Kill the phonies. Kill the phonies! Yaaay! Can I go with you girls?  Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading ''The Poop That Took A Pee'' by Leopold "Butters" Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians..  wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book. Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK!  Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty. You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises. Alright kids, practice is over for today.  Can I help you, sir? Oh, yeah, sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here. Sure. New state laws say it's okay. Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference. Well, sir, we just can't sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary. I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store. Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal. Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure. Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous. Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour. Well, Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal. Yep, you check out fine. For what? Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana. Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. ''You'' are in fine shape! Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer. The what? Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer. Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re- Your prescription for what? What the hell is going on? This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.  We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy! And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us.  The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient. Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there? Alright honey, let's take it easy. Please, leave my boy alone! No please! Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs? Well, all right.  All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?  Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!  No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!  Eric, poopsie? Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job. Yes, Mysterion?  Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I? Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!  Eric Cartman! Where have you been, young man?! Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man! Eric, are you listening to me?!  What? What do you mean "what should-"  It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there. Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas. No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal. Can I help you? Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-  -your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours.  This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.  If you don't want it, that's fine-  Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls! No, I mean, your actual balls! Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned. Heh! Man, I am stoned off my ass! I don't know. I guess we'll see. I don't know. We have to give in to their demands. That'll be Tom Cruise...  Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed. Protect... the Denver Broncos. Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here! How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski?  Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it!  Maybe he really is stupid, Randy. That's the last of it! We're out of ammo! Who is that?!  Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC. Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house. Ahhh Eric Cartman, right? Suuure.  I have my sources. That'll be $85. Hold on, hold on.  You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up. Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides. I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it? Excellent. Cartman my boy, you got the stuff? Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you! That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little "arrangement" with the Colonel himself. That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do? Excellent. What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken! ...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution! How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric! What is that supposed to mean?  You wouldn't do that. Mommy, no! There he is! Hey, Mackey!  Come 'ere!  You snitched and told the principal I was smoking. You're gonna die Mackey!  Come back here! You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is the field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget! See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man!   Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya. We wanna be in Mackey's group! There he is! You can't run forever! You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so!  Alright Mackey. Take this.  Maybe I am. Who's askin'? Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money?  It's all there, man. 'Course, man, I ain't no fool. Awww, it's all the same shit, man. Okay okay I'm sorry, oh...  I'll take back the gravy. AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too!  What's going on back there? Freeze! Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal.  Okay, people, try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez. Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself.  Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy. Women love huge balls? Aw some on, just give us a little bit. Yeah. Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa?  When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil- To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors. If you develop an allergic reaction, see your doctor. In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss. Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic! Just terrific what you boys are doing. Hey ladies, are you looking for a better workout? Introducing the Shake Weight. A spring-loaded workout device you pump with your arms. Just grab the piston and go to work. One-handed or double-fisted. You just shake it. Back and forth. Best of all, Shake Weight tells you when your workout is finished by chiming and releasing a cool-down spray.  Order now and we'll include the optional heart rate monitor. Just put your finger in the tester.  Get yours today. Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in.  Doctor? I'm stoned off my balls!  Wow. Those guys have nice balls. Mmm. For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do. It feels really good in my hands. Wish my man had balls like those. Little boy, what are you doing?  Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit. I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend. Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver.  And how do I know you're not a liar too? I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time. Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me.  Hello. Hello?? What happened? Eric, what happened?? I heard. Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric! There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker! I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me! We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key? Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you! Run Billy, run!  Bigger doors! Weed stores! Bigger doors! Weed stores! Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.  Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?  I just wish I had brought an umbrella.  I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.  It's burning Man! Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others. Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request? Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess!  I'll take ten lemon bars. You'll never stop him, you know.  The Great One.   What's ridiculous about it? Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff. Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed. It's the cops!  Sharon, you got a scrotum coat? Luckyyyyy!  Mom, Dad! I made a friend today! Yeah!!  Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading. Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?!  Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar! Yeah!  Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year. He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'! Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner? Wow, thanks!  Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah! Kip, really? What's his name? Oh, is he a nice boy? That's great, Kip! It's amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?  Oh, what'd he say about those? I think the more time you spend with your little friend, the better. Have fun and be safe!  No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now. You did? Huh son, that's wonderful. They sure are getting to know each other. His friend lives on a farm? So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today? Sounds like you boys had a ball! Well it's a little late, but it is Friday. Honey, where's Kip? I haven't seen him all day. Am I a joke to you? I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke? You '''do''' have a Facebook page, Stan! Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single? You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends! And you'd '''better''' change your relationship status to "In a relationship"! By editing your profile under "basic information"! "I think you look cute in your bunny costume." "I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?! That's what Susan92 wrote on your Facebook wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you!  Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.  Stan? We need to talk about your locker.  Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.  It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker. No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help, I don't know how much longer I could be with you! Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan. Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding? Fine!   I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Stan Marsh. I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid. Alright get moving, Profile. Ignore.  Tom Davis says hello to Linda Green's profile. Linda Green likes how Tom Davis has changed his status. Ignore. Ignore.  Hey. Oh yeah?  No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend? Ignore.  So anyway, I really like taking long walks in the summer, you know, because there's like  Oooo, Tom Davis is thrilled to have become powerful by adding a new friend. Here are some pictures of my dog. And here he is in some silly outfits. Can you comment on these? Oh oh. Looks like I'm gonna be down a friend.   Move it, profile!  Play, profile! They're taking him to the gaming arena. You are about to face each other in combat! You will play the game for the amusement of the users!  One round only! Begin!  Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated! That's not what your profile said. Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now. After him! Let the final battle begin!  Uhhh, I'm gonna count five in my five box. Hello. Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off. Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm. Randy Marsh is at work right now. Work is boring. Butters Stotch is enjoying Stan's chat party. Herbert Garrison likes Butters' comment. Grandma Marsh would like to be friends with Kevin Donahue. Kevin Donahue accept's Grandma Marsh's friendship. Susan92 has pictures of Stan in a bunny costume. Gary Johnson thinks the pictures are fantastic! Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend. User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock. Ignore.  Right here. I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you.  Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world. Who is more powerful? The user or the profile? Let's end this once and for all.  What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little- What?! No. Can't be. No! Ahhhhh!  Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk. And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world. What did you call me? I'm not a fudge packer! But I'm not a fudge packer!  I'm not. I'm a very busy actor. I'm just trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing!  Oh, that does it. I will SUE you! You can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it!  That's it!  I'm suing this entire intolerant town! No buts! You wanna to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences! Guys, I want to really thank you all for coming. Shockingly, I've just been slandered once again in the town of South Park, something I know you can all relate to.  Yeah, well, I was just over there doing some fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer!  Yeah, well, I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want. Oh, just the door down the hall there, Jared.  That's a closet... No that- that's a closet too. That's nice!  WHAT? I am an actor. I do ''not'' pack fudge!  Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit. It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town- Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith. Well, then you can just get sued!  No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear in South Park, or your little town is DONE! No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look, people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander? Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power?  Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if nobody could call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage? By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule.  Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since ''Beetlejuice''. And, you put Johnny Depp and the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that! Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take his power from him.  Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me! Jennifer Lopez!  Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of. Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth. No Jen, we've all got enough money.  Mrs. Lopez... Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god  you found my fudge packing uniform... Rob, will the machine be ready? Yeah, so what's going on? What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?! Gingers? You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence? Oh, we can play that game too! You want to see violence, well you got it!    But the only way we are going to get Muhammad from South Park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers!  Her who? Oh right...  Her. Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us. We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand?  Oh, she's pissed all right. How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too! We ''will'' call her off when you give us Muhammad! That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all! What?! Impossible! On screen!  ...Your ...boss? Let's do this. Throw the switch, Rob.  I've done it! I've done it! Look at me! I'm not okay to make fun of anymore! This is incredible. Who wants to go next? What did you say?!  You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?! Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of! I just... can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me. You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh.  Oh, please, can you show me where? I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit! South Park, Colorado, is the most racist, insensitive, and bigoted place in this country!  That town thinks they can say whatever they want about people and get away with it! If anyone has a gripe against that shithole, it's me!  O M G it worked! YEAH! Hey, Tom, I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?   Stan Marsh to the principal's office. Stan Marsh, come to the principal's office immediately! Did you call him a fudge packer? But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us. But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now? Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities! Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad.  Muhammad, would that be okay? You've done this town a huge favor, Muhammad.  What?! Jesus, what are we supposed to do?! They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay! But even if it were safe for Muhammad come, how would we ever find him? Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter?  Hoarding? M'kay, what's that? Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay? Me? ...Like, like what? DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKING MOUTH! M'KAY?! M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uh-kay? What?! What?! Jesus, what?!  Mmm-kay... Billy, ...Billy Thompson? Ohhhhhhh, m'kay. I sure did. I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay? Dammit, Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly kid in line?! Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like.  Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all? Alright, we'll put a sheet over him. Obviously, the terrorists are for real!  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah. You won't believe it... Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible! Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to ''definitely'' get bombed. Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.  You did? I'm sorry, Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over to the gingers. Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense! Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us!  Yeah, that would kill all our careers! Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park. You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed? I... I'd love it! Gee, that'd be swell. Who?  Alllloooo...  Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos. Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva! What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo! Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you! Oh, yes, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!  More tacos!  I want more tacos! More tacos. I want ''more'' tacos!  I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live! Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too? Yes they do! Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them. In the great hall of the Super Best Friends, there are assembled the leaders of the world's biggest religions; Jesus!   Their mission; to right back which is wrong, and to serve all mankind. Later, at the hall of the Super Best Friends... Captain Hindsight,  But now, the Hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume Jack's very soul. It's Captaiiin Hindsight! It's not semen, it's Seaman! Yeah. Who would have activated her again?  Look out! Barbra Streisand is using her toxic stink ray!  Our powers aren't working, Swallow.  It's Sea-Man and Swallow. Fine! Swallow, come.  I'll get you, Tom Cruise!  My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances. But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form. Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids!  Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses?  Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem. Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag! What? On the Super Best Screen! Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand!  I don't know, Seaman.  Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  We have to find another weak spot!  Moses! We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have! All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!  Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you. Let's hope to Christ this works.  Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise! ''Nobody'' is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!  Kyaaaaa! I guess maybe Tom Cruise ''likes'' Seaman.  Who's the creepy ginger kid? That's right. Don't you see, gingers? If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop. We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people Ohhh, and you're one to talk! With all your Internet porn! No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face. Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure.  But he's talking from the U-Haul?  Jesus Christ! We've got a distress signal coming in.  No good! We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!  That's it, Jesus. The band has been paid and the PA system is working. It worked, Jesus! No, 'cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble. Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul? Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay. What? Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond. Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that. Tom, Tom, you're talkin' crazy, mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him?  We take his goo! It's as simple as that people.  Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another.  Oh, it'll be ready!  Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent. Fine, then let's have ''Her'' do it.  You know... ''Her''. There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand. Power her up! Release the Kraken!   Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine! It's my goo machine! I'm next! If you know what's good for you, you'd keep your mouth shut, kid. Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo. You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo. You catch on quick kid...  Hurry, get my wig back on!  Where the hell do you think you're going? You gonna walk away from 50 mil?  You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life. Then I guess I won't tell you about your father.  Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right? You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along.  Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to, kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return. Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it? The name's Mitch Conner, flew the same division as you back in Saigon.  So you admit it. There was a cover up.  Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner. And that's that. "Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam."  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher. Sorry is a four letter word with a Y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid. Yeah, the old "Hasn't anything changed?" speech. Works on white people all the time. Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart? Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now! You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid. You might wanna   Hey, Eric, Eric! Come on, cheer up. Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool. Shut up, Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on. There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.  Welcome.  Okay. Oh, is that okay? Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again! Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that's still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume... Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!  Huzzah! You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else... Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know! Gingers? Aww, hell no. My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember. Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this? ''[Singing] Baabura, Baabura, ichi ban kirai na hito. (The number 1 hateful person.) Baabura, Baabura, hana ga ookii. (Her nose is big.)'' Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat.  I... I don't believe I know you. Dammit, Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered! Ohhhhhhh... Alright, Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with. What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood? Incoming!  Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son. We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick. Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One! Two! Three! So where is he?!  Hahaaa!  We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad! Why do you think we're calling?! Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you! That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus. Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' ''reeeally'' special planned for him. Sorry, boys. I tried.  That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear, and be willing to hurt people, and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.  I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you. Super Best Friends! You've got to help us! The Casa Bonita is under attack!  The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us! I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith. There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of.  Yes? What do you want? Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in. There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there. No, please, it isn't that at all. No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in.  WAAH! Eric Cartman? Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them. Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.  Very well. Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in!  Oh, all right. It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly. Yes? Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American. Beat it I'm not helpin' you! No no, you don't understand. Alright, alright, jeez.  What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go. It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.  Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone? Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog! Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house. No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone. AAAH! Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Oh boy! Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha! She's going to get our coffee store next. Ooooo, Jesus Christ.  Tom, Tom! The gingers are claiming they have Muhammad! They are sending a message now! Ooo you lucky fucker. I want to be next. Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us! Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this. Guess again.  Welcome, to my Chili Con Carnival. Oh, but it can.  chili.  Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric.   I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed! Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival! I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth! Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr...  The Denver Broncos.  There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name! Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos? The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!  Tell him! You almost did before, but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him! You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Now eat your chili!   Alright, Muhammad is secure.  No, gingers go next. They can't stop all of us! Get 'em! Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.  I just... I just can't seem to stop. Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel.     Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel? Oh yeah, just a sec.  Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.  That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a...   You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?! You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are!   Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch! No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday? Uh, oh, um, uh, just a sec! Hey, you owe me money, asshole! Heh, some people are so picky about their towels.  I feel like I could conquer the world.  It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine. Go away! I'm walking on sunshine! Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more.  Wha' what's goin' on? What is everybody doing here? Aw Jesus, man. I I don't, I don't get this. Could we just end this please? No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends. Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here!  Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low. Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry. All right. All right, I'll go. I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore. Yeah, hi.  I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel. Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year. We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Francis. Hey Francis! Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition. All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year? You too, Ne-n-Nathan. Gonna catch a wave...  Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes!  <poem><i>It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula dance<br />I fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.<br />And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.<br />So I made up my mind-</i></poem> ''So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.'' <poem><i>Hurr a little Tardicaca...</i></poem> <poem><i>She's a candy cane to wiggle</i></poem> <poem><i>She's sure to make you g-giggle.</i></poem> <poem><i>With her naughty little wiggle.

Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done.  Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ. Timmeh!  Timmy. Timmy! Timmeh! Timmih.  Hi Jimmy, hi Tim. Gee, I wish our team captain was as awesome as Jimmy.  Wow, look at Lenora everyone.  Come on, come on, where's the towel? There you go, Lenora, all better now?  All right, campers! Our first event is the big canoe race! All right, campers are we ready? Oh your mark, get set.  That's it, we're done! You are no longer employed here! We need a nice, clean towel here at summer camp. We don't need a towel that shoots heroin and has sex for money!   The towel isn't here. I think it's off getting high again.  Where is that towel?!  What's going on, Towel? We got wet campers down there! Move your ass! Who hired that towel? It can barely walk, let alone dry somebody off. All right campers, next event is the big scavenger hunt! Blue Team is gonna go first.  Oh we're weady aww wight. We can weawwy stick it to the wed team this yeaw, wahahahaha. Wait, look! He's doing it!  Ohh Wed Team. Your captain weawwy got waped. No way, Red Team can beat us, no way. Haha, hahaha. Uhuhuh. Don't worry, Jimmy can handle himself. I hope I never see it again. Ahhahahaha. Red Team won't know what hit them. Oh no! Jimmy! Yeah! Yeah!  Alright! I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.  Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that? What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.  Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him. I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good. Simple, Mimsy.  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe. Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a Black Mamba. Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready. Good luck, Jimmy. You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole. Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!  Not in our canoe, Mimsy! I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team. Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map. No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation. Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map! Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too. This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. "Turn left at the..." Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation! I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team! Miiimmmssssyyyy!  AAAAA! I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all. Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  It's a shark-mating whistle. No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf. Yes, Counselor Steve. The beach is warm.   Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle. Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you. You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh... Mimsssyyy! Get this thing off of meee! Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.  Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Dammit dammit! Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.  Yeeeah!  Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'? That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again! I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being. Shut up... Mimsssyyy.  Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha. Doh, sorry, boss. Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss? Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss? Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh?  Oh! It's a snake. Aww, dah, gee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh?  Darrr, you said to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss. Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh boss? Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt? Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss?  I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map.  Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss? Dahhhoh boy! Why sure it is, boss. No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it.  Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss? Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?' Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off.  Gee that was a close one, huh boss? They almost had me saying we were gonna kill Jimmy. Dohh boy!  Dahhh I got me a shark whistle. Dohoho, oh boy! Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle.  Dahh I don't think he's playing the right note, boss. The C4 aint gonna go off. Dahh okay boss.   Darrr we want the ukulele solo! We want the ukulele solo! Well we wants ya to play it, don't we?  D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss. Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss. Yes, thanks. Uhhh! Oh boy, the canoe races! Heeee!  Yeah I don't know, Timmy. Those waves are pretty big, heeeee. I've never seen a kid get screwed by a shark before. Heeee! We gotta be uh bitty bitty uh we uh we gotta be we gotta be uh we gotta bibbity beat the Red Team.  You boys excited for the canoe race?  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League! We crossth the finish line firsht!  Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there!  Are you boys enjoying the fun beach? Are you boys excited for the neat scavenger hunt? You must have one dusty computer. You wanna come over, have a seat with your friends?  We've all just been talking, Towelie, and and what I'm hearing is a bunch of people here who just love the heck outtaya. And, they're gonna way what they wanna say, and you're gonna say what you wanna say, and we're done. Okay? Ah ah Towelie, you need to let him finish. Kyle? You have to let him finish, Towelie. Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next? Kyle, we have to let people be allowed to finish during interventions. Kyle please, It is not your turn! Okay, Stan, you want to go next? If you say yes, we leave here, pack your things, get on a plane, go to a treatment facility in Southern California, it's all set up. Well Towelie, your friends don't wanna watch you kill yourself anymore. You've got so many people that just love the heck out of ya, Towelie.  He's goin', everybody. Hugs!  <poem><i>Wawawawander...</i></poem> <poem><i>Hula...</i></poem> <poem><i>Hula...</i></poem> <poem><i>Hula...</i></poem> <poem><i>Hula...</i></poem> What treatment?! What are you all talkin' about?! Hi, Towelie?  Towelie is definitely one of the most addicted towels we've ever seen here. He's probably the second most psychologically damaged towel I've come across since treating Kirstie Alley's towel, which, had seen some... uuff, some nasty stuff. Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR. Now who's ready for Saturday's big race?  We're really excited to be part of the fastest-growing sport in America!  I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled to watch NASCAR finally becoming recognized as a respected, legitimate sport.  Hey- that's a hot girl over there.  Sure she's hot. She's wearing a sweater.  What? Oh my God!   Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back. He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a level 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean. You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything. You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing!   You're watching Colorado FOX 11. Next on FOX 11 News, are NASCAR fans stupid?  Some people are starting to wonder after a NASCAR fan apparently got high on Vagisil and snuck onto the track, killing eleven people. Tom, the NASCAR fan got into a car here on Sunday and crashed in the lake behind me. He was later found to have ingested this  Maximum Strength Vagisil. And also Vagisil medicated wipes. Making NASCAR fans look ...pretty stupid, Tom. The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win. People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out.  It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?! It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile. Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, "Where is Captain Hindsight?" With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now? Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident.  The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement: Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign. The dark and evil Cthulhu is bringing his angry wrath down upon the Burning Man Festival, Tom. Cthulhu isn't behaving as most scientists had speculated, Tom, but the dark lord is wreaking havoc everywhere and- Tom, it appears that Bruce Vilanch has arrived on the scene wearing a rat costume. Passenger said the Carnival cruise line smelled like poop, but that that was an improvement. Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty.  Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race. And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child. Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day,  ...And available nationwide. This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently.  Patty? Patty? What?  Let me talk to her.  Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame.  HAAAAAAAAAA! Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil! Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems- Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves- Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver? Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?  The fuck are you doing?! Oh, son of a bitch! AAAAAA!  Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.  and the stupid. The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year. Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track? And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race. Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill. Thank you, Chris. Vagisil is very excited to be part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.  Geoff? Why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver? Yea, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill? Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill. That means you flip the switch that says "Engine."  Is he stupid or what? This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet! Check your bag please, sir?  No, no, see, this won't do. You can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track. Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name! You might be able to buy one in the gift shop.  Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track.  It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it!  Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous. Muff cabbage! Muff cabbage. Muff cabbage!   And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined! Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me. Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name? Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage!  I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you got a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they ''heard'' of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous! Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you ''seen'' how big that bitch's ears are? Ears out to here!  I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections. That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No. You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution...  Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch! Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off!  Okay, I love you. I love you.  I love you. I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am.  Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine. Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Meeee! Danielle was being a stupid bitch. I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage!  Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey. That's Danielle. She's from Jersey.  And that's Caroline. Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here! Get her, Sharon! Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch!  Who the fuck are you to tell ME what to do?! Psycho bitch!  So, Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out? Well, I gotta find somethin'.  My biceps are goin' flat. Take it easy. Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey. 'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey?  So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, "Who's from Jersey?", and people are all like, "Yo! Woo-hoo!" Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler.  And Sicilian. When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit. Sharon, just stay out of it!  I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing. Teresa! Calm down. Be the bigger person, Sharon! Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?!  Is my family crazy?! I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down?  I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey! What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago. What's up with that?! What's up with that?! Well, ''we'' are coming after ''you,'' South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing! Ve are very sore-y, but Cal-i-for-ni-a cannot afford helping you at this time. No, because U-tah is between Colo-rah-do and Cal-i-for-ni-a. Nevada. We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support. What's the point? Can't you see it's over?  'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!  I told you to shut up! Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much. Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what? We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio. Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go. Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time. Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house. I don't think so.  What? Whaaat?! Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bar quick! There's trouble! I don't know ''what'' the hell I saw. It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed the cigarette machine in half. It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too!  It's called a Snooki. It's very famous.  I don't know!  Snooo-ki.  Snooki smoosh. Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.  Snooki wants smoosh smoosh!  Smoosh smoosh! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh! Snooki get the smoosh in the... the tenth...  Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing.  You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing.  It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it.  Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah! Let's go creepin' in this town!  Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!  Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!  Tango is down, tango is down. Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan.  Mommy? Mommy? Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.   Broken toothbrush. But it's broken.  Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots. It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away? The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away? Now how about this empty aspirin bottle? Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then?  There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3. We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them. I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is.  It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats. Oh no, really? It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness.  Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding, or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals. It's pronounced "hoarder," and yes you are. Yes, you are hurting sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that. Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. float-  WAAH! HAAA! HAAA! Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second.  Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... now the cloud is near you, you... you reach out to it. It's the cloud of your memories, of your past,  ...your childhood perhaps, ...what do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud? What the hell is going on?! Oh Jesus. It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it. It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background. Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen. What are you doing?! Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state! It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous! Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine!  You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it. What is it?! I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here. Ah good, you're here. Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream. If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it. Because. Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn. Probably one of them in the dream. And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN!  Alright, that does it.  Get your coat. We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world. Hello, Freddy.  You're looking healthy. Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream. There's some good men stuck in there. Wife and kids. We need ya Fred. We had a country to protect! Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!  Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this. Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups. Ahhh, you're back, everyone!  Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problems, Mr. Mackey? Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?  ...Well I, that is I, I- Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder. But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep. No, but I just thought that- Oh my God! 'Scuse me, where are we? Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep. Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder. Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um. But I literally herd sheep. Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful. The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's. I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream. Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay? Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh... Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay?  Huhhhhh!  Shh. Be quiet. Shh. You've gotta be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there. Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?  Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay. Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay. Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll!  Okay. Okay. Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!  Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay! No, uh Billy, please, uh-kay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.  Oh Jesus... Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay.  It's the day of the big field trip. Oh Jesus. Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay. Oh that should be fun, m'kay.  Ahhhh... Oh boy! Woodsy Owl! "Give a hoot, don't pollute," m'kay. Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay.  Oh, boy I love that song. Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh. Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay?  Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah! But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay!  They're gonna kick it bad! I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay. Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god...  Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay? Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself! Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay? Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.  Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no!  No! No more, Woodsy.  It's dead... It's finally dead.  Alright.  Uh oh, something's wrong. The father. He's gone completely off chart. We don't even know. It's very simple: You see,  when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream. Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams. Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream. No. Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious. Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic. Where are we going? You don't mean... They're waking up. They're coming to.  Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool! Alright kids, everyone on the bus. Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!  Get that door closed! Keep me covered!  What's the sitch?! Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream.  We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream. But your husband will think we're in Hasselbeck's dream. Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains! Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time. You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move!  Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream? Oh well. Just keep shooting! Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead! We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream. The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed!  Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl. I am. Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete. Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem. But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl.  Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six. That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in. Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,  So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream? A double-decker taco supreme. Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream?   Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic. What's happening? What the hell's going on? Thanks, Freddy. So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying "Give a hoot, don't pollute" and touching his penis with his wing? Those people are gonna die if we don't do something! Can we try a helicopter? Get back, kids. It isn't safe. Keep those children back, Thompson!  He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight!  Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come! Yes. All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up.  But, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we? Like a taco within a taco? Somebody order a pizza?  Somebody... order pizza? Pizza? Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work? Told you a long time ago: I gave that up.   It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house.  No thanks to you. Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?! Protect it yourselves this time. Then you should have no problem covering it up.   Alright, fine. There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy!  If only I could have saved the sheep herder. No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay? My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening.  Yes, Toolshed.  ...What? I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work. It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know. Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!  Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden. Let's work, people!  Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.  Uh oh!  What's the alert, Mosquito? What? A fire? Coon volume up!  My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out! Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl.  We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends!  Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown! Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now! Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time!  Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!  Come on, Coon Friends! All right, what seems to be the problem? Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon! Please sir, you must let us- Shut! Up! Mom! God! Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start. The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out. What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?! So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!  I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us! You aren't going anywhere, Chaos! You've got poop, don'tcha?  Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends? I CARE! There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?! Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up!  Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends. Oh no! Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends! Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on!  All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet. Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2?  We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it. Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho! That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan! Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?! You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!   A bake sale? We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!  You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind? Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything! Oh, what are you, the boss now?!  Sounds awesome. Let's do it.   Just like before and all forgotten? Right right? Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends?  My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends! Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension? Okay, what? You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends. You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon! You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys! Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!  You've gotta be fucking kidding me! Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW!  Yes yes, I am the Coon. Ya have? Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now. Yes, of course.  This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans! Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here!  Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!  What should I do?  Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious.  Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?! Yeeheah! Yeah, fuck all o'you! Lick my balls! <poem><i>Now begins a new adventure for... MEEEE!</i></poem> <poem><i>Sending all my stupid friends to oblivion!</i></poem> Suck it, bitches! Gather around, believers in good, and listen to the newest installment of The Coon. It all began when the BP Oil Company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension. Seeing the disaster on Coon-Vision, the Coon immediately called together his trusty Coon Friends. As the Coon explained how the disaster could be stopped, something terrible happened. Without warning, the Coon friends changed. Their superpowers morphed somehow, turning them into... supervillains.  I will not rest until that happens. Hi Mom. Just doin' stuff Mom. Are my friends downstairs in the secret base?  The Coon's mother appears to be extremely upset. In order to get past her, I must use the LeBron James technique.  Mom... what should I do? What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do? Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!  So, what's goin' on? No, I, I know. That's cool, I understand. Even though I started it and the secret base is in my house. Yes, that's totally understandable. No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?  Hm. Ah, all right, look. You guys were totally right, okay? That's all I wanted to say. That and... there's a double rainbow outside. Double rainbow, you guys. You don't see 'em often, but there's one outside right now. You've gotta come see!  Isn't it beautiful you guys? You are correct, Human Kike! Not that supervillains like you guys could ever see a double rainbow! Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice! Nuh uh, you guys are the bad guy.  He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place! No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!  Aww! Dude, that was awesome! You're all like "Mehhhh" and they were all like "Nooo!" All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man.    No nonono! Excuse me! It is not Cthulhu, it is Coon and Friend! I'm a little sick of everyone giving him all the credit when I'm the one really making the world a better place!  Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch. After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped. Yep, that's him. So long, Justin Bieber, you little douchebag!  It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice. Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95. Kenny? What the hell? I sent you to the- It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny! I'm going around making the world a better place! Right, that's what superheroes do.  Don't listen to him Cthulhu! We have more important stuff to do! Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me!  Fuck you, Kenny! Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out! This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat! Fuckin' Mintberry fuckin' Crunch. Why do we have to be called "Coon and Friends"? We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"? Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house? Oh Jesus... How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love? Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out! To the grocery store! There's more important things to discuss right now! We all voted, it was unanimous. Toolshed! Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends? Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more! The Necronomicon? All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base! Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight. Um dude, are you okay? Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.  All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing! "It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu." We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys. Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu? "In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite? Toolshed! Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you! Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny! Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!  Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry? ...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly- And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion? ...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible- ...Woo-hat? ...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.  Kenny Kenny, calm down. Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!  Kenny? No! No! Uh-what? Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember? Dude, where the fuck are we? Oh shit! We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here. How, dude? Oh my God! Kenny! Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mintberry Crunch. Ya got poop, don't ya? Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool? Oh my God! Holy shit dude!  Yeah. We wanna be called "The Extreme Avenger League." Why not? So what's the huge catastrophe? I don't wanna tell him either. TupperWear! What's a mythos? What the hell?! TupperWear! Okay! I was in a car accident, then put back together with Tupperware parts. Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends? Have, so. There's like a big fire or something in town. And friends! Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it. ...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like. Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero. I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale. I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people. And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch! No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan?   Right. Mosquito! That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars. Ten. Yes sir!  Stop who? I knew it! Cartman tore our base up! Right, Toolshed!  Let him go!  Coon and Friends, ho! Mosquito! Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass! Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need. I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt. What are you talking about? You guys, I wanna go home. Look, maybe we should just find a place to hide and wait for help. Kenny!  Timmeh! Timmeh! Timmah! Timmah!   Timmeh! Tih-Timmieh!  Like milk? Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor!  More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.  Right right. Mint Berry Crrrunch!  Mint-Berry Crrunch! P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean.  Wuh uh okay, if you insist. Uh see ya, Kenny. Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion? Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.  Mint-Berry Crrrunch! Mint-Berry Crunch!  Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.  Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.  Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go!  We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good! The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes.  It's him! My God, it's really him! There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them. Yes, of course. Thank you, Captain Hindsight! Wait. Look! Up in the sky! Thank youuu! What's the skinny? Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it. And then you see that building to the left? They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to.  What seems to be the problem?  Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling? It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill! Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.  Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve! My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need! Please, sit down. What can I do for you?  Of what? Go ahead. Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened. Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner! Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse. Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone. Get this kid out of here! I have to think! I can't help anyone right now! Something came up. Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk? Look at those photos on the desk.  'Course it's Courtney Love! I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening! I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-  So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me! I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!  Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!  You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love! Alright enough! What's going on?! It's not Courtney Love? No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?! NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all! It doesn't matter.  As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore! Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?! Wha-? What is your power?  What should I do?  Seriously, what should I do?  Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?  Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously. Yeah, so? We've got to help those people! I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends. Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish. Hey fellas?  Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now.  And I ain't got nothin' to eat. Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love. Uhhh ohhh... But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been- Huhey, can I see the double rainbow, fellas?  Uh, fellas? Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends? Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene. My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf! Agreed. We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk! Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways. He means we need to discuss things with you! Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him! But we get the headquarters and all the equipment. We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman?  Please escort the Coon out of our secret base. I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized. But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension. Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge. I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am!  Thank you, ma'am. We believe that every little bit helps. Mysterion! Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny. I don't know, but I think we'd better find out. Not Cartman. Whoever did this to our base was looking for something. Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?! Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you! Please sir, put down the gun. Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy! You guys go! I'll deal with this prick! I said it's fine! Just go!  People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid. You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?  Maybe I should just... disappear.  I'm fine. So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time. Uhh, what?  I'm not here about that. Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult. Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?!  What happened at those meetings? I don't find that hard to believe at all. These people still meet? Where? There must be clubs like this all over the world. Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.  What does it mean? "That is not dead which can eternal lie"? What does it mean?!  You're going to tell me everything you know!  I can't die! No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!  Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard! All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER! Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!  I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.  Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?! It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you? What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from. Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about! What are you doing with that thing?! I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before.  Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help.  I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong.  Ow! That fucking HURTS!  How to I fight him?  That god you pray to just took away all my friends. How do I fight him?! Tell me what that means!  Old Ones? That's it! That's the place I just was! And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die? Wherever Cthulhu is! Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers. You don't understand! Hey, fat boy! To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?! You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU! For you! You're making it a better place for you! No! This is what superheroes do!  Bring back my friends! Take me!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy! Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss! No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back! Come back, you fat piece of shit!  Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed.  All right, this looks like a jolly good place. Yes. Let's let her rip.  That's it, lads. Collect that oil!  Oh, don't tell me we did it again? Uh oh!  Oh deah. Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp! Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.  It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned. Aha! I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight. If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans. Yes. Yesss, YESSS. God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!! My God, he's right!  Can I help you? Yes? The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis. Mr. Hindsight, sir.  This young man would like a word.  Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf! What, sir? You know you can tell me. Yes sir. My God, is that you and... Courtney Love? But when did you have a- That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done! Sir! SIR!  The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire! Right.  Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying! Yes? The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement: Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error.  The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.  We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it.  Sohr-ry. Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another "I'm sorry" campaign to please everyone this time. Wait a tick!  Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this! We drill. I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill. We got into this mess by drilling heuh  Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.  Oh, she'll take it.  Sorry.  We're sorry.   Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do?   What should I do? Or should I tell you, "I am not a role model."   Should I accept my role as the villain?  Where are you, Captain Hindsight? Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time! Oh, what a right pickle we're in.  There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in. How, by Jove? Drill of course, yes, yes, of course. I don't quite get it. That looks extremely promising! The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it? The Human Kite! That's definitely the last of them. What do you mean "Not Cartman," dude? Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out. My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I- Here we go: "The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them." Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago. Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents. Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids? I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion?  Human Kite! You bastards!   But then what exactly is your superpower? And shoot lasers out of my eyes.  When was that?  Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die. Dude! Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next? Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from. You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason! You should fuck off, that's what you should do. Wait, Mintberry Crunch ya you might not wanna go-  There's no double rainbow, fatass! Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us! Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy! Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!  We aren't going that way! What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here. Kenny, where the hell are you going? You... you crazy bastard!  And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs.  You're not going anywhere for a long time! Well, come back and visit any time, dude. Kenny? No! Nooo! Awwww! The Coon? I've heard of that. I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends. Can I ask you a question? Do you know Mint-Berry Crunch? What's he like?   Clyde, do you hear me? You're hoggin' it all, asshole!   You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again! And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night.   We were? I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited. They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen? It's happenin' again!   ''ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn''. "Even Death may die."  The Old One has awakened!  Now let us read from the Necronomicon. "That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons"  The child is right, you know. Cthulhu sees all, hears all. The dark lord wants us to dispense of this one, kids. Give us a hand. Just hold still and it will all be over quickly.  Sorry kids. It's a little late for that.  I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.  Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school? Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself.  Who the F'n H is that? It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever. Hardcore goth. Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody. Ugh, whatevs.  I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled. Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before  It's like Obama all over again. Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright? Luckyyy... Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel. No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness.  "And with strange aeons even Death may die." Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser. Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth. We're dark lord minions now, wuss. What'd you think we'd be doing? This freaking sucks! We worshiped and prayed to Cthulhu, went to all the cult meetings, but life is still totally freaking gay. Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again. Dark deities that existed before man. You've been to the nightmare city of R'Lyeh? Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at? Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out.  Small white ones, yes ma'am.  Standard or voice assist model? I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout. A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers. Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...  Where are you Captain Hindsight? Aggh!  Nobody's stopping Cthulhu now! All will be sadness. Life will become death, and I will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck. <poem><i>Cthulhu Cthulhu, Cthulhu Cthulhu.</i></poem> <poem><i>The evil hate-filled Cthulhu, from a dimension far away.<br />Flying through gates of madness and into your heart</i></poem> <poem><i>Turning dreams into nightmares</i></poem> <poem><i>Destroying all he sees</i></poem> <poem><i>You and the dark one, Cthulhu</i></poem> Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mintberry Crunch!  That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch! Rrright! The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch! Nono. Mintberry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants! Is he? Oh Jesus!  A what? A double rainbow? Shablagoo!  Waaaaaaaaaah!  And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mintberry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him! Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mintberry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists! Mintberry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion!  Hey Mysterion, wait up!  Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going? What? But he'll kill you. Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.  Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you.  Mysterion, no! What are you doing?! ...Uh yes. Yes, please go on. Wow! I will, father. No more running away for... Mintberry Crunch!  I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister.  Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis. Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents. I will. Shaaablagoo!  Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you. Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley.  Go away Mom, I hate you. Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here! Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them.  It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension. Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world. The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal.  Get out of my room, TWERP! Will you guys play with me? Please, can I just- oh g'uh!  Mysterion is here! He must have come for my help.  <poem><i></i></poem> Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch. Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one. Your mother and I sent you as far away as we could. Use your power, son. Save Earth. Shablagoo!   Mmm, just look at that rack of ribs; now those are slow-cooked, and then braised to bring out the smokey flavor.  Mmm, that is MONEY right there! Hey y'all. Tonight we're gonna be makin' some deep-fried chicken. Muh buttery whipped potatoes and we're gonna be finishin' off with a chocolate pecan pie. Hello, and welcome to Progressive.  Well, you've come to the right place.   Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance. Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there. Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action. We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over. Now let's get that on the grill. Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for. Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing. Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is- A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme? And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen , and Giada De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head.  These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again. The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient. Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say "crème fraîche." Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say "crème fraîche." Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to? I'm making a pan-roasted chicken. Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes. Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me? I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard.  I was thinking about shallots, actually. Help you find anything?  You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms.  You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting. Come on now. Almost finished.  Your workout is finished.  Here is some cab fare. Now going to sleep mode.  This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout. That's it. Work it. Harder, faster. You are independent and strong. Switch arms. You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger.  Faster. Harder. You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to. You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident. Tell me again about the women who you do not like. Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful.  How about a quick workout? Just a quickie. You can do it. Come on. You can do it.  You have not worked out in seven hours. Come on. Let's get to it. You have not worked out in seven hours. Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast? Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please. That's it. Good.  ...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What?  This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break. You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like. You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest.  I guess my work here is finished. Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress. It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer. <poem><i>La lalala la la...</i></poem> <poem><i>Lalalalala la, fraîche, fraîche.</i></poem> <poem><i>Crème fraîche, Cafeteria Fraîche. Lalalalala fraîche.
