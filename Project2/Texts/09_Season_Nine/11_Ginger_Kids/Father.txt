What? Heh, hello there, kids.  Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals. Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds?  Each one of them's a blessing. Huh Blesse-blessing full of love. No... no, I'm sure they do.  Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started. Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene.
