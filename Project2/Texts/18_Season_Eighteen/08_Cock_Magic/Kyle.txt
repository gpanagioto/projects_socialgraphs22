But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight. Can Kenny block his Elderbeast? He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade! You've never seen anything so ruthless! Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok. It doesn't even look like they're open.  It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of. Yeah, maybe that's just kind of what they do naturally. Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass! You were? Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything. We don't... really know the difference. Then he's perfect for us. Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us? You can do it, McNuggets!  All right, McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?! You mean there's more to this? It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives. Yeah, you gotta know people. This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo. McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play. Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude. Come on, Kenny!  He just had to shuffle it. Holy shit, dude! Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened. Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now? Got what?
