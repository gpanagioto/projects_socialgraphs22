Hey, is that fudge packer Tom Cruise? Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed!  Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed? No, don't!  Is that okay to show? No, you could still see his eyes...  Stop! There's some extremists, threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they're gonna bomb us! Eric, what are you doing here? What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean- Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and- Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop- No, Mr. Hat, don't say anymore!
