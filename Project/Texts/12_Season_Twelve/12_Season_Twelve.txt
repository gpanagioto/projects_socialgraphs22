AHHHHHH. What? No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom! No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all! ...Ice cream? Well...you did say ''free'' ice cream?   Uh. It's over?  Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom! All right, so where's my ice cream? You were right, doctor! Everything is okay! What's that supposed to mean?! I HAVE AIDS? "''Sorry''"?! You gave me AIDS and you're "''sorry''"?! Mom, you said nothing would go wrong! No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!  Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE! NO! ''NOOOOOOOO''! God damn it, this sucks ass! Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die! Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it! Where the hell is everybody?  So this is it? Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap! Just bring out Elton John already! Jimmy Buffett?! Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!  Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck! Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS! Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday. Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease. ...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  OH YEAH, it'S REAL FUCKIN' FUNNY, KYLE! NO YOU DON'T! If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any goddamned second, Kyle!  Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?! Ironic how?  Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!  Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!  Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at. Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do. I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.  All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access. Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  Pass me the ball!  Kyle, what the F?! Kyle, what?! Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it? Nothing! Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale.  Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p- Kyle! Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!  Kind of.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle. See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys.   Kyle, where are you going? What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!! Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you! No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope. Break my Xbox and you'll never know. NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson. He was a basketball player. So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!  My God... We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible. Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS. Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason! We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares!  Oh uh, you know, all over cancer. Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease. No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  Magic Johnson, here we come.  I know. I'm scared too. We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. Kyle, we need to try to find a-  I don't think it's funny, Kyle.  Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-  Are you sure?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle! Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk. All right!  What?! Aw, no! What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha. What? No. No.  Kyle, no! Yeah, but we totally don't. Aw dude, that's our town! That's enough to buy slaves!  Sweet! We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole!   All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'. Cat pee?  All right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine.  Okay, ready Kenny? All right, bring out...! The other male cat.  Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed?   Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny! Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls. Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you? Ah, Kenny!  Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Here. Write a diary. Yeah, who has cats these days?    Who is it?!  Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another. I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more... What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here! Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties. He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude. They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand!  But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong.   Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle. Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life. Oh God, I'm bored already. Gayness!  We don't care. *urp* God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!  No! NOOO! We are NOT... resorting to that! How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?  Wait. I've got it. There's more people viewing it! Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob. Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet! Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year. Sweet. I think we're next in line now. ...You are a homo, Butters.  Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here. Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!  Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal. Yes!   Yeahhh. Who's teacher?! That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!  Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning. That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me? Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks. Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test. Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk? Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around. Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.  Your new teacher. I am here... to teach you calculuuus. Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu. Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge How do I reach these keeds?  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top. No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy. Go ahead, the door's right there.  How do I reach these keeds? Nice form, compadre.  Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?   Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo! What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing.  Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds? Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me. Good. Again. Again! Now you sound like white people! The answer to #27 is 5. The answer to #28 is 14. All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?  All right, let's go get you an abortion. Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you? Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life. Mexicans are told not to cheat. "Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child." So then ''you'' have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest. Uh what? Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them. How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives. You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.  I reeached these keeeds. Let's be partners, Kenny. Okay.  Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.  Uh who else needs a partner? God damn it! That isn't necessary! You can let go now, Butters. Butters, come on! I wanna shoot an Indian. Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything! Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme! Fine, then let go of my hand! Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?! Fine, then you're comin' with me! Butters, let go God-damn it! Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay! All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  One please. Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first? Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars!  Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss! <poem><i>I'm having a super fun time playin</i></poem> Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  <poem><i>''Super fun time, please don't go awahay.''</i></poem> <poem><i>No more worries or cares, super fun time.</i></poem>  Oh man, whoa! Yeheah, we're wired up!  <poem><i>You make my life so right, super fun time.</i></poem> Aw, just a few more things. Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on.  Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village. Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.  Crap, they called the cops on us. They must have realized we left. Damn.  Shhh! Butters! Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this! Butters, l-listen to me, listen. All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along. If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand. Butters? All right, come on!  Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free. Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Go easy. Good. It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP. Save me! ... Oh dude, laaame. Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go! Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump! Ready? Go!  Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters? Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm. Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome. What'd we do? We've been here the whole time. Butters. Jesus Christ!  AAAAH!   No! No!  Damn it no! No! Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me!  They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America!  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?  There you are, Butters! Butters, I need your help. The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care! I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now. You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents! Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?  So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!  You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese. All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready? This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country! Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull. Fruttar sheshar.  Do you see them? Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out. They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Oh, herro, prease, herro. So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves. Ting ton teetong. Yeah,  All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?! Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran. What day is American invasion again? I fohget.   ...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull. Oh my God... Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Hold the gun on them Butters! They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me! Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese! Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive! Shoot him, Butters! You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it! Aw dude, you shot him in the dick. That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.  It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just ''weak''. I can't believe you, Butters. Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!   Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  Don't come any closer! We have information that we will only trust with the President of the United States! No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters!  Dude! What the fuck are you doing?! God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?! What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick! ...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it! No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?! Good! Did you kill him?  Dude... Dude!   You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man. I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front. I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  She said it again.   Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom? Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy! I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison. Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today! Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Not at all.  "Wendy, we're gonna get you, Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!" Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy? Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?  You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.  Whassup? Standing right here, let's go, bitch. You're gonna fight me after school? You're a chick, dude.  Oh, it's on, bitch! She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it. Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass.  Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?  Wendy, I want to apologize, and, um, tell you that-  I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.  Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh. Oh, Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.  Wendy. Wendy, psst. Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs. Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight, then I-  Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.  My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs. Eat my underwear?  Okay. Okay, Wendy, I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now. No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will. I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us. I'm committed to peace, Wendy.   There. Yeahm. So...  are we cool?  Yo, what's up dawg? Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk. You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours. Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch. Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken. You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well, Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone.", but she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man, you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.     Ahhh, sweet. What?! That's ridiculous! That's not why I did it.  Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that. Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.  Huh?  The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool.  Okay, Mommy. Mama, Mama. Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.  What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight. Why not? You chicken?  Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?! I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo. Told you guys.  What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?  Wendy, Wendy. Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard! Butters, get out of here!   Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you. Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time. Alright, fine Wendy! I'll fight you, you big bully!   That's not true! You're just saying that! You're all just saying that to make me feel better. Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you ''do'' think I'm cool.   Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls? What girl is gonna see your balls? Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.  Shut up already! I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  So? How much? Really? Are you sure?  Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys. Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro? Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday? Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.  And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig. Craig, don't be an asshole. And a one, and a two, and a-   Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey!  No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno! No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku] No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui! Ha!  And we're white. You're being extremely negative, Craig.  There's no talking to this guy. You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig. Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time. That's right. Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way.  What is it? Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants!  Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs? Dude, it's Craig! Well do you ''mind'' tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig? Yeah, it's coming from up there. Dude, that's awesome.  Dude, Craig, we should go back now.  Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around. Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up! That guy's an asshole! Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV?  Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude.  There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!  What the hell are they doing? Dude, girls are such fags.  This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys.  Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends. Ehhhhhhh.  I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on. ...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore.  You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class. Fuck you, Kyle!  Oh God, shut up! Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup! Oh that's good, that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice. No way dude. Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes." "Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."  "That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes." I told you guys. He's been watching ''High School Musical'' over and over again. You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson. That's a low blow, Stan.  <poem><i>But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.</i></poem> <poem><i>Don't stress about it or you just might faint.</i></poem> Aw man, you've got to be kidding me.  Goddamn Japs are everywhere. Oh, who just shot me?  Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs. All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are. Yeah, now get out of here. Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch! Butters?  Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey! Dude!  Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor! Yes. Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out. It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free! Oh, I thought you were a ''tough'' kid! You're not ''scared'' of hospitals, are you? Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either. It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals. Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor? What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out? Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey. That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins! I'm so proud of you, Eric. Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor. ...What!? Oh, my poor little baby! Oh God!  Oh no!  Oh, oh, my baby has HIV! Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started? Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.  Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?  Sweetiekins, are you all right?  No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you. Oh no, thank you so much for your time.  You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin.  You all right, sweetie? What's going on? Oh dear. No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus. Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry. During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke. We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream.   She's... alive. But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone? I don't want you making her upset.  All right.   Right, boys?! Well, I'll let you boys have your say.  Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now! Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now. She's dead. Thank you for coming, everyone.  Boys, please take a seat. Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV. All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay? All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about? What? Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?  Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?! That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology. You're sorry for what, Eric? That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.  Could we speak with you please? Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz. Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else?  Any other volunteers, perhaps? All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class. Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.  After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them. These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you. Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, ''Mister'' Garrison.   Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office. Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman. Oh no? Are you sure? I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor? I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you. And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  take everything. Do you understand? When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless! Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some. I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-  -but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction.  I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-  What's going on? Are we in trouble?  ...What? Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot. Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you? He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic. Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...  Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.  What did he do? Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?   Butters, don't be such a pussy. Oh no. Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids. I told you that would work! Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not? Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else. You do? We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her. Oh, thank God. We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry. Oh no!  Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself. Yeah, of course.  Jesus Christ! Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can. Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse. What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain! No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!  She doesn't have any lips! We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.  I know where. We want three tickets to the North Pole.  We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt.  Oh no.  Dude, they're never gonna let us through. It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon.  You doing okay, Ms. Spears?  Oh no!  Kyle, what the fuck is going on now? Sacrificed? For ''what''? All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough! No wait.  That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you? Yeah, this is not gonna work. Do you feel anything? What titties? Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes. Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today. Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed. Kenny, you home?  Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life. Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you. Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up. He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic. Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.  What the hell is he talking about? I'm sure glad that's over with.  You guys! Check it out.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life. What the hell kind of flowers are those? Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on! God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now! It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy.  What'd they say? This is going great! Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money. It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob. We're the ones you told to get Internet money. Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money! Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with. ...Yeah.  Dude, wanna do some math problems? Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things  What the hell? What? My Internet's not working either.  I'm getting on it first.  Kyle, I need to use your Internet What about Starbucks? They have free Internet. Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!  What's so funny about that?  All right! Eight fifty one. Hey! Mom! It's gotta be our turn soon. Dad? Ughh. Naw, I'm with Wendy. Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her. Sounds like police sirens. I don't know.  Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone? What?! Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!  This is not the time for that! Dude, do you understand what's going on here?!  Wait, you have guns here? Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?! I can't let them do it.  Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away.   Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich.. I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail. I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe. If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck? Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller? He done killed yer pahr. I know.  Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something? Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you've got to let this go. Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on. There was nothing we ''could'' do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there. How? You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.  God damn it. Let's get out of here! Come on! Oh God! I can't watch!  COME ON LET'S GO!  JUST RUN!!  Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do! Let's just go, Let's just go!   You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same. Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.  Indiana Jones! All right!   No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas! No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?!  Indy!  No, stop! Raape! You aren't alone.  We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you. Wh-why? Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him! But they raped Indiana Jones! So, what now? What? I guess so. What am I supposed to do about it?  What? Yeah? I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you.  Really? Dude, there's nothing I can do about it. Ugh, I'm glad that's over with. Dude, we ''never'' thought you were cool.  I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!  I gotta get home for dinner.  God! I'm outta here; see ya guys.  They're in London too? Where's dad? Why? Oh Jesus Christ!  You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night. So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs? Over two hundred bucks. Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, ''we'' could do that!  Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer. Yeah! Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars?  There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make ''bank''! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs. All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam! Ya see, Craig?  Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first.  This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?!  Come on, guys.  Jesus Christ! Hey, back off! Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute? No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian- Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us. This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band. We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money. We we speak English! Help you how? Kyle, calm down. One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic.  Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.  Yes! All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that? We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea! Guinea pigs?  Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government. None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?! Dude, what is this place?  Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice! Let's see what's in there. It might be a way out, Craig! You guys, look at this.  I know, a-and look.  And then the guinea pigs killing people.  Dude, Craig, what's goin' on? Let's head over this way, guys. Wow.  All right, let's go.  Wait, whattaya mean no? Dude, we we have to go check this out. 'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is. Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe! Craig, dude, wait up.  Hey look, there's something here. No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening be''cause'' you guys got ''rid'' of all the flute bands. Jesus Christ! No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother? Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint.  Jesus Christ...  Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here. Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!  Dad Dad, we have a problem. No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital. Dude, he's wasted.  Dad, what are you doing?!  Let go of my face, asshole! Why does that matter? So where's the other doctor?  Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired. What's ''High School Musical 1'' and ''2''? I have no idea.   Who the hell is that? Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out... Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made. I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it. All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.  Okay, good. But you didn't die? I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway. Stop.   Uh, Wendy? Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should. I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way. It is?  Really? What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it! No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit. Yeah, look, I-I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed. Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy. You don't like doing it? Basketball? Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!  Yes, you can. What's stopping you? No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want! When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.  Sweet. Aww! Hey kid, what happened?! I-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?! Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good. You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate. Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!  Ah, shit. You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it. I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake. You can rip on him, but you guys ''are'' hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little? That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we ''are'' at risk of becoming the unpopular kids Actually, this is ''High School Musical 2''. It has a dance-along part. Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not! Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical! Look, guys.  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you. <poem><i>Try to do what you wanna do!</i></poem> <poem><i>involves needing scissors and glue!</i></poem> Huh?  But the girls like singing and dancing. But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!. No, I'm on the Japanese side. Dude, what? What? Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?! Oh no.  Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard. Great benefit, Eric! Oh, uh-okay, it's clear. Okay, but... what are you going to do? I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly. I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?  Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true. Wow, you really know what you're doing.  Man... Aw, poor girl.  Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.    Not me! I'm a squirrel! I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice! It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are!   Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee. Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is. Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind!  There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken. Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out. Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy? Yippie! Aww, this one again?! Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings. Well, how do other people make money on the Internet? Aaah.   "What What (In The Butt)," sir. Uhhh a few hundred thousand? Me too! Are we gonna get tested on this?  Oww. Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis! Yeah, that ''must'' be his.  Huh? I understand.   No. No!  Do you see any Indians? Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone. Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble! Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus! I'm not lettin' go! No, Eric!  No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr! Well, that's ''your'' problem! Make that two!  We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do! What are you whoofelin' at?  Whoa!  Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back! No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left! We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways. Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true. What?! They called the cops?! Oh my God, the police are looking for us!  We're gonna get it now! You just got me busted forever!  No!  You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised.  No. Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now. Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere. That looks dangerous. Oh gosh in heaven. Whoa! I'm gonna fall!  I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it! Huh...  Let's do it! Yeah, it sure has. Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh... Been a hoot all right! Huh uh. Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here! No!  AAAAH! Teacher, my partner is back on the bus!  Lu lu lu I've got some splish-splash. Lu lu lu splish-splashin' more... Lu lu lu- Uhuh, Eric. Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent. The Chinese? Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad. Why are they gonna kill my parents? I don't want my parents to die. Well sure. Yeah,  fuck 'em. Well I thought it was pretty good. I'm scared, but I know my country needs me. But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans? Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.  Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.  What?  Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling. Yeah. Stay calm, Eric.  Herro, prease. Fing fong ting tong. Okay, okay. Huh, invasion pran. We're busted! Uh what do we do?? A gun? I don't want a gun, Eric! Oh jeez... No! Waah!  Huh? But I was just trying to stop him, and you said- Uhwhat? What? What happened?  Aw, I did it again?  Well okay, I'm sorry! They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun. Uh, not exactly. Well it's not where I aimed, honest. I seriously didn't mean it. What? Uh where are you going, Eric? By, by my, by myself? So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?  I don't wanna get killed by boobs. Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey, everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school. Yeah, heh.   Almost time.   Huh.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy. But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh, to get out of the fight. That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!". That way it won't matter if you get detention. Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here. Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?! She chickened out!  She's coming! She's coming! But Wendy's coming to fight you. All right!  Fuck him up, Wendy! Well, yeah. Hello, heh. We lost? Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad. Hey, you fellas wanna go see ''High School Musical 3'' tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again. Why that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody. Awww jeez, you're no fun.  Hey, you got the lead, Wendy.  No surprise there. It's Bridon.   Stan! Stan, we have a big problem. There's vampires in the school! Vampires. I've seen 'em. Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. Then Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!  But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything. Really? Do you think that's best? All right!   12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.  Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire. That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too. Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're-   Hwaaaahh! Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it! Oh no, what'd I do this time?  Oh jeez... I have no idea, sir. Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-It's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were- A well-organized pantry. Well, okay, but, Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-   I- I'm Butters. O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding! Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire. Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity. Yes! Yes, anything else? Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back. I have done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food. Yeah, I guess. Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school. Whoa. Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh.  I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father! You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable.  I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se.  Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it! I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna...   Ow. What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry. Hey Dad.  I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak. Dahhh.  Myah! Maybe not.  I want to help you. Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again. I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires.  Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic. They're putting an end to it!   I changed back! Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again! What's that, Dad? Uh oh. ''Aw, dang it![walks up the stairs to his room.]'' He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared. We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just- No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and- Cartman has HIV? Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV? ...No. Way. ...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute.   I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly. I do.  I'm sorry. I gotta go home.  Wagh. What? No?! What? No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  I'm gonna kill you, Cartman! Why do I have HIV?! What did you do?! Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?!  Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!    He gave me AIDS! He purposely infected me with his HIV virus! An apology?!  ...What?! A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!  There is no cure, you asshole! What hope?! You're lying! Magic Johnson? So what?!  You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox! Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him! NO!  Don't. Touch me.  Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.  What part of this is funny to you?!! What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!!  So shut the fuck up!!  Knock it off!! Right now!! This isn't funny!! At all!!  Yes!!! Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around? But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep? Dude. You sleep with money. Every night? Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...  Wugh. Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS! I'm still breaking your Xbox.  A hundred thousand dollars?  Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney. It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera. A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth! Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!  We uh, we have special permission? We did it guys! Ahall right! All right. Butters, go get next to her. All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters! How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard. Whew. Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute? Oh my God! Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable.  Oh, God, what have we done?!  Oh crap!  What?! Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now? Aw come on now, people!  Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her? Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station. Yes they are! I have an idea.  I'm not Britney Spears, all right?! Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for ''one minute''!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?  What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?! NO! You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?  Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?! Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here? Be a good boy? You know all about this? She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan! Corn harvest! You can get high from choking yourself?  You guys are wasting your time. Whoa!  Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down! Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering. Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore. Guys, have you seen Kenny? Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing. Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now. Kenny?  Kenny! Kenny, we need to have a serious talk. Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese!   We've gotta keep this away from him.  Yeah?  No.  All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend. I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life. Dad, will you just listen to me for a second? God!  Dad! Somebody's at the front door!   What? What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?! I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad? Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!  I have no idea.  And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history? Yeah.   Kenny? Kenny?! Guys, I'm really worried about my brother. You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass! There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike! Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike.  We totally think you should have more money. Huh? Well we don't really have that much money. The Internet? They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet. We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.   Hello? Wait we're working on it. Sir, we're doing everything we can. We don't want you to die. We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please? Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn. Okay, we did it. Here.  Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now. Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!  Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!  He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything! If they give you something small, will you end the strike? Can you act like you're giving him a lot? Ike. Ike!  It's over. Yeah. Here you go.  Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media. You're not the teacher, fatass. You're not an awesome teacher! The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it! Kenny's! Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you!  What? Ih it's not working. I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in. I have to get online before school. It's not working here? Where... ''is''... the Internet? Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that... I think... I know what's wrong. This is gonna suck. I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?  That guy is wearing a digital watch. Right. Except for it really isn't. What's that? Come on, this is serious!  What's the number to dial out? I got through. Hello, police? There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage! The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.  Sister, you don't know the half of it. Why aren't the cops coming in?  Will you shut up! I don't believe it. Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny! Stan?  Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore!  Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.  nothing!  Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!  And because we did nothing... they got away.  No... No!  No... No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape! We can't just leave! Aw it's horrible!  Somebody do something! They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!  Aw no... My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible. I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.  Stan? I love you too.  Did you see it? Indy deserved more than that! I know it's hard to think about, but you ''have'' to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel. It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore.  What? We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live. No, really. We've always thought you suck. I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream? Girls like shaved balls? I think Kenny likes it.  Two hundred dollars? ...Become a Peruvian flute band? But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments?   Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band! Gracias. This is awesome! God damn it! Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second? Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay! We just wanna go home. Look, we're ''from'' Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States. No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru!  You know I can't go there, Stan! That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they? This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru? Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here. Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed? And that makes sense to you? So we've gotta find another way out of here. Yeah. Stuff just happens. That's right! Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains. Hey, hey, look at this.  I don't know. It's old. Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band. Oh no way! Look!  That ''is'' Craig.  Hear that? It sounds like water. How do you do that? Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy. Yeah, what a dick! Dude, have you seen my parents?  He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine. Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won. What?! Oh my God!  Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it. Ike?  Oh crap Ike?  Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help. Hey, excuse me, but we need some help. No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter! We NEED a ride to the hospital! We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay.   E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention. Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help. What the hell?  Ike? What's ''High School Musical 3''? Are we the only ones here who are completely confused? They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend. I'm not doing it either. Kenny? I swear What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself. Aw man. You're not copying ''my'' homework, you lazy turd. What? Are you crazy? We promised each other we would never do that, remember? Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too. Well, I had to see it to believe it! We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you! You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals! <poem><i>Do what you want, don't have restraint.</i></poem> Where did everybody go? Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan?  Butters, there's no such thing as vampires.  Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease! Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay? M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it "The Choking Game", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay? Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay? Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad. Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day. M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please?  Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay?  Uh, "commend" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay? Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study.   Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!  Wendy? Eh, somebod - somebody call the principal!  With an inexperienced man as President, we ''do'' know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?! Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo? Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows. Just a minute to go in the first quarter.  M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in "<nowiki>x = y + 1</nowiki>". M'kay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen. M'kay, now right-click on menu item "Equate O" and type in "input y"? M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.  Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay. We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV.  With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman. Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit. I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman. , these two brave friends- These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys , here is... Jimmy Buffett! This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets. I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now.  It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett! Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again?  Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section.  Looks the same to me.  The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic. Yeah.  We can't help him now. And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen. I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same.  It didn't make any sense, Stan.  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow. ...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie? Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this? Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya. I'll bet she is! As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight.  Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early. Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ!  I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls. Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower. Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been? Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan? M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel.<poem><i>Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-</i></poem> All righty then. There you go. Feel better, p-pal?  <poem><i>School again.</i></poem> There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep? Oh, well there's a relief. No, why? Doctor, what are you saying? HIV? No, that's impossible! Kyle? Kyle! Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh?   Kids are doing this? Huh?   Don't lie to us, Kyle! Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict! What are you gonna do?  Gerald?! Don't touch me.  Oh my God. That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy. Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble. No, it isn't strep... ...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?  Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?  We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV. It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.  Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice? ...Oh... Why are they doing this?!  What do we do?  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything. I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school. And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End.  Oh boy here we go! You know, the sequel to ''High School Musical 1'' and ''2''. Who's the male lead? Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?!  M'kay! Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each. ...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats. Oh, you boys are  like that, huh? Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash? Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies? The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole? Take a number and wait with everyone else.  Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya. Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store. What do you mean "back then"? Don't forget, it's 1864. Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time. Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that- Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time. Yeppir!  Finally, a fella that talks some sense. Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is. Hey, what the hell are you doing?! AAAAAAAAAAAAH!  We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again? I'm so sorry. Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer. Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez. Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time.  You boys both have the virus? Are you sure? Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't.  Well, not at all. The pool is over there  is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all. Sure. Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom.  Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money. Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..? I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try! These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen.  Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.  The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing. Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look!  Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.  The cure for AIDS!  Get the media on the phone! We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly. All clear for procedure. He did it! My God. The HIV particles are receding!  Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether. Let's hope to Christ this works.  And they found the dead raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round in their closet.  Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it. Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!  Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure. I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky. Here it is, general. The Internet.  See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green. Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now! What is it? I've got Internet!  All right! Me too! Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS.  About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream. Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more. O ho ho, oh houch, that's ''gotta'' be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical "no top of the head" look? Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back. Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either.  And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here.  Oh yeah, a fax!! It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax! Oh! it says, "The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it." We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live! It's back? It's back!  Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo! Live, from Chicago, Illinois, it's Decision 2008. We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch!  Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news! It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news! Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards  It's Britney Wowtch! Next on FOX News!  It's the Terrance and Phillip Show.  Welcome to the televised broadcast of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies from Beijing.   This is CNN.  First question: How do you see yourself as different from your opponent? And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending? This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff. Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! ''This'' is what really matters!  Oh-oh boy, what's she done now? She's such a train wreck!  For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it. We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest. Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone.  An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.   Let's hear it for Gerald! And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway.  Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone. But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-   My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya? What?!   I know that, okay?!   Gerald. Please help us. Our house... It has no Internet.  We've got nothing! It's just gone.   Oh no you're not!  What?!  It's not working, Gerald. Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it! Right, Starbucks! No! Nobody's is! Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now. God, the whole neighborhood's affected.  Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store. How do you know?! Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!  Jesus, it's statewide. Jesus... we're all alone...  I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't.   Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop! You're right. We can't just sit here any longer. We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way. Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up! Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go. How. You won't have Internet.  Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet. Sure will be nice.  That's right. We need to get online. Come on, Stan, let's get some rest.  Everyone, wake up!  Do they have Internet here? Marsh. NetZero. So is there Internet here? Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet. Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia! Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way?  Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.  Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.  I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy! Three minutes would be plenty.  Ohhh. Yeah, how'd you know? I know, right? "Internet Porn Simulator"  Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  It's just not the same.  Well at least that part's like the Internet. Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Oh niice... Whoa...   Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!   It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me! Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost!  And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT    There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?  Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot.  There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?  Huh?  Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.  Ohhh this is good! Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday. What the hell was that?  Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here!  Get back to your room, Shelly!  What's going on? What are?! What did that?!  Oh my Gohhhd!  Startled. HAAA!   ARRRGH! I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Wave to the camera, Shelly. ''I don't know'' what to do. I'm so startled. Jesus, this thing is worldwide?  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd! Gotta get out! Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Ohhh! We've got to get out of town. Go through that way.  Oh Jesus!  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon? Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside.  Here we see a view from outside the bus. I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon.  All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters. That's a that's a, that's a new sound.  Go! Go go go go go!  Oh no! Oho oho.  Oh, my god!!  Whoa, that startled me! That was ''really'' startling! We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.  I'm so startled.  Oh God, what are we gonna dooo? You can't help him! No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid!  It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah!  It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys. I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside!  What is it? Oh no, I'm way too startled! Jesus, they can't kill it!  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly? Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday.   Yyeeaahh!!!!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it! Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!  He's so perfect and awesome! Yes I can! Yes I can!  Here comes the change everybody! WOOO!  This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can! I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers! WOOOO Obama! O ba ma! O ba ma! Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo! BOOOO!  What are you? A McCain voter? Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car!  O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama!   Wooo, change. Not anymore we don't; everything's different now. We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore. Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss!  Yeah, you know what? Fuck you!  You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole! It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can! Obama's not talkin' about you!  Uhh...  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!  Well, my opinion is that- Ron, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all.  Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground  When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused.  That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits!  Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe.  She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.  This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight. The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado , who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars. Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates. A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise!  Oooooh, ouch!  Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news. Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts. ...and spearchuckers. Join the club. Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals! Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs. You are? Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel. Hey, everything all right u-. Oh. Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs! I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it! But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo-  My boys? Really? Send them in.   You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?  You're never gonna leave me alone, are you? I've got a better idea. Yeah.  Guglo. Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her? Gogehah. Egeul-gageol Okel? Ohhh thoooo! Yehehahah, all right! NO!  Kenny! NOO!   There, just take a seat over there. Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter? Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself.  You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere. , you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past. Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues. Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?! All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine!  This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months. Kids do it because it's legal.  The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.  has already been asked to appear on Jimmy Kimmel and ''The Today Show''.  This is a shot of New York City where the... giant guinea pigs have also attacked. Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world. No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out. Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this. Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.  Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away. All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it. Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be "love elation". Sounds more like you're saying "love creation". E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L. Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway? She must be back at the train station; come on!   It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great. The kid is right. This has gone on too long. Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly.   Hey look! There she is!  All right, Brit, let's try it from the top.  Gah, she's so stupid. I know. She's really dumb, huh?   Yeah. And she's all fat, too. God, what a train wreck. She must be stoned again.  What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears!  Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby.  Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.  They say you are hiding cats.  She has nowhere else to go. But they will find her.  Eeeek! Eeeeeek! Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek! A little closer! Wha?! Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man. I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper. Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul! ''The way she fee-els. [Britney leans over, and another dancer stands her up again. She warbles some more] Love inside.'' ''Temporary. [Britney warbles some more. Two male dancers come by and turn her around so the camera can focus on her ass] So hot! [a few moments she gets a solo segment and four male dancers fawn over her]'' Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing. Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest. Goodbye, Scrambles.  Geow, my arm! MY ARM!  Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense. Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with ''that'' kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads.  The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation. Britney? Where'd she go? There she is!  Ooo, psych!  Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... ''has'' to die. What do you think all this effort has been for? It's not just the press. Everyone agrees. She ''must''... die. Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner. Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese. The President? ''Hetus. Alte omnebus. [the photographers begins to join in] Virtu e poquebus. [other adults join in this nonsensical Latin chant]'' Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole.  You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand. ''[begins chanting] Rectus. Hoc honebus'' Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town. Well nobody ''wants'' her to die, little boy. We all simply... ''need'' her to. Do you understand? In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die. All right, folks, let's finish this quickly.   Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice. We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladiator times. Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs. It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery an' then stoned them to death. Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch. All right, everyone's about here. Hey, where are we? This isn't right.  It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy. Killing our kids?  Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this! We have to protect our children from this, Sheila. Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast. I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park. With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again! Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please? Kyle, have you been getting high?! Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?! How long have you been on the cheese?! Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this! Now, Kyle! First thing is we've gotta dispose of this! I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it.   I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits! Hey everybody. Good to see you again.  Huh... how come? What?  Get out of here, kid! You're too young for this stuff! She's mine, you little asshole! I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife. And to the people of South Park.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain. And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real. Problem is, the more you go into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you.  Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at- The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Randy. What happened? Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do. No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night. But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little- Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car. Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there.  Get out of the way, Peterson!  How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?! We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet! It could be nationwide. No Internet... anywhere... Randy, where will you go? You don't know if there's any Internet in California.  What is it, Kyle? Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished! All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.  Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago. And harvest is coming soon. Come on, hurry up. Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!  Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek.   EEK! A penis! Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.  Oh my Gohhhd! Let us in now!    A penis? Where?  Here Davey.  他们在干什么啊？ What are they doing? Mornin' Bill.  Nice-lookin' corn. Mornin' Gil.  She's the daughter of a country singer, and the young girl has really taken the country by storm. Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus, though only fifteen years old, is already on her way to being a major superstar.  They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes. (All set.) (Woah.) (Hey cool! Check it out!) (Yeahhh!) (Okay!)  (Woop! Woo-hoo!) (What?)  (You fucking asshole!)  (What the fuck did you do that for?)  (Aww i was so close! You should have seen her titties.)  (The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!) (I almost... touched them.) (Hey! What the fuck are you doing?!) (What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)   (Victory! Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)  (No we don't, guys.) (I'm not ruining my life, okay? Will you guys just back the fuck off?)  (Ugh, okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.) (Woooooh! Woooooh!)  (No, fuck you! She's my girl!) (Get the fuck off of me!) (Yeah. I guess so.) (Me too.)  (Woo-hoo-hoo!) (Yeah, that was ''my'' idea.) (No, I'm partners with Craig)  (What? Hey, let go.) (No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.) (Give them the freaking door code!) (Damn.) ('Cause, dude, i'm gonna shave my balls.) (Because girls like shaved balls.) (Yes, they do.) (I don't know.)  (Woohoo!) (Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!) (Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.) (Because they're trying to take over the world?) (Yeah!)  (I think we're ''fucked''!) (Yeah. Totally.) (I fuckin' hate Craig!) (No way in hell I'm doing it.) (I swear too.) (Yeah.) (Yeah!) (Yeah, look at yourself, dude.) <poem><i>(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)</i></poem> I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits. Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds. Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage! There is... another suitor.  This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis!  Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy!  诶，我真的不知道。 I don't know. 'Scuse me, miss? These people won't leave us alone. You aren't Chinese. Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America. There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail! That means... they'll never be free to rape again.  We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long.  All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do? Get off the internet, Stanley, It's time for bed Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off! Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime. Now, Shelly!   Randy, off the Internet. No, mister, it's time for night-night. You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime.   Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open. What's the matter?  What did you say?  All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.  Shelly, give your brother his ticket back! Randy! Hey, time for dinner guys.  All right kids, dig in.  He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub. Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does. Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.  The news.  We're watching the news. Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone? None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing! Well then stop being an idiot and help! To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys. I'm just saying that your son has some problems a- Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!  Oh my God. Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.  Guinea pigs? Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do?  Go Randy, run!   Where do we go, Randy? Randy, run!  Randy, put down that c-!   Randy? Where are you going?  Randy!  What the hell are you doing? Those aren't guinea pigs. Can we get out through the highway? Randy, will you stop doing that?!  Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom!  What what what what?  Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!  Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!   Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald.  What is it, dear? A penis? Now darling, calm down. Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises.  Oh, it's just a little penis, darling. Your teacher's penis? Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like? Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out. Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working? Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report. It could come back. Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?  Oh God look! Get off the roof!  Look, I, I think we need to find a way out under the city. There's something over there! Oh, shut up!  It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead. Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu...  Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark.  I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone! I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya! All right, damn you! The children can come in! It's still here, ih... it's all still here. No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right. You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?! I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go! What keeps a family together, Butters?! That's right!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right! You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?! There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?!  Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister!  That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?! All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah! Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now! Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  Uhh, Bu-Butters? AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!  All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!  He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground. What? That's right son. There's only one thing I care about. Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?! Butters, you are grounded! It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more.  No! No! Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie.  Sorry, these are illegal. Got two here. Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya?   Just look at all these fine Canadians in ''your'' school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind? That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important? My fellow Canadians, for too long we have been pushed around, and ridiculed! Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding! Instead, Canada Appreciation Day was mocked worldwide!  That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike! Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together! What do you think it means?!  We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!  We want: more... money! Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money! Don't give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling! Are you gonna give Canada more money or not?!  Then you leave Canada no choice.  One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)!  Go home?! You can't leave the picket line! Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat! I'm not your buddih, friend! I'm not your guy, buddih! I'm not your friend, guy!  Don't you two understand anything?! You think striking is a joke?! You think it's something to ridicule?!  Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we have nothing?! What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later!  Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA. Oh you do, huh?!  All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh! Wwe got 'em! We did it!  All right, how much are you gonna give us? Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?! You listen to me, friend!  Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls. Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories. Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?! We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient! Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend! Well I'm not your buddih, guy! All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen. What? SCABS! How could you?!   You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.  You've got me over a barrel and you know it! You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood!  Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will ''never'' call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die. Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands.   Who the hell are you? Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?!  You little timewasters! Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it!  Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau. You... You do? You wanna negotiate?! Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job? We have won!  Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these...  These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course. My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history.  Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo!  Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance. Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect.  Eh?! What do you think you're doing?! You'll regret this day, friend! I'm not your buddih, guy!  I'm not your friend, buddih!  I'm not your guy, friend! Nothing!   Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off. Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk? Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow. All right, let's DO IT! No, it's true. We've always hated you.   What? ...Fine. ...Yeah. What do you guys want? You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?  You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.  "Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole."  Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys. Can we please just go home, sir? Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.  I'm being a dick? You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick? That would be great. Thank you. My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  Oh, that's awesome. This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better. That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world. Stuff just happens. You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world. You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money. "Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there." What? I have no idea. I don't know. No. I'm not following you guys any more. Why? Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is." I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore. It's easy. Watch.  No. ...Nope. Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it. I didn't say anything. Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See?  Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes. My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen. The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  Peru.  Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!  Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?! All right! Wow, that's such cultural music. You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!  Look at their little cheeks! THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A HOSPITAL! DON'T YOU GET IT?! It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh? Well how much did we get? Did you say strike?  Who are you to turn us away?! Canada, on strike.  What's the matter? No, don't. You're wasting your time. Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet! Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers. Very cultural, yes. You're going to deny them too? Canada, on strike. What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet? Let's go, huh. Okay, then I want their place. Can all just take a hike!  Ahhh, when you say "Canada is on strike", what exactly do you mean? Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike. Excuse me? Sure, why not? Who exactly are you to authorize this strike? The WGA? What exactly does Canada want? No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park.  Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize  Yeah! More money! Yeah! Give us Internet money!  Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike! How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!  Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate! We did it!  More money from where? A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that- I'm afraid we can't. "Honk if you support Canada" He- hey honey, watch this.  That's right; we're a very progressive couple. Well we've done ''our'' good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry. Carole, get down from there! I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it. It's a Guineasaurus Rex!   Oh, we're supporting unions. Yes.  Oh, that's fun! Oh really? Goodie!  Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.  Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit. But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic. Don't call me a rat, buddih! He's not your buddih, friend! Yeah, let's give it up, guy. Well I'm not your friend, buddih! Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars! We're setting you adrift, idiot! He's not your guy, friend! Oh? Does it run on electricity? Not as fat as your face! He's not your friend, guy! Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know? Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation. And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars! You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift! Maybe you can go live with the Danish! I'm not your friend, buddih! You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang "La Cucaracha" for Paul McCartney? La Cucaracha-  We want more! We want more!  Yah, you think this is funnih? Oh my. And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending. In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called "What What (In My Asshole)". And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money.  In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians. Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians? Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us. Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe. Nobody knows where Denmark is.  Chocolate Raaain.  So, how many people have seen your Internet video? Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire. I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain. I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches. You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby! You all wanna motherfuckin' die?!  Get ready for some chocolate pain, bitch!  Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?!  Hey, I know you. You're the "What What (In My Asshole)" kid. Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa.  And the Star Wars kid.  Oh please, Laughing Baby had four times as many views as you!  Hai Hayaaa! <poem>''Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha.''</poem> Haw!  NOOO!   Leave the panda alone! Leave her alone, I'm serious!  Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?! Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions! Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.  It's over?  Good-bye.  Boom, baby. We're not your buddih, guy! It's like, my whole life has just been one big ''screw-up'', you know?  I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I ''still feel'' like a man This sex change was a big mistake, okay?  I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.   What do you want? I'm trying to teach. Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You ''have'' a penis!   What? Holy Freaking Jesus. Doctor, what about a penis? No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me? I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I ''need'' a ''penis''. Mr. Garrison!  Wow! My penis looks great! How long before it's ready? Let me see if it feels right in my hand.  Whoa no! Mah penis!  Stop, penis! Come back here! Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis?  My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese.  What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?! Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere! Holy Crap!   You saw a penis?!  There it goes! Stop you! That's right. Short, and little fluffy ears. Think you got it, Mitch?  Wall come on!   Where is it?! Come on!   Crap! We've gotta go back around! There it is!  No! No! No we, we can find it!  You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis.  I guess it's true. What's that old saying? "If you love your penis, let it go..." And so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure. In other news tonight, a South Park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice. This picture of a mouse  genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest. But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses. Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop. Here's the mouse you saw on television.  Once the ear fully forms, it can be transplanted onto a person. Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina. You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work. All right.  All right, let's see what we can do. Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison. Sorry, Mister Garrison. Your DNA has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse. And so... here's your penis.  Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations. Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon. No! Don't open the-   Young man, word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking. We would like you to try your methods on one of our inner-city school classes.  These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?  Give me your attention! I'll give you my attention. All night long, Mrs. Miller.   You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher. This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit.  The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating. The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud.  The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100%  Sure.  Ohhhhhhhhhhh. "I mis-interpreted the rules." "I mis-interpreted the rules." "I mis-interpreted the rules."  "I mis-interpreted the rules!"  The answer to #27 is 5. "The answer to #28 is 14." <poem><i>Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat</i></poem> <poem><i>Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.</i></poem> <poem><i>East siiide, west siiide, east siiide...</i></poem> What the hell is thiiis? I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing! Don't let it get out of the lab!  Hey man, what the hell do you think you're doing?! Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along. Yeahhhh. Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you!  Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater! Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys. This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat. Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.  You cheated! Fuck you, man, you can't do that! I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it.  I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try. Uh, can we say something? We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez!  Sure thing, Mr. C. What is that?  Stephen! Stephen come quick! A penis is loose in our kitchen! Yes! It just ran across the floor! Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house! There! There, you see it? I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases.  AAAAAAAAH!!  What is that? Chris, what is that? Stephen! You don't know that, Stephen!  Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy. You just march on in there. Butters, what have you done to your hair?  What on Earth? Butters?  Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?   Stephen, what has happened to our boy? We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!  Man, what's the point?  There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it. No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong. That cheating is good? I don't know, Mr. C.  What is it? Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men.  Long whiskers or short? Fluffy ears, okay. I think so, sir. Is this pretty close?  Look, there!  There's not a chance now. There it is!  What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen?  ''Someone somewhere is loving me tonight<br />Looking at the same moon and seeing it so bright.'' ''Feelin' my despair'' ''Someone somewhere is feelin' my despair'' ''And this same moon is'' ''[together] making them think of that-.'' Monitor us in a private room?  Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all! Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man. Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!  There has to be a way to find out what's going on. Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul.  Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  Eric, partner with Butters. Hold Butters' hand, Eric!  Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?! All right, let's head in.  All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner! Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you.  Not me! Not me not me not me not me!  No, you got your door code, let us go! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Okay, children, let's all take our seats.   Eric, for the love of Jesus...  Eric, stop being offensive. And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle.  And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning. Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk? Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay, Eric, that's enough, you smartass! They're all over the place! They're really furry!  Guinea rats? What do you mean "guinea rats"? In the sewers? Can't be safe down there. We'll probably be dead by sunrise! Get out o'here! Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down! Does that mean... maybe we overreacted? All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.  Oh, you kids. ''[Stan buries his face in his hand]</i></poem> Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies.

They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it. It's back!  When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it. You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley? Haha. "Get online" he says. Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there?  I've got Internet. Name? Name? Service provider? All right, stay in line.  Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite. No. Please. Don't hurt me.  Please, can't you ask some other way? All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2   Yeah, they've got it here.  But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a ''little'' Internet.  Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully. What is that? Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day. Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do. Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon. No! No wait! I haven't entered the shipping information!

What's wrong with it?  My God.  All right! Let's do it!  Hahaha, thedancingkitty.com, heh, wum, I wonder what that is, hum?  "Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize!" hoh, ahaha, ha. Me too! No, wait, I I just clicked on the kitty. I got it.  No! It wasn't long enough! NOO! Psst. Hey! Over here!  You... happen to be looking for Internet porn? Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy. Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say "click". Give it a try.  Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card. Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get. So jack off. What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?! Get lost!

It's me. Amir. Your family came here too, huh? So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home. Okay, s-see ya.  Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there? When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome.  To 1864. Set 'em up!  These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we? Damn it Chad! This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich. Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye.  What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864.  A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing. Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone? If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West. Well, what a straaange contraption. Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'.  I'll say. Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots. Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office. All righty. Come on, storehand.  What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich.  You let out Murderin' Murphy? You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all. Ohhh, welcome, partner.  That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa. Y-y-yeah, I understand that. Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864. They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy!  We made it! Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys! Why howdy partners.  I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through? Oh jeez.  I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village.  OW. Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the-  OW. I... I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith.  Thanks, Stan. Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then. What's going on? Over here. This looks like an office. I can't get a dial tone.  They must be negotiating. Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on!   Where are you going, Stan? Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.   Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people! This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive! Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!  No, you aren't! What is your problem? Breast cancer isn't funny.  or I'll make you shut up! I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do! That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass! You think you're tough? I'll smack the shit out of you! After school! We fight after school! You got that?! That's right! As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And ''you'' better be there. You're gonna  What?! What? If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone! No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone. Yes, you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight! I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you! Get away from me!  What?! You really think that's gonna work on me?! You can't bribe your way out of this! No, you don't. You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear! That's right. Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?! You fucking suck so hard! What are you doing?!   Ew!  Oh my God! No!  You are so pathetic!  Yeah? What? No! You don't understand. He said horrible things. Mom, you don't- I'm not going to hurt you. Yes, sir.  You know I can't fight you! I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom! I can't!  God damn it!  You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop. Why?!  Why won't you just stop?! God!  No, ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight. Yes, ma'am. Ma'am?  My... parents said that if I fight-  Yes, ma'am! I don't care!  [''pants and looks back at Mr. Mackey]'' I'm finished!  <poem><i>stands up on the seat of her desk] East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. [some kids begin to snap their fingers</i></poem> <poem><i>We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair.</i></poem>   Hey Stan. What? Stan, that's ridiculous. I would never leave ''you'' for Bridon. No way. That's stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants.  Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together. You gave it up?  S-sorry, I'm sorry. Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns. Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store.  Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeño poppers! We lost them, we lost them! Close that gate!  Everyone down on the ground NOW! Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area.  Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination. Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building.  All right, good. Is that all of it?  Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan.  Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants! Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Orlich. Above ground? So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent. Damn pig cops! Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif-  Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies? NO!  Nine one one, what's your emergency? Taken hostage where? You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character? How did they find us?! All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage. Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here! A Burger King.  Come on you! Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it? That's true.  Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter! What did they rob, sir? Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em. Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir.  No. Don't forget we've got these too. The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted. Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft,  but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock. One more thing, Franz: I want my share of the take now. I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.  What's the matter, Orlich? Lose your sense of trust? Very well.  I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!  Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs! That's it!  One... two... Yes? Give us the code to that door and we can leave! I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die ''right now! [gets his gun ready]'' God damn it you people are fucking insane! Domino,  Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?  Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!  I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code! I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM!   Do you want to see a child die?!  What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?! God damn it! All right, that does it!  On the count of three this child dies! One! Two! Wha-what are you doing? Eighteen sixty four. Orlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us!  Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages!  They are coming in!  You're hurting my arm! In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all. Sector Bravo, no activity. We've got a chance. Hostages are clear!  Hostages are secure at the park entrance!  They got 'em. It's over. We found somebody.  We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office. Copy that. What's the code, over.  Get your hands behind your head! Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now!  Let go of each other! Do what I tell you! Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go! Now! Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail! They killed my pahr! Yeah.  I got you now, Pioneer Paul! We made it!  Whoa, that was great!  Yeah, that'd be great! Whoa, no, no! It's over.  Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day.  Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home.  Uh, can I help you? Uh yeah, why don't I seat you over here?  Your waitress will be right with you. Yes sir? Okay, why don't we go...  Hey there, Stan. All set to see my new adventure? No!  HOOOOOOOOO!  Hey. Hey!  NOOO!  Drop? Uh what do you guys want? We-eee!  Weee!  Weee! No...  Weee! Hawwww! Hawwww!  Well well hello there Indiana.  Oh yeah!  Hold him, Lucas! Come on!  Yeah! Well well, Indiana Jones.  There you go, Lucas! Dick him!  He's gonna do it right there! All right! All right Georgie! COME ON BIG GUY!  Now let's see you just drop them pants! Just take 'em right off. Them panties. Take 'em off.  Weeee! Squeal. Squeal louder. Weeee! Louder louder! Weeee! Louder! Get down there boy!  Get them britches down. Yes, sir! Come on, squeal! Weeeeee! Weeeeee!  Weeee! Heey, what, what the hell are you doin' here?!  You've got nothin' on us! Seven hundred million box office!  Yeah! Get his pants down! Get his pants down!   Heheh! He-he ain't goin' nowhere! Grab his hands, heh.  Don't say anything, just do it. And pull off that little ol' biddy. The shirt there, too.  Hm this is bullshit! This is stupid. I'm leaving!  Screw you! Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!  You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.  Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film. Yes I saw it, but I-  But I just try not to think about it. I don't know what I saw!  All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-  Hey leave him alone!  Nooo... Nohoho...  It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you. You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you. All right men, come on. We're going in. Go inside! Move!  Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out. We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the- Got who?  Hohhh, they got them.  Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas! I didn't see it.  No! I don't think anybody here saw it. Did you, Mitch?  Boys, we got 'em.  Spielberg and Lucas, they were... raping a Stormtrooper when the police broke in.  George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! We have a warrant for your arrest!  My God.   Weeee! Weeee! It's over its over.  I love you. I love you too.  Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school! Kick the shit out of him, Wendy! Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight? Come on, Wendy, kick his ass! She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now! And then I saw ''High School Musical 3'' again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo. <poem><i>As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.</i></poem>  He's already seen ''High School Musical 3'' over a hundred times. <poem><i>As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.</i></poem> Hey Bridon. They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in!  Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?  Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?  Really? Wow. Yaaay!  I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody. Not a cheat if you rank up.  Did she just call us emos? And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that, like, go against your jockey man code or something?   Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad. It's about freaking time.  What the hell are those kids doing? Are they trying to be Goth? So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us? Really. Do you guys even smoke?  Oh my God. All right, Count Fagula, you go do that.   What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths! More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on? ...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people. We aren't trying to be popular! Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes.  Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now.   Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes. It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening, I mean... why now? Whattaya mean? Does your mom know you took her car? Yeah, pull over here.  Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart. If we get the right packaging, we can just FedEx him somewhere far way. No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies. They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids! I bet they aren't even drinking coffee. Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. Freakin' vampires beat us. What are you talking about? Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open? How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh! Let's get to it.  You should probably get out of here.   She is pissed off.  So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend. Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends. No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice. Aren't you Mike Makowski? So lame. So... lame... Sooo lame!   We aren't vampires.  We aren't friends! Allison Mertz is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop. So we're back to that, are we? I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team. Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes. All right, this is probably good enough. What should we do with him?  What's that? You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked.  How about we send him to Transylvania? I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires. Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything. Yup. Fuck all of you. I ate my underwear!  Weh- Wendy? We need to talk to you, right now.  Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school? Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us?  Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that? Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him. Now, young lady! We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman. Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up? If there is any word of you fighting at school it is over for you, missy! Do you understand?! It really won't happen again. Here she comes!  Aw, man.  What?  Bridon Gueermo? Oh, he's such a dream! Shut up and fight!  Ohhhhh! <poem><i>Everyone is special in their own way</i></poem> Awww.  Awww.  <poem><i>And you know, we're together at school again.</i></poem> <poem><i>With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.</i></poem> <poem><i>Together at school again. What a special day.</i></poem> Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London!  Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands.  The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General? Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through. Senator?  As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained. Attention Peruvian flute bands We appreciate your cooperation and patience. Tomorrow you will be boarding ships... ...which will take you to Guantanamo Bay. There you will spend the rest of your lives. Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again! Well think about it, idiot! Where else would "Peruvian" flute bands come from?  The country is in the name! Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here!  Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all! Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us  unless they are stopped at the source!   The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes. Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band. Which tourist location were they playing at? Let me talk to you guys out here.  Well what do you think? I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid. Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had.  If they are the hybrid we're talking about,  then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.  All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home.  You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.  We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning. You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.  Oh? And what might that be?  Guinea pigs? You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that? I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't ''quite'' put the pieces together. Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere. }} What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay? Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?! That was an order!  I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo! And how are the efforts to contain all this going? Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke. All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu. Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?! Am I in charge or not?!  Wait here a minute.  What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me!  No! How did you get here?! Shoot them! They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained. I said shoot them! Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!   Arrrgh. Dargh, no!  this is a pan flute epidemic. Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape. An outdoor mall in Colorado. I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us. Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?  Sir? We've got a bigger problem. New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be...   Yes sir. How did you know? A pan-demic? Excuse me, but... aid other countries? With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves! Go, go!  One more over here!  Let's go! Get 'em out! Yeah. Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go! Thompson, can you come over here?  The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them. Protectors from what? What does that mean? Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained!  The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day.  The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect. Paul Paul, what do you see? Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say "furry"?   Atencione bandas de flauta Perú. Cooperacion y peciencia es apreciado. Mañana sera el embarque de barcos... ...que la lleva a viajar Guantanimo.| Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas. Gracias!  No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried. What is that supposed to mean?  Now wait just a minute! Oh my God You've checked with the police? Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything? Like every kid doesn't have some problems! This is ridiculous! That's not ridicul- Sir, good news! Looks like we did it. Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all!  Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people.  We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out. Hmm... Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme. A hybrid? Ah how is that possible? Sir? ...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands. Oh, a-hah. But S-sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help the- No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere. No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs. Peh-roo.  ¡Por favor! ¡No podemos ir! ¡Estamos aquí para proteger a ustedes! ["Please! We cannot go! We're here to protect you!"] ¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda! ["The furry death! The furry death!"] ¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda! ["The furry death! The furry death!"] Sí. [Yes.] Sí. No podemos ir. Si, protectores. ["Yes. We can't go. Yes, protectors."] They're saying something like, "You can't send us away. We are the protectors." I think he said, "the furry death"? Really welcome silence, Tom. There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace. The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the-  Jesus Christ!  There's, there's something else here, it's...  It's furry! It's very furry!  AAAAHHH!!  All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics.  Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here!  Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't-   Oh my God! Sir? You... You... knew this was going to happen. Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that? Sure. Hard part's over, right? Two hundred ten? So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top. I'm on it. I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here. I'm trying.  Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land. What are everywhere? Michaels, Harrison, anybody?  Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge. ...Yes, that was the order. Nope, not at all. You don't understand. The plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here. We don't have enough gas to fly any place. It's starting to look that way, yeah. This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit.  Ain't ''that'' a peach? And how do you like them apples? Oh my God. It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge. Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving. Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp! This ''is'' where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington? Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either. Look at that: no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru.  I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps. Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs. This is Connor in Washington. Jesus they're everywhere! ...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh. Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared.  More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions. We checked on Wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the Andes Mountains, here.  There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands. Uh, sir? Maybe we should look at it, sir. You're, you're some kind of monster. Guinea pirate!  And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe. Get away, there's bees everywhere!  It stung me! It stung me!  Uh, Machu Picchu, sir? The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it. Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there. Something's inside the store! Guinea rabbits! They're inside!  God they're everywhere! Help me!  Travis! No! It's a guinea bear! Kill me! What's he doing? Sir, ih-is everything all right? Shoot them? Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh.   Sir! Sir, we have a problem! The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell. Yes sir. It broke out of prison. }} What now?! My God, are you telling me..? If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.  It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America. Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him "Sparkles". Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can. Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest.  Senator McCain. Ohoh man that was ''perfect''!  You played it perfectly, there was no way. Always workin' the angles. The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars. Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built.  There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached. Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.  We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-  -we won't get caught. Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys? I'd like to see the Oval Office, please? I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.  I will need absolute privacy, is that understood? Thanks.  All right, McCain. I'm in. I'm already on it.  Boom baby. I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum. God she's awesome. Oh no.  Is there a problem, gentlemen? Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone? My wife?  Michelle, there's something I need to tell you. The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago. Did you catch that, Davis? Did you really not like pretending to be married? Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.  4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors. 4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew.  5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum. 5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs.  Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched.  5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus.  We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago.  Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye. I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot. Could have been I didn't make that flight.  What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while. Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?  Yes we can! No no! Noo nooo! Did you see? Our man is in!  We did it! Everything is going to be awesome now! I don't even know what to do now.  Looosers! Looosers! Looosers! Obama! OooooOOOOooo!  Yeah! Obama! Obama!  It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours. President Obama.   I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us. It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President. Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours. Actually, the hard part's just starting. Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever. My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history. Million. Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel,  A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum. You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on. And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours. Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian.  You find the escape tunnel? Hello Sarah, it's McCain. All right, here we go.   Hi, Michelle. Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay. Thank you very much. B, you can't be serious. I just looove happy endings. Uh Mr. President, over here! Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain? Congratulations! Great start, great job! Change! Great job, Mr. President! Great job, Obama! Boom, baby!  Yoohoo! Obama yeah, I can't believe it! O ba ma! O ba ma! Yes we can!  Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over! Come on, time to go home. Ey, put down my car!  No! No! Hey, stop it! ...party Obama! Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off! So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time?  No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that. Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond.  So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel. This all sounds very risky. There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you? Well friends, let us depart. Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember? I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle. And we are. Wha? Boom, baby! All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3. What? Barack Obama?   Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama? Good, sir. Right now?  Yes sir.  I got a hundred dollars.  Mr. Obama?  Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there? Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here. Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem. The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office. They're all, they're all right through here, sir. Yehhheheah! Change. Change. Oh, hello Marsh. Huh? Hey, I voted for Obama. I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009.  Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but  Hello?  I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges. Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.  What's that noise? It's okay, just some construction outside.  Me too. Obama hasn't been elected four hours and already the country's going to hell!   Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing? Okay Barack, tell me what's going on? What is it?  Barack, what is it?! You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?  You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?! On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system! Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark. I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand? Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B. My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it. Go!  You're serious. Aww, what the fuck.  Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes. I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch. Hey you! Stop! What's ''High School Musical 1'' and... Dude, it's only ''the'' most popular thing with kids in our age group! We might have a chance at winning now.

He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me. Really? You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight.  Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'. No, Dad, can we just talk? Dad, I want to join the basketball team.  This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do. But Dad, it's what I really want. I know. That's kind of why I like it. It's my life, Dad! Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.  Look, I should be getting to class. I don't know... Okay. Thanks. Dad, I was just messin' around. Dad, stop! Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me. You're hurting my arm.  Yeah, great. Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-  No! I'm sick of singing! Just let me go.

Just... go easy on him, huh? If he wants to play ball, you should let him. He's just a kid. All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon? Give 'em hell!  What's so bad about hanging out with me? Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes! Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack. 'At's enough, you guys, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be- Hey guys. Hey guys!  The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball. No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does. Mister... Gueermo?  There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child? His name is Stan Marsh. Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son. Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly.  We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous. Oh my God! Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts. That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Looks totally badass. Oh, that's cool. Heh, yeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian. Yeah, we're cool, huh?  Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now. You can't, it's too close to Vampir.  Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire, in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se. Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se.  Ummm, what are you doing? That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se. Tommy Petros? Is he cool? All right.  We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se. That's Vampir Makowski now. Of course not. Smoking's bad for you. You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se. So? What? We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.  You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se? Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave. Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires.  Oh, oh no, are we in trouble? Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.  (Please, what do you want?! Let me go!) (No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!) (I'm not really a vampire.)  I'm gonna change my name to Vladimir. Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too. I want some Cheetos. You know that girl Bella in ''Twilight''? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like these sparkles I got? Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker! What is that kid doing? Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood? That kid was really scared of us. Yeah, he's cool enough. Yeah! Cool!  AAHHH! Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden? But they can't dress like that. That's our style. You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now! You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids. Get out of our space, you little twerps! It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it. I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire. Do I care? If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth. He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else. Leave us alone! Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village Inn from us too. Get away, douchebag. Well, I think we all know what has to be done. Yeah. You're not cool enough to be one of us. ''I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...''  Where did it go? Do you see where it went? Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something? It went this way?  See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated. This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.  Shit. Jesus.  Scottsdale. What the hell are they doing??
