Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind? God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of assholes on their Harley motorcycles show up?!  Piss off, you stupid assholes!   You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right? You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right? No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags.  But Cartman isn't letting up on him.  Agreed. Ni-nice, okay. What? I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.  Yeah, I think that'll be nice. I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy. That was us! Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right? Oh, they think we meant gay fags. Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard? You call them "bike-curious". Oh yeah, nice, Kenny.  Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country. Emmanuel Lewis, huh? No! That'll just make you bigger fags! Oh it's over, it's finally over!
