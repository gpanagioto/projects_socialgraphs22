BOYS! You are in CHURCH!  Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell.  Your ruler of pain and agony! A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ!   Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire!  Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess? Your  con- confession does not leave this box.  Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he ''would'' forgive you if he knew.  I... see. Okayokay, fine!  Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized? Then, hell awaits him. They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends! Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right? Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, "Depart from me, you curs√®d, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels." Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire. I hope to see ''all'' of you in church this Sunday. Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell ''do'' you go to hell for?! Whoa!  Son of a bitch!  Uhuh. Kids, uh. Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh.  Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you! M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell!
