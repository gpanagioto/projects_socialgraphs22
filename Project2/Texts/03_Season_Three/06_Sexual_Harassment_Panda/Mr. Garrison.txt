Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school. Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric? ...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Peetie, the Sexual Harassment Panda.  Say "hi" to Sexual Harassment Panda! No, I had no freakin' idea! Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment! I'm sorry, toots. Yes. Well, he ''is'' a little ass-sucker.  Okay, baby, I'm sorry. Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions?  Yes, Stan? Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits. Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun.   Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today.  Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president? Uh, Craig, how about you?  Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum... Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda.
