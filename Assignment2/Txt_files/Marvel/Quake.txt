==Fictional character biography==
Daisy Johnson is a superhuman with seismic ([[earthquake]]-producing) powers and is the illegitimate daughter of Calvin Zabo, the [[supervillain]] known as [[Mister Hyde (Marvel Comics)|Mister Hyde]]. Taken in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], she is under the careful eye of its longtime executive director, [[Nick Fury]], even after the latter's defection from the agency during the events of the ''Secret War'' series. Daisy herself is a participant in this incident, where Fury uses trickery, lies and outright brainwashing in order to secure a superhero team to overthrow the legitimate government of [[Latveria]]. This later results in a terror attack on American soil; Daisy destroys the cyborg leader.<ref>"Secret Wars" #1–5 (Feb. 2004 – Dec. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> She possesses a "Level 10" security clearance, the only known agent aside from Fury and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] (Natasha Romanova) to do so.

In her most visible action, Johnson helps to defeat the powerful mutant leader [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] by inducing a vibration in his brain that makes him lose consciousness. This is during a three-way confrontation with the X-Men, Avengers and the "Collective"—a powered being carrying thousands of mutant energy signatures. Daisy states in this appearance that if she were to join the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], she would adopt the moniker "Quake".<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #20 (August 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Avengers splinter due to the events of the 2006–2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline and she is later seen reunited with Nick Fury, in disguise, who gives her new orders to recruit the descendants of various villains and heroes in order to assist him with the threat against the [[Skrull]]s in their [[Secret Invasion]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taking on the name Quake, she and her teammates attack the Skrulls during their invasion of Manhattan.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The team becomes a part of Fury's Secret Warriors, with Daisy acting as field leader of the Caterpillars.

While investigating [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s escape from the Raft, Johnson is drafted by [[Captain America]] into the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] under her superhero name Quake. She is tasked with tracking down how Osborn appeared via hologram in the middle of a supposedly secure press conference. After finding out that the Avengers had been captured by Hydra, she proceeds to rescue them single-handedly.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #19 (Jan. 2012)</ref> Daisy takes over as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when Nick Fury fully retires and [[Nick Fury Jr.|his son]] joins as an agent.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #6 (June 2012).

Island]]. Hill is promoted to Director in her place.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 1 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' series, Daisy later reveals to her father that she has uncovered the origin of her abilities: she is an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] whose genetic abilities were activated by her father's unstable DNA, rather than through [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigenesis]]. The nickname "Skye", Daisy's original name from the show, is also introduced to comics as Coulson's affectionate name for her, and she is redesigned with the likeness of [[Chloe Bennet]].<ref name="auto"/>

During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" event, Quake appears as a member of [[Force Works]]. Their mission takes them to the island of Lingares where they deal with some [[Deathlok]]s and [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]].<ref>''2020 Force Works'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to her Inhuman metabolism, Daisy Johnson possesses physical skills greater than the maximum potential attainable by humans, including superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes.

Daisy Johnson generates powerful waves of vibrations which can produce effects resembling those of earthquakes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Megan Nicole |date=2021-04-29 |title=Marvel: 10 Best Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D., Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-best-shield-agents-ranking/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> She is immune to any harmful effects of the vibrations.

She is also a superb hand-to-hand combatant, skilled all-around athlete, and excellent marksman. She was a leading espionage agent, adept at undercover assignments.<ref name="sceretfiles" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=10 More Characters We'd Like to See in Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Her training under Fury enables her to target her seismic waves with pinpoint accuracy, causing targeted objects to vibrate themselves apart, from the inside out. This is shown in her being able to prevent the detonation of an antimatter bomb implanted in the body of [[Lucia von Bardas]] by destroying its power supply, and exploding the heart of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] while in his chest, to halt an enraged attack on S.H.I.E.L.D.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Jonathan H. Kantor of ''[[CBR.com]]'' referred to Quake as one of the "best S.H.I.E.L.D. agents of all time," writing, "Daisy Johnson, aka Quake, is a relatively new member of the agency, but that doesn't mean she hasn't made an impact in her short time. She first appeared in 2004's ''Secret War'' #2 as an agent working under Nick Fury. She started out as an excellent marksman, talented fighter, and she was remarkably good at espionage before becoming an Inhuman. Her powers were activated thanks to her father's unstable DNA instead of the typical Terrigen Mist. She gained the ability to control vibrations, which could come in the form of small shakeups to massive earthquake-like tremors. Add those powers to her already impressive array of skills and her value to the organization is clear."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kantor |first=Jonathan H. |date=2019-07-07 |title=The 10 Best S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents Of All Time, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/shield-agents-all-time-ranked-comics/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Mark Ginocchio of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' stated, "Daisy Johnson might be the most important S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to be introduced by Marvel over the past decade. Also known as Quake, the character first appeared in 2004's Secret War series and has quickly ascended the ranks in terms of her role within the Marvel Universe. She was one of the main characters in the Secret Warriors series, acting as the leader of the Caterpillar team. She is later named director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when Nick Fury retires. Daisy is also one of only three characters in the Marvel U to possess the vaunted "Level 10" security clearance within S.H.I.E.L.D. In addition to her lofty S.H.I.E.L.D. status, Johnson possess some incredible powers, including the ability to generate vibrations that mimic that of an earthquake. She's also an excellent marksman and fighter. Given how critical the character has been to a number of Marvel events in recent years, it's a bit surprising she hasn't factored into its cinematic or television universe somehow."<ref>{{Cite web |title=10 More Characters We'd Like to See in Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

=== Volumes ===

==== ''Quake: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary'' ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Quake: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary'' #1 was the 83rd best selling comic book in September 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 100 Comics: September 2015 |url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/169716-Top-100-Comics-September-2015 |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=www.diamondcomics.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: September 2015 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2015/2015-09.html |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 300 Comics Actual--September 2015 |url=https://icv2.com/articles/markets/view/32774/top-300-comics-actual-september-2015 |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=icv2.com |language=en}}</ref>

Doug Zawisza of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''Quake: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary'' #1 "lively," asserting, "Daniel Warren Johnson's art has a gritty, indie comic vibe to it. The sketchier lines and drawn-in sounds effects like "THROW" and "POINT" boost the signal, infusing the panels with extra energy and helping underscore the storytelling in an undeniable manner. Nowhere does it all come together more than in the center spread as the Avengers wade into a sprawling slobberknocker of a battle against an A.I.M. cell. Jason Keith's unhindered colors fill the pages with reds and greens, yellows and blues and toner-draining blends of various other colors. A brilliant cerulean blue pervades the story, giving the sense of urgency through its vibrance, but providing serenity in the cool temperature it packs. The visuals are rounded out with letters from Cory Petit, who adds the occasional sound effect but truly masters the tone and timing within the word balloons, packing enough character into the dialogue to give the cross-section of readers and viewers a sense this story was written for or inspired by Bennet's portrayal. ''Quake: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary'' #1 could have been an inventory story or a tryout tale; instead, it's a fun character study that digs into the rationale of adding Daisy "Quake" Johnson to the Avengers. This isn't the most definitive or memorable Quake story ever, but Rosenberg, Kindlon, Johnson, Keith and Petit make it a fun adventure with just enough heart."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zawisza |first=Doug |date=2015-09-14 |title=Quake: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/quake-s-h-i-e-l-d-50th-anniversary-1/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Co-creator and editor-in-chief Tony Guerrero of ''[[ComicVine]]'' gave ''Quake: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary'' #1 a grade of 4 out of 5 stars, writing, "As Daisy isn't quite sure why she was put on this mission and hasn't been given full intel, we get to see what her take and reaction is with the almost legendary characters. This doesn't feel like a typical Avengers story and you can feel the tension between some characters such as how Tony Stark deals with having her on the mission. Adding to the feeling is Daniel Warren Johnson's art. There's a great mix in perspective that almost makes it feel like you're in the middle of the action in the story. Jason Keith's colors also complements the art with making the moody scenes even moodier. The action scenes have a great variety to them and, again, doesn't feel like a regular Avengers story. This may be a story set in the recent past but there's a fresh take to it. The S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary one-shots have been a welcomed treat. With the focus on different characters, it'd be great if this was a sign of things to come. With renewed interest in the Daisy Johnson character due to ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', it'd be a great time to see more solo action stories with the character. Matthew Rosenberg and Patrick Kindlon do a very nice job handling the dialogue for a character that doesn't normally associate with the Avengers. We've been seeing some minor tweaks and changes happening with characters associated with S.H.I.E.L.D. due to the television show but aside from that, we get a really good self-contained story."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Quake: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary Review |url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/reviews/quake-shield-50th-anniversary/1900-4217/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=Comic Vine |language=en}}</ref>
