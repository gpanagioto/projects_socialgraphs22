  I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill! And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II! And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive! Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell! That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re- That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell! So now, what are we gonna do about it? That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite! ...Oh, right, this ''is'' the meeting.  All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime. Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around. God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides! Okay, all set?  Eh?  Go around. Go around, you moron! I ain't got one! You peckers took it! You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try! Stupid son of a- God damnit! Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch! Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve. Kiss my sagging ass! Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP! The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!  Yes? Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill. Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now! Isn't that a little extreme, Bill? The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now! All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station. We want our licenses back! Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back. Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile? That's right. I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families. Sure. I'll drive. 
Huh? 
There he is! There's my grandson! I'm proud of ya, Billy. 
. That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds. Six thousand dollars. It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so. Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?  Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all. Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy...  Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?  Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend. Oh, for me?  Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing? I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck. That's a good idea.  
 Ah, go away. What are you talkin' about? It's fun. Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!  Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop. Well okay, good idea.  
This chicken tastes like shit. What'd you do to it? 
 Finally you're here to visit. Did you bring Grandpa a present? Awww, Merry Wanderer  These Hummels suck! It's okay, Billy. I'm just gonna need you to deliver another one of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows. You don't understand how it works in here. Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch. You do what she says, or you pay the price.  Shhh, quiet. They'll hear you! What do you want me to do, Billy? You see Ms. McGullicutty over there?  Whoever has the best Hummel collection is top bitch in this place, and she's got the best. She's ruthless, and she has those old lady farts. You know old lady farts, right? Where they're so loose they don't even acknowledge they happened? Oh, Ms. McGullicutty. How are you feeling today? Oh, yeah, here, I I just got it, huh. Here you go.  That's my grandson, uh he he's worthless. I told you, she has all the pull in here. You go against what she says, you end up in solitaire. You finally come to visit and leave after 10 minutes?  Oh, Ms. McGullicutty, heh heh. How are you? I'm giving you Hummels. What's it matter where they came from?  Billy. What are you doin' here? Heh.  Billy, Mrs. McGullicutty's Hummel collection. You got it for me. Yeah. I just might be able to. I told you, Billy. These Hummels hold a special power with old people.  Go on, get out of here. Yeah. I think it will.   Now you know how we do shit in the nursing home. Thank you, Billy. Now if we could only take down the real douchebags who profit from all this. 
 Billy... What have I done? 
Oh, Billy.  My grandson come to visit. Billy, I have Alzheimer's. I don't even remember what happened this morning. Aw, great! Just tell the whole world, Margaret!  We had a right to be happy too, you know?! We didn't want to have to give the demon his stuff back! All our cars , and premium boutique ice cream.  This creature shows up, and it seemed like a good deal for everyone in town.  Aw Billy, it's not that simple. We thought about it. But our town was so tiny back then. We just, we wanted nice things other people had. I didn't think I'd have grandkids. I didn't even want children. That's why I always came on Gram Gram's tits. But then, one night, I'm having sex with your grandma, and she sticks her finger in my ass. She had sometimes licked my ass before,  I pulled out and your grandma was like "Did you just come in me?", and I was like "Well, you stuck your finger in my ass." And that's basically why you're here, Billy. I'm just saying that I wasn't thinking about the future because your father was supposed to be nothing but dried-up crust on Gram Gram's titties. It doesn't matter, Billy. It's too late now.  Everyone's greedy!  Yeah, I thought so.  
Hey there, Billy! Still gotta wear that mask, huh? We're all vaccinated now. I'm gonna go out to the bars and get some pussy! Have fun social distancing, loser!
