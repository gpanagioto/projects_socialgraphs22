The '''Man-Thing''' ('''Dr. Theodore''' "'''Ted'''" '''Sallis''')<ref>{{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|ɪ|s}}</ref> is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writers [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gray Morrow]], the character first appeared in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #1 (May 1971),<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=231}}</ref> and went on to be featured in various titles and in his own series, including ''[[Adventure into Fear]]''.

[[Steve Gerber]]'s 39-issue run on the series<ref>Gerber's run is continuous from ''Fear'' #11-19, and ''Man-Thing'' #1-22, as well as the concurrent ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1-5, and ''Monsters Unleashed'' #8-9, and these were followed quickly by a story in ''The Rampaging Hulk'' #7 for a total of 39 issues. In addition, Gerber also wrote the Man-Thing as a guest-starring character into ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #1, ''Daredevil'' #113-114 and ''Iron Man'' Annual #3.</ref> is considered to be a [[Cult following|cult classic]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cooke |first1=Jon B. |title=Swampmen: Muck-Monsters and Their Makers |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, NC |isbn=978-1-60549-057-1 |page=48}}</ref>

The Man-Thing is a large, slow-moving, [[Empathy|empathic]], [[humanoid]] [[List of swamp monsters|swamp monster]] living in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] near a [[Seminole]] [[Indian reservation|reservation]] and the fictitious town of [[Citrusville]] in Cypress County, Florida. Man-Thing appeared in the 2005 film ''[[Man-Thing (film)|Man-Thing]]'' played by [[Conan Stevens]], and will also appear in the 2022 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television special ''[[Werewolf by Night (TV special)|Werewolf by Night]]''.

==Publication history==
As described in the text featurette "The Story Behind the Scenes" in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d May 1971), the black-and-white adventure fantasy magazine in which the character debuted in an 11-page origin story, the Man-Thing was conceived in discussions between [[Marvel Comics]] editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer [[Roy Thomas]]. Together they created five possible origins for the character. Lee provided the name, which had previously been used for unrelated creatures in Marvel's early science-fiction/fantasy anthology ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #7 (Jan. 1960) and #81 (Sept. 1966),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15469 ''Tales of Suspense'' #7 (Jan. 1960)]: "I Fought the [[Molten Man-Thing]]!", writer unknown, at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronologyproject.com/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4073&sid=37aa7778a4232117321b5e4ac8a3eee3&p=25609#p25609 |title=Marvel Chronology Project • View topic – Man-Thing I |publisher=Chronologyproject.com |access-date=2012-04-12}}</ref> as well as the concept of the man losing sentience.

As Thomas recalled in 2002:
{{blockquote|Stan Lee called me in; it would've been late '70 or early '71. [...] He had a couple of sentences or so for the concept – I think it was mainly the notion of a guy working on some experimental drug or something for the government, his being accosted by spies, and getting fused with the swamp so that he becomes this creature. The creature itself sounds a lot like the [[Heap (comics)|Heap]], but neither of us mentioned that character at the time.... I didn't care much for the name 'Man-Thing', because we already had the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] [of the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]]], and I thought it would be confusing to also have another one called Man-Thing.<ref>Roy Thomas interview, ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' #81 (Oct. 2008), p. 20</ref>}}

Thomas worked out a detailed plot<ref>The three-page, single-spaced plot for the 11-page story is reprinted in ''Alter Ego'' #81 (Oct. 2008), pp. 22–23</ref>  and gave it to [[Gerry Conway]] to script. Thomas and Conway are credited as writers, with [[Gray Morrow]] as artist. A second story, written by [[Len Wein]] and drawn by [[Neal Adams]], was prepared at that time, but, upon ''Savage Tales''<nowiki>'</nowiki> cancellation after that single issue,<ref>The magazine was later revived, beginning with issue #2 (Oct. 1973)</ref> "took a year or two to see print", according to Thomas.<ref>Thomas interview, p. 21</ref> That occurred in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #12 (June 1972), in which the seven-page story was integrated in its entirety within the 21-page feature "[[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]]", starring Marvel's jungle-lord hero. This black-and-white interlude (with yellow highlighting) segued to the Man-Thing's introduction to color comics as Ka-Zar's antagonist-turned-ally in this and the following issue (both written by Thomas, with the first [[Penciler|penciled]] by [[John Buscema]] and the second by Buscema and [[Rich Buckler]]).

The Wein-written Man-Thing story appeared in between Wein's first<ref>The character Alexander "Alex" Olsen, introduced in DC's ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'' #92 (July 1971)</ref> and second<ref>The character Alexander "Alec" Holland, introduced in DC's ''Swamp Thing'' #1 (Nov. 1972)</ref> version of his [[DC Comics]] character the [[Swamp Thing]]. Wein was Conway's roommate at the time and as Thomas recalled in 2008,

{{blockquote|Gerry and I thought that, unconsciously, the origin in ''Swamp Thing'' #1 was a bit too similar to the origin of Man-Thing a year-and-a-half earlier. There was vague talk at the time around Marvel of legal action, but it was never really pursued. I don't know if any letters even changed hands between Marvel and DC. [...] We weren't happy with the situation over the ''Swamp Thing'' #1 origin, but we figured it was an accident. Gerry was rooming with Len at the time and tried to talk him into changing the Swamp Thing's origin. Len didn't see the similarities, so he went ahead with what he was going to do. The two characters [di]verged off after that origin, so it didn't make much difference, anyway.<ref>Thomas interview, p. 25</ref>}}

The Man-Thing received his own 10-page feature, again by Conway (with Morrow inking pencils by [[Howard Chaykin]]), in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #10 (Oct. 1972), sharing that anthology title with reprinted 1950s [[Horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy]] stories.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=157}}</ref> [[Steve Gerber]], who would become the Man-Thing's signature writer, succeeded Conway the following issue, with art by Rich Buckler (Mayerik began with issue #13). The feature expanded to 15 pages with #12 (art by [[Jim Starlin]]), became 16 pages two issues later and reached the then-standard 19-page length of Marvel [[superhero]] comics with issue #15, at which point the series also went from bi-monthly to monthly. In ''Fear''  #11 (Dec. 1972), p.&nbsp;11, Gerber created the series' narrative tagline, used in captions: "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!"

[[File:Man-Thing 1 (1974).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Man-Thing'' #1 (Jan. 1974). Cover art by [[Frank Brunner]].]]
After issue #19 (Dec. 1973), the Man-Thing received a solo title ''The Man-Thing'', which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974–Oct. 1975). Following Morrow, the main series' primary [[penciller]]s were, successively, [[Val Mayerik]], [[Mike Ploog]], John Buscema, and [[Jim Mooney]].

A sister publication was the larger, quarterly ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1-5 (Aug. 1974–Aug. 1975), which featured 1950s horror-fantasy and 1960s [[science fiction]]/monster reprints as back-up stories, with a two-part [[Howard the Duck]] co-feature added in the final two issues. The unintentional [[double entendre]] in this sister series' title has become a recurring joke among comics readers.<ref>As Thomas, for one, recalled: "''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' later had a decidedly funny ring to it, but not ''Man-Thing'' in itself". (Thomas interview, p. 21)</ref>

In the final issue (#22), writer Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming that he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on. Gerber continued to write Man-Thing guest appearances in other Marvel titles, as well as the serialized, eight-page Man-Thing feature in the omnibus series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #1-12 (Sept. 1988–Feb. 1989), and a supporting role in ''[[The Evolutionary War]]'', coming to the aid of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' Annual #4.</ref> Gerber also wrote a graphic novel that [[Kevin Nowlan]] spent many years illustrating, but he did not live to see it published.<ref name="lonely.geek.nz">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonely.geek.nz/fording_the_mainstream/man-thing/infernal.html|title=Man-Thing Web-Thing :: Graphic Novel-Thing|website=www.lonely.geek.nz}}</ref>

A second ''Man-Thing'' series ran 11 issues (Nov. 1979–Jan. 1981). Writer [[Michael Fleisher]] and penciller Mooney teamed for the first three issues, with the letters page of #3 noting that Fleisher's work had received a great deal of negative criticism and that he had been taken off the book. He was succeeded by, primarily, writer [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrators [[Don Perlin]] (breakdowns) and [[Bob Wiacek]] (finished pencils). Claremont's stories introduced the Man-Thing and [[Jennifer Kale]] to [[Doctor Strange]] (whose series he was concurrently writing), after which his material focused on two new supporting characters: John Daltry, Citrusville's new sheriff, and Bobbie Bannister, a formerly wealthy girl who is the only survivor when her parents' yacht is attacked. These characters' stories he resolved by tying them to a resolution for his own ''[[War Is Hell (comics)|War is Hell]]'' series.<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 2 #10-11, guest starring John Kowalski.</ref>

Black and white Man-Thing stories, and some color covers, also appeared in the Marvel magazine ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]'' as well.<ref name="unleashed">{{cite news |url= http://www.comicvine.com/monsters-unleashed-3-man-thing/4000-13808/ |title=Monsters Unleashed! #3 |work=[[Comic Vine]] |access-date=2015-03-03}}</ref>

[[Simon Jowett]] provided a Man-Thing story in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #164–168 (Early Oct.–Late Nov. 1994). The story was set soon after Sallis' transformation, yet depicted Sallis using a standard [[personal computer]] with up-to-date graphics rather than hard-copy files, an example of the [[floating timeline]] effect.

[[J.M. DeMatteis]] began writing the character in a backup story in ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2 #9 (March 1981), which opened with a fill-in by Dickie McKenzie.<!--He is credited as "Dickie" in the issue--> DeMatteis would go on to write Man-Thing stories in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'', ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'', and the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Daydreamers'', as well as ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #1-8 (Dec. 1997–July 1998), illustrated by [[Liam Sharp]]. The two would re-team for the Man-Thing feature in ''Strange Tales'' vol. 4 #1-2 (Sept.–Oct. 1998). Four issues were written, but #3 and 4 were never published. Their stories were summarized briefly in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]] Annual '99'', also by DeMatteis, with art by Sharp and others.<ref name=ebrandt>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/brandtellenmt.htm Ellen Brandt] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref><ref name=kadmon>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/spyrosad.htm K'Ad-Mon of the Fallen Stars] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/cleitoatlantismt.htm Cleito] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref>

In the 2000s, the Man-Thing has starred in a handful of stories appearing in [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and miniseries, including ''Marvel Knights Double Shot'' #2 (July 2002) by [[Ted McKeever]], and ''Legion of Monsters: Man-Thing'' #1 (May 2007) by [[Charlie Huston]] and [[Klaus Janson]].

In 2008, writer [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] retold Man-Thing's origin in ''[[Dead of Night (comics)|Dead of Night]] featuring the Man-Thing'' #1-4 (April–July 2008), from the [[Max (comics)|Marvel MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12531 Aguirre-Sacasa talks "Dead of Night featuring Man-Thing"], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 13, 2008</ref> This was followed by an eight-page story in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' (vol. 2) #12 (Oct. 2008), by writer Jai Nitz and artist Ben Stenbeck.

The Man-Thing appeared regularly during [[The Punisher]]'s ''[[Franken-Castle]]'' story arc and became a regular member of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' with issue #144.  The series was retitled ''Dark Avengers'' with #175, and the Man-Thing continued to appear as a regular character until issue #183. Steve Gerber's posthumous Man-Thing story "The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man", with art by [[Kevin Nowlan]], originally planned as a 1980s graphic novel before being left uncompleted by the artist,<ref name=bigwait>{{cite web | url = http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/09/the-next-big-wait-project-emerges-man-thing-by-gerber-and-nowlan/ | date = September 21, 2011 | first = Chris | last = Arrant | title = The Next Big-Wait Project Emerges: Man-Thing by Gerber and Nowlan | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | access-date = February 14, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101035505/http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/09/the-next-big-wait-project-emerges-man-thing-by-gerber-and-nowlan/ | archive-date=January 1, 2012 | url-status = live}}</ref> was revived in the 2010s and appeared as a three-issue miniseries cover-titled ''The Infernal Man-Thing'' (Early Sept.-Oct. 2012).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/66559/ ''Infernal Man-Thing''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> The story was a sequel to Gerber's "Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man" in ''Man-Thing'' #12 (Dec. 1974).<ref name=bigwait />

Author [[R.L. Stine]] made his comics debut with a five-issue ''Man-Thing'' miniseries in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gene Gustines |first=George |date=December 9, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/books/rl-stine-to-write-man-thing-series-for-marvel.html |title=R.L.

==Fictional character biography==
Young [[biochemist]] '''Dr. Theodore "Ted" Sallis''', a native of [[Omaha, Nebraska]],<ref>{{cite comic|title=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe#The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol. II (Deluxe Edition)|The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe (Deluxe Edition)]]|story=Man-Thing| volume = 2| issue = #8| date = July 1986| publisher = Marvel|page=p. 15|artist=[[Bret Blevins]]}}</ref> is working in the [[Everglades]] as part of Dr. Wilma Calvin's Project: Gladiator team, which includes Dr. [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Barbara Morse]] and her [[fiancé]] Dr. Paul Allen, and an assistant named Jim. A Dr. Wendell is later cited as being on the staff after Dr. Calvin is shot.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/calvin_wilma.htm Dr. Wilma Calvin] at the Appendix to the Marvel Universe</ref> The group is attempting to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum that had created [[Captain America]].<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 2 #1 (Nov. 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref> ''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #6 revealed that Sallis at one point treated and worked alongside [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curtis Connors]] shortly after Connors' arm was amputated, driving the research that would eventually transform Connors into the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].

Though warned that the technological terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.) has been operating in the area, Sallis breaches security by bringing with him his lover, [[Ellen Brandt]] (referred to here as "Miss Brandt", but later [[retcon]]ned to be his wife). He destroys his notes to his formula, which he has memorized. Later, he is ambushed by two thugs and learns that Brandt has betrayed him. Fleeing with the only sample of his serum, he injects himself with it in hopes of saving himself. However, he crashes his car into the swamp where scientific and, as ''Man-Thing'' #1 later explained, magical forces combine to instantly transform him into a slow-moving plant-matter creature with large, solid red eyes.<ref>They were yellow in ''Fear'' #10-13, but red in the ''Astonishing Tales'' issues, and all subsequent issues from ''Fear'' #14 onward.</ref> Unable to speak, and with dim memories, he attacks the ambushers and Brandt, burning and scarring part of her face with an acid that he now secretes in the presence of negative emotions. The Man-Thing then wanders away into the swamp.<ref name=origin>''Savage Tales'' #1 (May 1971) / ''Astonishing Tales'' #12 (June 1972); Wein/Adams segment. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sallis' mind was apparently extinguished, although on rare occasions he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form, as in ''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #41 (June 1980), ''The Defenders'' #98 (Aug. 1981), and ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' Annual '99,  and even to his human form, as in ''Adventure into Fear'' #13 (April 1973), ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #1 (Jan. 1974), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #164 (Oct. 1994), and ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #5 and 7-8 (April 1998, June–July 1998).

Under writer [[Steve Gerber]], the Man-Thing encounters the sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]], with whom he briefly shared a psychic link and who knew his true identity, in a story arc in ''Fear'' #11-13 – the final issue of which established that the swamp had mystical properties as the Nexus of Realities. Through an interdimensional portal in ''Fear'' #19, he meets [[Howard the Duck]], who becomes stranded in this reality. The Man-Thing became the guardian of the Nexus, and found himself facing demons, ghosts and time-traveling warriors, while continuing to encounter such non-supernatural antagonists as rapacious land developers, fascist vigilantes and common criminals. He formed a bond with young [[Radio personality|radio DJ]] [[Richard Rory]] and nurse Ruth Hart. Issue #12's "Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man", about an crazed writer named Brian Lazarus, spawned Gerber's posthumously published 2012 sequel, "The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man", in the three-issue miniseries ''The Infernal Man-Thing''.

In ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2 #1-11 (Nov. 1979–July 1981), writer [[Chris Claremont]] introduced himself as a character in the final issue, as Gerber had in the finale of the first series. Additionally, Claremont temporarily ''became'' the Man-Thing after being stabbed to death. His and other characters' deaths were later resolved with the intervention of the ''War Is Hell'' series lead, [[John Kowalski (comics)|John Kowalski]], now an aspect of Marvel Comics' manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. In ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #1-8 (Dec. 1997–July 1998), Ellen Brandt Sallis returns to the Citrusville area and encounters a little boy, Job Burke, who is actually the Sallises' son, who had been put up for adoption. Following this series, the story continued in ''Strange Tales'' vol. 4 #1-2, and was projected to continue in the unpublished issues #3-4. Summaries based on DeMatteis' unillustrated scripts appear on the K'Ad-mon and Ellen Brandt pages in ''Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe''.<ref name=ebrandt /><ref name=kadmon />

==Powers and abilities==
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2008}}
Though the beast now lacks a normal human intellect and has shed any desire to communicate with human society, it nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various [[Crime fiction|crime]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] scenarios.

In the pages of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|The Thunderbolts]]'', [[Dr. Henry Pym]] has expressed the view that the Man-Thing is sentient, though difficult to communicate with.<ref name="auto"/> For example, he once rescued an infant and left the child with a doctor (which would require an understanding of the function of a doctor and the ability to navigate to a specific address).<ref>As demonstrated in such issues as ''Fear'' #10, ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2 #9, and ''[[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]: The Return'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is shown to understand concepts such as how to ring a doorbell,<ref name="Fear #10">''Fear'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> how to put an arm in a sling,<ref>''Fear'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> and even how to flip an auto-destruct switch.<ref name="Astonishing Tales #13">''Astonishing Tales'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> The change in the Man-Thing's intellect can partly be explained by fact that its brain, sensory organs, and central nervous system are now organized in a completely different fashion than a human's; for instance, the Man-Thing's auditory receptors are in his forehead.<ref name="Fear #17">''Fear'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Regardless of what level of humanity the creature still possesses, it can discern when a person's motivations are evil, which causes it pain and motivates it to lash out.<ref>''Fear'' #12; ''Man-Thing'' #1, etc. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers that are derived from the combined interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of All Realities.

It is able to sense human emotions, and is enraged by fear and automatically secretes a powerful corrosive; anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be burned (either chemically or mystically), hence the series' tagline: "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!" Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, both for his monstrous appearance and the physical danger of his touch, typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands. Many survive being burned, notably Ellen Brandt,<ref>''Savage Tales'' #1, ''Monsters Unleashed'' #5, ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #1-8. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]<ref>''Nightcrawler'' vol. 3 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> (whom he does not even scar),<ref name="Nightcrawler vol. 3 #12">''Nightcrawler'' vol. 3 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Mongu, whose hand he permanently attaches to his axe,<ref name="Fear #14">''Fear'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> either due to intervention or dissipation. Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the "brain" cells located throughout his body. These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions. Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance. However, emotions that are often viewed as negative, such as violent emotions like anger, hatred, and fear, cause the Man-Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack. Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds. Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid. While the Man-Thing is devoid of violent emotions, his body produces a type of foamy, soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid.

Although the Man-Thing's superhuman strength, speed, intelligence, durability, and immortality, give the monster his powers it is his spiritual ability that makes him immune to any other disease, it has been established that the creature possesses physical stamina beyond the limitations of any human athlete. Initially, the Man-Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} but in later appearances, the Man-Thing possesses sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe-to-toe with much stronger villains.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He is able to lift a {{cvt|2,000|lb|sigfig=2}} automobile when sufficiently motivated.<ref name="Man-Thing #1">''Man-Thing'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Man-Thing's body is practically invulnerable to harm. Because his body is not entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body. Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing's body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation. The [[Devil-Slayer]] once sliced him nearly in half,<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> and he has survived being incinerated by a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]],<ref>''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' #1 / ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> although his healing from the latter has been the longest and most complex in his lifetime.<ref name=mtu4>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Due to the construction of his body, the Man-Thing is able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass through. The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side. This ability<ref>First demonstrated in ''Astonishing Tales'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> can be defeated mystically.<ref name="Fear #14"/>

The Man-Thing was once dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival; his body would slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or would be greatly damaged if exposed to clean water. His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plant<ref>''Man-Thing'' #17 (May 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp, as he became a self-contained ecosystem, feeding off of his own waste products.<ref>''Man-Thing'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> He generally leaves the swamp of his own accord only if he senses a mystical disturbance. The Man-Thing has also demonstrated himself susceptible to possession by other entities.<ref>''The Defenders'' #98; ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #4; ''Strange Tales'' vol. 4 #1-2; ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' Annual '99. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Man-Thing and a host of alternate counterparts have undergone a couple of changes in form,<ref>''Weapon H'' #4 (June 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> like having the ability to control and alternate plant matter both from its own person and the surrounding area.<ref>''Champions'' vol. 2 #22-23 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Man-Thing also has trans-reality shifting abilities due in part to his nature as a living extra-dimensional crossroads; he is able to open portals to and from alternate realities,<ref>''Champions'' vol. 2 #27 (Feb. 2019). Marvel Comics.</ref> interact with different dimensional counterparts and even alternate the physical appearances of said doppelgangers with those of their prime universe iterations.<ref>''All-New Guardians of the Galaxy'' #12 (Dec. 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Fear Itself: Fearsome Four'' #1 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> Through his empathic abilities, the Man-Thing can grow more powerful by feeding on the fear of others, increasing his size and mass to titanic proportions during ''Fear Itself''.<ref>''Fear Itself: Fearsome Four'' #1-4 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although the Man-Thing lacks a normal human intellect, in his life as Ted Sallis, he possessed a Ph.D. in biochemistry.<ref>''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition]]'' #5 (Jan. 1991)</ref> Sallis is legally dead, but his identity is known to numerous living people, including Wilma Calvin, Ellen Brandt, Stephen Strange, [[Molecule Man|Owen Reece]], [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], [[Thog (comics)|Thog the Nether-Spawn]], Jennifer Kale, and anyone they may have told or written to about it. His identity as the Man-Thing could not be considered secret, but his existence is generally believed to be a hoax, and an obscure one at that.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name=mtu4 /> [[In-universe]], knowledge of his existence is rarely tied to the experiments of Sallis, as are speculations as to any human identity he may have had. Despite having appeared in Citrusville many times, many there still believe him to be a rumor.<ref>''Shadows & Light'' #2; ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other known Man-Things==
There were other known Man-Things in the comics besides Ted Sallis:

* In the pages of ''[[Savage Wolverine]]'' as part of the "[[Marvel NOW!]]" branding, a different Man-Thing appeared where it resided on a mysterious island somewhere in the Savage Land. [[Amadeus Cho]] confirmed that this Man-Thing is not Ted Sallis as it has been rooted on the island for a long time. The [[Neanderthal]]s on the island used the blood of this Man-Thing to resurrect [[Shanna the She-Devil]].<ref>''Savage Wolverine'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a bunch of Man-Things reside on the [[Battleworld]] domain of [[Weirdworld]] where they are found in the Forest of the Man-Things. The Man-Things encounter [[Arkon]] and [[Skull the Slayer]] after they fell into their area.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Man-Things are ruled over by the Swamp Queen of the Man-Things (the Earth-11234 version of [[Jennifer Kale]]) who is behind the rebellion against the Witch Queen [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]].<ref>''Weirdworld'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)#Warzones|Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars]]'' revealed the existence of the She-Man-Thing, a character that fought on the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s team in a bonus round of the [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]].<ref>''Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] had created a spawn of the Man-Thing as [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] has its abilities enhanced with the DNA of [[Groot]]. When [[Weapon H]] is in the [[Redwood National and State Parks|Redwood National Forest]], Dario orders Dr. Baines to unleash the spawn. Roxxon's Man-Thing attacks Clayton, who transforms into Weapon H. Eventually, Weapon H sets off the Man-Thing's immolation ability enough to start a forest fire. When in the presence of Sonia Sung and Dr. Ella Sterling, Weapon H used his power clap to defeat Roxxon's Man-Thing enough to put out the forest fire. This same Man-Thing was held in a cage with the Brood-infected human Blake in a Roxxon facility as they are freed by Weapon H.<ref>''Weapon H'' #3-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> When it was revealed that Roxxon had opened a portal to Weirdworld, the Man-Thing took his leave, as Blake claims that he will find a pond to settle in. When the Skrullduggers emerge from the portal and start attacking the nearby humans, the Man-Thing and Blake assist Weapon H in fighting them until it was discovered that the Skrullduggers are shapeshifters.<ref>''Weapon H'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Man-Thing secures the defeated Skrullduggers, he is later sent with Blake to keep more Skrullduggers from emerging from the portal. When Weapon H and Dario later check up on them, it was discovered that they had some help in defeating the Skrullduggers from [[Korg (comics)|Korg]].<ref>''Weapon H'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Man-Thing agreed to help in fighting the Skrullduggers, Blake asked him if he had a human form, which the Man-Thing does not respond to. As Weapon H leads the mission to Weirdworld, they are attacked by a tribe of blue-skinned humanoids called the Inaku, who blame them for breaking the Earth and allowing the Skrullduggers to take their queen.<ref>''Weapon H'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Weapon H got free and Titania knocked Protector Hara into the protective dome enough to damage it, the Man-Thing helps to fortify it as Korg and Titania are assigned to help the Man-Thing protect the Inaku village.<ref>''Weapon H'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Skrullduggers attack, the Man-Thing, Korg, and Titania assist the Inaku in defending their fortified village from the Skrullduggers, until they suddenly go in one direction.<ref>''Weapon H'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Man-Thing, Korg, and Titania find Weapon H with the Skrullduggers under Morgan le Fay's control, so they attack the Inaku village, as they recognize Morgan le Fay of Earth-15238 as their queen. When Morgan le Fay orders Protector Hara to assist Weapon H and the Skrullduggers in attacking those who were sent by Roxxon, the Man-Thing goes on the defense to protect his allies.<ref>''Weapon H'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Minotaur fights Morgan le Fay, the Man-Thing is among those who are evacuated through the portal. After Dario pays them the terms of their contract, Titania takes Blake, Korg, and the Man-Thing out to a burger joint down the street.<ref>''Weapon H'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* [[Xarus]] got a piece of the original Man-Thing to grow his own similar creature that was called the '''Boy-Thing'''. The Boy-Thing remained all of his time on Xarus' shoulder as he supplied him with sticks for him to use against the [[Vampires (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]. After Xarus was killed by [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], the latter took the Boy-Thing as his own.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #12-22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Comic book character spin-offs==
Dr. Barbara "Bobbi" Morse was introduced in the second Man-Thing story by Len Wein/Neal Adams, although because of publication delays, she was introduced in ''Astonishing Tales'' #6, with the Wein/Adams story presented as flashback. Morse became the costumed hero [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #95 and went on to become a prominent member of [[Avengers West Coast]], eventually sacrificing her life to save her husband, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint "Hawkeye" Barton]], from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #100</ref> Until recently, her spirit fought alongside Daimon Hellstrom to eliminate demons from his version of Hell;<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' Annual '00; ''Hellcat'' #1-3 (2000, miniseries). Marvel Comics.</ref> however, she has appeared alive during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' crossover event.{{Issue|date=March 2011}} At the end of ''Secret Invasion'', Mockingbird was revealed to be alive and had been one of the early captures of the Skrulls.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}  Morse has joined the New Avengers and has had adventures alongside Hawkeye.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

[[Jennifer Kale]] debuted in ''Adventure into Fear'' #11, which was the first story Steve Gerber wrote for Marvel after his initial tryout. She went on to appear in two team books, ''[[The Legion of Night]]'', created and written by Gerber and partially composed of several other Gerber-created supporting cast members such as Martin Gold and Dr. Katherine Reynolds, and Bronwyn Carlton and Bryan Walsh's ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' in which she teamed with [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana the Devil's Daughter]] and [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] under the tutelage of Doctor Strange.

Gerber introduced [[Howard the Duck]] in a Man-Thing story in ''Adventure into Fear'' #19. Howard, who was displaced from Duckworld, an alternate Earth of [[anthropomorphic]] ducks in another dimension, via the swamp's Nexus of Realities, later acquired his own series, which was written by Gerber for the first 27 issues.

The [[Foolkiller]], a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone that he considered foolish, was introduced in issue #3 of this series, bent on slaying [[disc jockey]] [[Richard Rory]], introduced in the previous issue. When Rory was serving time for trumped-up kidnapping charges, he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear. This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. Both Rory and this second Foolkiller, along with nurse Ruth Hart (who appeared in ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 1) #2-7) were supporting characters in Gerber's ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'', while [[David Anthony Kraft]] made Rory a potential [[love interest]] for the [[She-Hulk]]. A third version of the character, who was in [[Internet]] communication with the second, starred in Gerber's 1990 ''Foolkiller'' miniseries. A second series by Greg Hurwitz, featuring a fourth Foolkiller, appeared in 2008.

==Other versions==
===''The Adventures of the X-Men''===
In ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|The Adventures of the X-Men]]'', which is based on the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]]'' [[animated series]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Jean Grey]] are inadvertently teleported to the Man-Thing's swamp from the [[Mojoverse]]. The three battle [[D'Spayre]], who appears as a fake preacher trying to lead people up a suicide tower that is drawing energy out of the Nexus of All Realities. D'Spayre, working for the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]], is burned by the Man-Thing when he fears failure. After their defeat of D'Spayre, Jean makes a psychic link with the Man-Thing (which she had done earlier to learn his origin) and is imparted information that she believes is the most important thing in the world. Jean is forced to become the Phoenix once more, using the information obtained from the Man-Thing, destroys the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], and in doing so, ends the universe. However, one survivor is sent into the universe to come, [[Galactus]], thereby implying that the animation continuity takes place eons before the mainstream Marvel continuity.<ref>''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|The Adventures of the X-Men]]'' #11-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Mutant X''===

Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Earth-691===
''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' (vol. 2) #38 tells the story of what happened when [[Killraven]] stumbled across the Miami Museum of Cultural Development and became caught up in the projected dreams of an astronaut from the "Mars launch in 1999". During the hallucination, Killraven encountered distorted versions of numerous Marvel characters. Rather ambiguously, the awakened astronaut later described the figures as "all the heroes from my youth" but he also often referred to them as "myths". The only Marvel character that is definitely "real" in the projected nightmare is the Man-Thing, who appears as part of an actual memory of an encounter that the astronaut had with the creature in the Florida Everglades.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Earth-11234===
The Champions encounter a Man-Thing that lives in Mbali, [[Tanzania]].<ref>''Champions'' (vol. 2) #22.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Ultimate Marvel''===
The Ultimate Man-Thing, in the alternate-universe ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], is similar to his traditional counterpart in mainstream continuity. In his first appearance, he teamed with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up|Ultimate Marvel Team Up]]'' [[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up#Issue|#10]], unwittingly saving the superhero from the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].<ref>''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Additionally, in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #7, during a flashback that transformed [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and his colleagues into the [[Fantastic Four]], the Man-Thing is shown for a moment.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''What If''===
The second story in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-reality]] [[anthology]] comic book ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #26 (April 1981) asked, "What if the Man-Thing had Regained Ted Sallis' Brain?" Written by [[Steven Grant]], with art by [[penciller]] [[Herb Trimpe]] and [[inker]] [[Bob Wiacek]]. In the story, an alligator that Dr. Oheimer was working on became the new Man-Thing, while Sallis self-immolated at his own fear while fighting it.<ref>{{cite comic|title=What If|volume=1|issue=#26|date=April 1981|writer=Steven Grant| penciller =Herb Trimpe|inker=Bob Wiacek}}</ref>
