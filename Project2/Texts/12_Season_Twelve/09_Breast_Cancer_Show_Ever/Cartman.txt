She said it again.   Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom? Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy! I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison. Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today! Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Not at all.  "Wendy, we're gonna get you, Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!" Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy? Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?  You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.  Whassup? Standing right here, let's go, bitch. You're gonna fight me after school? You're a chick, dude.  Oh, it's on, bitch! She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it. Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass.  Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?  Wendy, I want to apologize, and, um, tell you that-  I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.  Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh. Oh, Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.  Wendy. Wendy, psst. Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs. Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight, then I-  Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.  My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs. Eat my underwear?  Okay. Okay, Wendy, I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now. No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will. I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us. I'm committed to peace, Wendy.   There. Yeahm. So...  are we cool?  Yo, what's up dawg? Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk. You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours. Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch. Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken. You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well, Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone.", but she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man, you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.     Ahhh, sweet. What?! That's ridiculous! That's not why I did it.  Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that. Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.  Huh?  The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool.  Okay, Mommy. Mama, Mama. Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.  What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight. Why not? You chicken?  Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?! I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo. Told you guys.  What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?  Wendy, Wendy. Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard! Butters, get out of here!   Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you. Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time. Alright, fine Wendy! I'll fight you, you big bully!   That's not true! You're just saying that! You're all just saying that to make me feel better. Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you ''do'' think I'm cool.
