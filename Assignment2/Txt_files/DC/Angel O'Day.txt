===Revivals===
The series has been revived twice. The first was by [[Phil Foglio]] in the [[1990s in comics|1990s]], where ''Angel and the Ape'' stuck true to its zany roots. In [[Phil Foglio]]'s [[1991 in comics|1991]] [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]], Angel is revealed to be the half-sister of the Dumb Bunny, a member of the super-heroic group the [[Inferior Five]], also created by Bridwell. Sam is changed, too; he is not only employed by "[[DC Comics|DZ Comics]]" as an artist, but is also the grandson of [[Gorilla Grodd]], a nemesis of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. As such, Sam has mental powers that he can use to make a limited number of people see him as a human being. However, a break in his concentration allows people to see him in his true form. This is in contrast to the original series, wherein people see Sam's true form but convince themselves he is simply an unusually ape-like human male, since it is "impossible" for there to be such a thing as a talking gorilla.

A second revival was made in early [[2001 in comics|2001]] under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint, with a vastly different take. The four-issue limited series was written by [[Howard Chaykin]] and [[David Tischman]], with art by [[Philip Bond]] and covers by [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]].

The two appeared in a one-page story in ''DC Holiday Special '09'', written and drawn by [[Andrew Pepoy]].

In 2011, "[[The New 52]]" rebooted the DC universe. Sam Simeon was a scientist at [[A.R.G.U.S.]] where he was paired with Dr. O'Day. An accident involving gorilla DNA from [[Gorilla City]] turned Sam into a humanoid gorilla. During the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline, Simeon fell under the control of [[Cheetah (character)|Cheetah]] who had him operate as '''Primeape'''.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>

In 2012, Angel and Sam appeared in a segment of the anthology title ''Joe Kubert Presents''.

Angel and Sam are briefly seen when they sense [[Dial H for Hero|Miguel Montez]] using the H-Dial for the first time.<ref>''Dial H for Hero'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>
