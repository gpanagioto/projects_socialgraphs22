Oh, Billy.  My grandson come to visit. Billy, I have Alzheimer's. I don't even remember what happened this morning. Aw, great! Just tell the whole world, Margaret!  We had a right to be happy too, you know?! We didn't want to have to give the demon his stuff back! All our cars , and premium boutique ice cream.  This creature shows up, and it seemed like a good deal for everyone in town.  Aw Billy, it's not that simple. We thought about it. But our town was so tiny back then. We just, we wanted nice things other people had. I didn't think I'd have grandkids. I didn't even want children. That's why I always came on Gram Gram's tits. But then, one night, I'm having sex with your grandma, and she sticks her finger in my ass. She had sometimes licked my ass before,  I pulled out and your grandma was like "Did you just come in me?", and I was like "Well, you stuck your finger in my ass." And that's basically why you're here, Billy. I'm just saying that I wasn't thinking about the future because your father was supposed to be nothing but dried-up crust on Gram Gram's titties. It doesn't matter, Billy. It's too late now.  Everyone's greedy!  Yeah, I thought so.
