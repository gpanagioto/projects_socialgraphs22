 And here they are, the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the Wacky Races, competing for the title of the future of transportation. Cars are approaching the starting line. First off is the Lyft car  And this live coverage of the event will be broadcast all morning, of course, on CNN. As the Wacky Racers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear.  And Elon Musk's Tesla appears to take the lead. The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey. And look at this! The Lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger.  Now the Lyft car must take the passenger to her destination, but look at this! The Hummer salesman is running the Lyft car off the road! And the Hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself! Elon Musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the Hummer out of commission for good.  The passenger is being taken to the Tesla D now.  With the race neearly over, it's taxi out in front followed by self-driving car, and then pulling up in third is Handicar! It's gonna be a close one! Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again. And there's Handicar to pick Miss Applegate up.  We're near the finish line; the race is almost over. Handicar is in the lead, still way out in front of the ZipCar driven by Matthew McConaughey.  Dastardly car is racing past both.  Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside. And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it!
