'''Scarlet Scarab''' is the name of two fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

[[May Calamawy]] stars as '''[[Layla El-Faouly]]''' in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]'' (2022), with the character becoming the Scarlet Scarab in its final episode.

==Publication history==
The first Scarlet Scarab first appeared in ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #23 (December 1977), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], and [[Frank Robbins]]. The character also appeared in ''The Invaders'' #25 (February 1978).

The second Scarlet Scarab first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #326 (December 1982), and was created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Alan Kupperberg]]. He received an entry in the original ''The [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #9.

According to Roy Thomas, the Scarlet Scarab, like the [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]] in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'', was an homage to the Dan Garret incarnation of the [[Blue Beetle]] "about whom I had written my second professional comics story back in 1965.<ref name="Alter Ego"/> The magician and warrior who created the Ruby Scarab were named Garret and Dann.

==Fictional character biography==
===Abdul Faoul===
Abdul Faoul was a famous archaeologist during [[World War II]]. He unearthed the Ruby Scarab, an artifact that was originally created to battle the [[Elementals (Marvel Comics)|Elementals]], around 3500 B.C. When Dr. Faoul touched the mystical power-object, he became the Scarlet Scarab and became a champion of [[Egypt]] during World War II.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Dr. Faoul worked as a liaison between the Allied Forces and the Egyptian government, and led the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] and [[Namor]] to a recently excavated pyramid in search of the fanatic nationalist group, the Sons of the Scarab.  Faoul, who was actually the leader of the Sons of the Scarab, tricked the heroes into opening the vault where the fist-sized ruby was kept. As the Scarlet Scarab, he first ousted the British, and then the Nazis, from Egypt. Following the war, the Scarlet Scarab continued to battle criminals until one day in the 1950s, the ruby simply disappeared.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Dr. Faoul had not realized that the gem's crafter, a powerful pre-dynastic Egyptian sorcerer named Garret, had placed an enchantment on it that it would return to Garret's tomb whenever it had exhausted its store of mystical power. Faoul spent the next twenty years in search of the ruby, not realizing it had returned to where he had found it. Eventually, the Elementals sent [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]] to fetch the ruby. The ruby changed hands a number of times after N'Kantu recovered it, going from the [[Living Monolith]], a thief named Daniel "the Asp" Aspen, the Elementals, and an extra-dimensional traveler named [[Hecate (Marvel Comics)|Hecate]],<ref name="Supernatral Thrillers"/> before exhausting its power once again and returning to its tomb.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Meanwhile, Dr. Faoul continued searching until his death. As his dying act, he requested his son Mehemet to continue his quest.<ref name=Mehemet/>

===Mehemet Faoul===
Mehemet received from his father the strongbox in which he had kept the Ruby Scarab. Inside was the costume he had worn as the Scarlet Scarab, a journal of his exploits, and a photo of the ruby.  Mehemet considered it his duty to continue his father's quest, searching for years as his father had. Finally, Mehemet came to the gem's final resting place. Holding the ruby, he gained the powers of the Scarlet Scarab, and set out to become Egypt's new champion. One of his goals was the protection of Egypt's priceless ancient artifacts. In one mission to recover some stolen artifacts, the Scarlet Scarab encountered [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who mistook his intentions and the two fought to a standstill.<ref name=Mehemet/>

== Powers and abilities ==
Abdul and Mehemet have superhuman strength and durability, the ability to fly at high speeds, the ability to fire concussive bursts of mystical energy, and the ability to sap the power from others on contact. Abdul needed to maintain contact with the Scarab to use its power.<ref name=Abdul/>

[[May Calamawy]] stars in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]'' (2022) as '''[[Layla El-Faouly]]''', an archaeologist and adventurer who is [[Marc Spector (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Marc Spector]]'s wife.<ref name="D23Characters"/><ref name="GizmodoEp2Recap"/> El-Faouly's backstory is based on [[Marlene Alraune]], Spector's wife in the comics, who was changed from Caucasian to Egyptian at the suggestion of lead director [[Mohamed Diab]], and is also the daughter of an archaeologist murdered by one of Spector's associates.<ref name="VarietyMar2022"/><ref name="CalamawyElle"/><ref name="SlaterLayla"/><ref name="LATimesEp2Interview"/> El-Faouly becomes the Scarlet Scarab in the sixth episode, "[[Gods and Monsters (Moon Knight)|Gods and Monsters]]", after accepting to be the temporary avatar of the Egyptian goddess [[Taweret (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Taweret]],<ref name="CalamawyMarvelTaweret"/> with this name being confirmed by ''[[Marvel.com]]'' following the episode's release.<ref name=Marvel20220504/><ref name="DiabVarietyMay2022"/> Diab noted he had not connected her to that character from the comics, explaining, "Sometimes Marvel picks a name and then gives it to the character that is developed." He pointed out that at the moment, she did not receive her powers from the scarab, but ultimately felt what the character represented was more important than her name.<ref name="DiabVarietyMay2022"/>
