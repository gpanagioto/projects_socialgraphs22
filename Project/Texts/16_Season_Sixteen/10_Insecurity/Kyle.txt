Ike, what's the matter?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this? I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%- Oh no... You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do. Take a look.  Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man. Yeah dude.  Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time. I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing. What? It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea. I know... What?! Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch! The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing! Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet. And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself.  Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you? Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  Mom? You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!  Dude, come down here! Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
