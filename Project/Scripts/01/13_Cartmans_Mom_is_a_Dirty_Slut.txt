+++++


The bus stop. Kenny, Kyle, and Stan are waiting for the bus

Stan

Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.

Kyle

Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong

Kenny

(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.)

+++++


The three laugh.

Kyle

Yeah.

Stan

Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.

+++++


The bus pulls up.

Ms. Crabtree

Come on, we're running late!

Stan

We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!

Ms. Crabtree

What did you say?!

Stan

I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.

Ms. Crabtree

Oh. Alright, then.

+++++


She closes the door and drives away.

Kyle

Whoa, dude.

Stan

I always wondered if that would work.

+++++


The boys approach Cartman's house. Kyle rings the bell.

Liane

Hello, boys.

Kyle

Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass [Mitt to mouth.] I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.

Liane

Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.

Stan

In the backyard?

+++++


In the backyard. A classical piece plays as the camera looks at the picnic table left over from Cartman's birthday. Cartman is at table surrounded by four dolls: he is hosting a tea party. Think Mr. Hat, then the Mad Hatter...

Cartman

Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?

Polly

Yes, Eric, I would like some tea. Thank you.

Cartman

You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.

+++++


The boys pop up over some bushes and look at Cartman from a distance.

Cartman

Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?

Clyde

Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?

Cartman

Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.

Polly

You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody likes you.

Cartman

Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. [Sips.]

Stan

[Behind the bushes with the others.] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Kenny

(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.)

Kyle

Come on! Let's go make fun of him!

Stan

No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.

Kyle

Really?

Peter

[Back at table.] We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea.

Cartman

Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.

Polly

Eric is the best!

Clyde

Hooray for Eric!

Peter

Eric kicks ass!

+++++


At school, the Counselor's office. The boy who saw the counselor in December is back, but then, so is Kyle.

Kyle

Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.

Mr. Mackey

Oh, well, there's a news flash!

Stan

Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.

Kyle

Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.

Mr. Mackey

Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay?

Kyle

Woo-whataya mean?

Mr. Mackey

Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?

Stan

No.

Mr. Mackey

Well-obviously something is bothering him. [looks left] Oh, of course!

+++++


Mr. Mackey walks over to a shelf.

Mr. Mackey

My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay?

Stan

Is that legal?

Mr. Mackey

Oh, hell yes!

+++++


Back at Cartman's Tea Party.

Cartman

My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.

Polly

Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true.

Peter

Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much.

Cartman

That's niiice, Peter Panda.

+++++


Stan and Kyle are back at the bushes with Mr. Mackey's camera.

Stan

Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.

Kyle

How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?

Stan

I donnow, just keep rolling.

Cartman

More tea, Rumpertumskin?

Rumpertumskin

Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome.

Cartman

Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?

Clyde

I think you're a big fat piece of crap.

+++++


Cartman, confused of how to take that.

Cartman

Eeeyy!

+++++


Cartman's house, later that night. Cartman and his mom are dining when Mr. Kitty comes by.

Kitty

Meow.

Cartman

No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!

Kitty

Meow.

Cartman

No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!

Kitty

Hhhhhcck!

Liane

How is your beefy roast, snookums?

Cartman

Mom? Can I ask you a question?

Liane

Sure, hon.

Cartman

You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?

Liane

Uh huuuh.

Cartman

And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?

Liane

Yyeess??

+++++


They look at each other for a long time.

Liane

Well, what's your question, hon?

Cartman

God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!

Liane

Oooooohh.

Cartman

I want to know where I came from.

Liane

Ooohh, hhmmm [Finger to lips.]. Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other.

Cartman

Uh huuh.

Liane

And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.

+++++


Cartman and his mom look at each other, Kitty looks at them both.

Cartman

So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?

Liane

Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance.

+++++


A flashback sequence begins where a barn appears with a banner: 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance. Cows are standing around while music and light emanate from inside the barn.

Liane

I was young and naive then...

+++++


Liane is seen downing a very tall flask of beer.

Man

Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman.

Liane

Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he. [The band ends its tune.] I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! [She stands next to Barbrady.]

Trainee Barbrady

I wouldn't mind gettin' ahold of your cookies, Ms. Cartman!

Liane

[Breathlessly.] Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady.

Trainee Barbrady

[Takes a cookie and bites into it.] Mm, that's a good cookie! [The band resumes playing.]

Jimbo

Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!

+++++


A duck falls from the ceiling and everybody takes their bottles of beer and toast the occasion. They drop their empty bottles, and Ned ends up falling where he stands.

Liane

And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water. 

+++++


The crowd separates to reveal a handsome Indian entering the dance. A song begins.

Singing


There you are, like a throbbing star. I want you to make love to me.



+++++


Ms. Cartman and the Chief focus in on each other, then walk to each other, then bump into each other. Ms. Cartman falls, then gets up, vomits, and starts dancing with the Chief.

Liane

I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.

Cartman

So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?

Liane

Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.

Cartman

[Weighs the story.] That isn't a very romantic story, Mom.

Liane

I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.

Cartman

Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.

Kitty

Meow.

Cartman

No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!

+++++


Stan's house. Grandpa, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are watching TV.

Annoncer

Coming this Sunday, [Music begins to play.] a major television event that will blow you away. Terrance. Phillip.

+++++


The title screen appears.

Announcer

In the harrowing made-for-TV drama, Not Without My Anus, based on a true story.

Terrance

Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.

Phillip

Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance.

+++++


He farts. They both laugh, the music starts up again.

Annoncer

See Canada's hottest stars on the HBC movie of the week.

Stan

Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!

Kyle

Yeah, dude. It looks riveting.

+++++


Grandpa starts flipping channels.

Stan

Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.

Grandpa

No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show.

Stan

Aaawww.

Kyle

[At the same time.] Hunh?

Annoncer

And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos. Here is you host, Bob Saget!

Bob Saget

Hey, I just flew into the studio.

+++++


He flaps his right arm like he actually flew in.

Bob Saget

Boy are my arms tired. Heheh. Heh.

+++++


Grandpa laughs, but no one in the studio audience is.

Bob Saget

Wha, Why didn't the skeleton cross the road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts.

+++++


Only he and Grandpa laugh.

Bob Saget

Knock knock.

+++++


The audience stays silent.

Bob Saget

Bob.

+++++


Audience is silent.

Bob Saget

Bob Saget..

+++++


He chuckles to himself. As if on cue, the audience breaks into laughter and some members fall over. Grandpa falls over, too, and laughs his ass off for a minute or so.

Stan

This guy sucks!

+++++


The bell rings and he goes to answer it.

Kyle

Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.

+++++


Stan opens the door to find Cartman

Stan

Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?

Cartman

[Indian music plays.] Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people.

+++++


He's dressed in Indian clothes (including tassels), with a headband holding three feathers, and an eagle necklace, not a bear one.

Stan

What??

+++++


Kyle and Kenny reach the door, look at Cartman, and crack up.

Cartman

Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!

+++++


The boys are quiet.

Cartman

Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.

Stan

What are you talking about, Cartman?!

Cartman

My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?

Stan

Go ahead, dude.

+++++


Cartman turns left and leaves to get the bike. The other three return to the sofa to watch TV.

Kyle

Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.

Stan

Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!

Bob Saget

Just a free li'l reminder to all of you out there: send us your stupidest home videos. Grand prize for this month will be $10,000. [Chuckles.]

Grandpa

Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.

Kyle

Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video.

+++++


They realize that they do, then look at the videotape, and smile.

+++++


UTE Native American Reservation.

Chief Running Water

...And Bear cried to Eagle-

Indian 1

Running Water, there is some kid here to see you.

Chief Running Water

What kid?

Indian 1

He claims to be your kid.

+++++


Cartman squeezes his way into the campfire circle.

Cartman

Hiya, Dad!

Chief Running Water

Who the hell are you?

Cartman

I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.

Chief Running Water

Your mother?

Cartman

Liane Cartman.

Chief Running Water

Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second. [Suddenly serious.] Look, kid, I'm not your father.

Cartman

But my mom says you're the guy she was with.

Chief Running Water

Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'

Cartman

Whatooya mean?

Chief Running Water

She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'

Cartman

Huh??

Chief Running Water

Your mom's a slut.

+++++


The other Utes on either side of him nod in agreement.

Cartman

Eeyy!!

Chief Running Water

Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.

+++++


He flashes back to the 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance.

Chief Running Water

We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot.

Chief Running Water

There you are...

Chief Running Water

I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things.

Liane

Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.

Chief Running Water

Whoa, Helloooh!!

+++++


They start kissing. A man vomits and passes out.

Liane

[Interrupting the action.] Wait. Wait.

+++++


She looks towards the entrance, and the Chief rolls back.

Liane

] Who is that?

+++++


Some funk plays as Chef makes his entrance and waves hello to everyone. She looks at Chef.

Singing


There you are like a throbbing star-



+++++


Now these two focus in on each other.

Liane

Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?

Chief Running Water

Huh??

+++++


Liane gets up and leaves.

Chief Running Water

You gotta be kidding me.

Liane

[Approaching Chef.] Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. [Flirts with him gently.]

Chef

Nawh. I'm new in town.

Liane

Well, what's a nice, handsome, black [She looks at his crotch. He follows her gaze.] man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?

Chef

I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.

Liane

Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?

Chef

Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?

Liane

Ahah, I'm plastered! [Tongues come out and they start kissing.]

Cartman

[Alone with the Chief] His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??

Chief Running Water

He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.

Cartman

Oh my God! I'm a black African American!

+++++


Back in town, the following day. Kenny is trying to start a go-cart.

Stan

Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.

Kyle

Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?

Stan

Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.

Kyle

If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.

Stan

[With the right hand cupped to the side of his mouth.] Shhh! Here comes Cartman.

Cartman

[With rap beats playing now.] 'S up, homies?

+++++


He's dressed in a red jogging suit and white sneakers. He has a large clock hanging off his necklace and sports a high flat-top. On his right hand are some brass knuckles with the work 'PIE' grafted to them.

Stan

Cartman?!

Cartman

I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.

Kyle

You live on the Eastside, Cartman!

Stan

Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.

Cartman

[Aloofly.] Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.

+++++


Stan and Kyle just look at him.

Cartman

You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.

+++++


He starts to moonwalk away to the sound of scratchin'.

Stan

Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.

+++++


Kenny finally gets the go-cart going, but is yanked behind it. It won't let him go, and a variation on Mission Impossible begins to play.

Kenny

(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)

Stan, Kyle

Hold on, Kenny!

Kenny

(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-

+++++


He hits a bump on the road.

Kenny

(AARGH.)

+++++


The go-cart returns and goes into the snow.

Kenny

(Goddamn, why-)

+++++


He goes into a tight grove of trees, then exits.

Kenny

(Oh this freakin'-)

+++++


He hits a boulder.

Kenny

(AARGH.)

+++++


The go-cart lands upside down on some tracks. Kenny gets up and dusts himself off.

Kenny

(Phew.)

+++++


The guys look at him and he waves to them.

Kenny

(Well, I'm fine, guys!)

+++++


They smile and wave back.

Kenny

(Now if I can-)

+++++


A train strike him and the go-cart, obliterating both.

Stan

Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.

Kyle

You bastards!

+++++


Chef's house. Cartman arrives.

Chef

Hello?

Cartman

Yo, Pops!

Chef

[Studying...] Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?

Cartman

You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?

Chef

Get in here! [Drags him in.]

Cartman

Westsa-eed-eh.

+++++


Now in the living room with Cartman.

Chef

Take that wig off! [Does it himself.] What's gotten into you?!

Cartman

You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.

Chef

What?! Noh! Uh, did I?

Cartman

He said you kissed her with your tongue.

Chef

Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.

Cartman

[Dejected.] Huho. So you're not my dad?

Chef

Of course not. Here. You children sit down,

+++++


Chef props him up on a stool.

Chef

...and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.

When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen,
and the two take off their clothes,
that's right,
And they caress and touch each other,
until the part of the man grows,
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot,
And the man says "I love you" and the woman says "hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom"
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait...
[Pause.]
...and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says,
"Baby, I'm gettin' hot!"
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...



Cartman

What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!

Chef

Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember.

+++++


Back at the Drunken Barn Dance. Chef is kissing Liane on the hay stack.

Liane

Whoa, Chef! [He pulls away a bit.] You're so strong!

Jimbo

Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!

+++++


The barn door opens and the Broncos pour in. Most of them are "hutt-hutting".

Bronco 1

Are we late for the party?

Bronco 2

What the hell town is this?

Singing


There you are, like a throbbing star. I want-



Liane

Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!

Chef

Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!

Liane

Woooh! Whooppee!! [She throws her arms out in ecstasy.] Unhh!

+++++


A hand appears from under the hay. Chef grabs it and pulls the rest of the body up.

Chef

Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!

Mr. Garrison

You're drunk, Mr. Hat!

+++++


Mr. Garrison is rather pleased that he did quite a bit without getting caught. Liane now looks at Mr. Garrison.

Singing


There you are-



Chef

Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!

Liane

Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a menage o'three?

Chef

Yeah! When two women are involved. [Moves away.]

Mr. Garrison

Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman.

+++++


He moves quickly on top of her and starts kissing her.

Chef

And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!

Cartman

No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!

+++++


Stan's house that afternoon. He, Kyle, and Grandpa are once again looking at TV

Announcer

And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-

Bob Saget

Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.

Cartman

Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.

+++++


The audience is watching.

Polly

I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all.

+++++


The audience starts to laugh.

Cartman

Really? You don't think so?

Clyde

Naw, you're not fat.

Cartman

[Grabs a teacup.] Gee, that's kewl.

+++++


The audience is laughing harder. Stan and Kyle are laughing with the audience, and Stan's parents appear.

Sharon

Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.

Stan

Huh? [Looks up at them.] Oh yeah.

Randy

Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?

Stan

How 'bout some ice cream?

Kyle

Yeah, with butterscotch.

+++++


Stan nods in agreement.

Sharon

You bet, you poor dears.

Bob Saget

Now, the moment you've all been waiting for, when one of our lucky videos qualifies for the $10,000 Grand Prize to be chosen tomorrow night! The winner is [Drumroll crescendo.] Little Boy's Tea Party.

Kyle

Woohoo!

Stan

Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!

Kyle

We're gonna win $10,000! [Grandpa doesn't look pleased...]

Stan

Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! [Kyle dances gleefully.]

+++++


The Bar. Mr. McCormick and Mr. Garrison are at the bar.

Mr. Garrison

Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.

Mr. Hat

Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison

Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem! [To the barkeep.] Another Cosmo, please.

+++++


Cartman barges in throwing the bar doors open.

Cartman

All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!

Mr. Garrison

What the hell are you talking about, Eric?

Cartman

It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!

Mr. Garrison

[Gasps.] Oh.

Jimbo

Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.

Mr. Garrison

I am not gay!

Cartman

Then you did sleep with my mom?

Mr. Garrison

No!

Jimbo

He's gay!!

Mr. Garrison

Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!

+++++


Everything stops and gasps are heard.

Mr. Garrison

Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?

+++++


Two men at a table look around and get shocked. Principal Victoria and Mayor McDaniels are seen next.

Principal Victoria

Oooooh.

Mayor McDaniels

[At the same time] Hmmm.

+++++


Jesus and Father Maxi look shocked as well. No one moves.

Grizzled Man

I haven't.

Mr. Garrison

...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!

Halfy

Oh. Yeah.

Mr. Garrison

So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know.

+++++


Cartman slumps and Jimbo takes pity on him.

Jimbo

[Approaching him.] Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean.

+++++


A dirge plays as Cartman heads out of the bar. Jimbo and Mr. Garrison look on, as do Jesus and Father Maxi.

Mephesto

Wait, wait. [Cartman stops.] I know a way to find out.

+++++


He is at the bar with his little friend, Kevin.

Cartman

[Turns around.] How?

Mephesto

At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.

Cartman

Really? You can? [The dirge turns hopeful.]

Mephesto

Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but...

Cartman

How much?

Mephesto

Three thousand should cover it.

Cartman

I don't have $3000.

Mephesto

Oh. Never mind.

+++++


The bus stop, next day. Stan and Kyle are waiting.

Stan

Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.

Kyle

I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.

Cartman

[Depressed.] Hi guys.

Stan

How's it going, Cartman?

Cartman

Oh, fine. How are you guys?

+++++


Kyle looks at Stan, both are worried.

Kyle

Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?

Cartman

Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.

Stan

Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?

Cartman

Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.

Stan

Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.

Cartman

Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...

+++++


Stan and Kyle look at each other again, seeing who'll make a move first.

Cartman

Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.

Kyle

Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.

Cartman

[Suddenly bright.] You do?

Stan

Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.

Cartman

You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!

Stan

Uh, yyeah.

+++++


Cartman's house that night. The boys are on the sofa.

Announcer

And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-

Cartman

What kind of video did you guys make?

Stan

Uuh, you'll see.

Bob Saget

Well, it's time to crown the $10,000 winner. Our judges have narrowed it down to only three videos-first it's... "Dog Who Puts Hat On Master's Head."

Falsetto Bob Saget

Oh, I'm a little dog. I'm just a little dog. [The dog picks up a hat and walks towards a man on a chair.] Hahaha. [Leaps up behind the man and drops the hat in place.] Hold on, I've got to put a hat on my master's head, [Jumps off, and the man turns to see the camera.] hehehahahuh.

+++++


The audience laughs. One woman with red curly hair is particularly tickled by the video.

Bob Saget

And now our second finalist, "Little Boy Has A Tea Party."

+++++


Cartman reacts to what he sees on screen, which is a video of his tea party two days before.

Cartman

Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.

Polly

Oh, thank you, Eric.

+++++


The audience starts to laugh. Cartman is shocked, and Kyle, seeing Cartman's reaction, is afraid.

Bob Saget

Boy! Looks like this kid needs some therapy! Heheheheheh, heheheh.

Stan

We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!

+++++


Cartman's anger is beginning to build.

Cartman

I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.

Kyle

[Trying some encouragement] They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!

+++++


Stan smiles, Kyle throws his arms up.

Kyle

We're gonna win!.

Bob Saget

And finally our third contestant, "Young Child Gets Hit By A Train."

Falsetto Bob Saget

Oh, I'm such a cute little kid.

+++++


It is the scene where Kenny gets killed. Stan and Kyle are shocked, Cartman is angrier.

Falsetto Bob Saget

Hmmm, I wonder if I can get this go-cart started.

+++++


The go-cart starts and pulls Kenny along 'round a corner, back again, into some tree, and finally onto the railroad tracks.

Falsetto Bob Saget

Oh! I hope I don't get hit by a train.

+++++


The train demolishes him.

Falsetto Bob Saget

Ooooh, I sure did.

+++++


Stan and Kyle are agape, and the audience roars with laughter.

Stan

Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!

Kyle

You bastards!

Bob Saget

Now, that's what I call a joyride. Heeheeheeh.

+++++


The audience continues laughing.

Bob Saget

And the winner is, naturally, "Little Boy Being Hit By A Train,"

+++++


Stan is stunned, Kyle is cross.

Bob Saget

Nnnnhnnnhnnnh.

+++++


The audience laughs harder.

Stan

Dude. We lost.

Kyle

Dammit!

Cartman

[Slowly, deliberately.] I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously.

+++++


Getting more livid with every word.

Bob Saget

Stand up and take a bow, Mr. Marsh.

Grandpa

I won! I won!

+++++


Stan's eyes grow large.

Stan

Grandpa!!

Bob Saget

Our other finalists will have to settle for their $3000 runner-up prizes-well, see you next time.

+++++


He chuckles as the show ends.

Kyle

Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.

+++++


Cartman is very livid now.

Cartman

Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!

+++++


South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. Thunder and lightning abound.

Mephesto

All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef [Blinks up.], Jimbo [A bit shocked.], Mr. Garrison [Eyebrows up.], Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski [Surprised.], myself, my friend Kevin [Looks up at him.], or, the 1989 Denver Broncos.

Stan

Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!

Mephesto

The test results are in this envelope.

+++++


Cartman is hopeful.

Mephesto

Shall I... open it?

Mr. Garrison

[Impatiently.] Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!

Mephesto

Erhum ehrum uh [Gasps.] The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-

Announcer

[An organ plays.] Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is it - Chief Running Water? [Looks askance.] Or is it - Chef? Is it Mephesto? [Looks around.] Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison?

Jimbo

Nope. He's gay.

Mr. Garrison

You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!

Announcer

Is it Jimbo?

Jimbo

[Aghast.] Daaagh!

Announcer

Or is Officer Barbrady?

Officer Barbrady

Huh?! Where?!

Announcer

Or could it be Ned?

Ned

Could be.

Announcer

Or Mr. Broflovski??

Kyle

[Pissed.] Dad, how could you?!

Announcer

Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new South Park, in just four weeks.

Cartman

[Record scratches.] What?! [Enunciating] Son of a bitch!
