Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip. Look out, he's got a gun!  Oh.  Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia. Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take ''all'' your people in.  Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.
