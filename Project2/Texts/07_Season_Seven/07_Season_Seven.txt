''School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day...'' Chef! Chef! They've got us! Cheeeeeeef!  AAAAH! No!  No! No!  NO! All right! Hey Chef.  Ah! Oh.   Eeagh! Yeah! Good. Ah, dammit! My Goddamn little brother's trying to follow me to school, again! No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo! Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby! Kick the baby! Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. Really? What about? Totally! Yeah. This ''does'' seem really familiar. Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream? You don't? Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car.   And then ''you'' said... Weird Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day. What is a proc-tologist, Chef? What a dick! Other than his monstrous size. And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it. Are you okay? What!? No way!  You do it, Kenny! I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt! God-damnit Cartman! Stop it Cartman! God Dammit! That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it! No! You're lying! That does it! CHARGE!  It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff. We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth? Candy bars? Aaaah! Runrunruuun!    I think we ditched them.  What the? Where are, where are we? It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship. Yeah. Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay. No!  Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover? Earth? You mean that you aliens actually ''enjoy'' sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up. What?? Who canceled us? Dude, we have to try! Mighty, powerful network executives, we have come in a great distance in order to have--  Please don't cancel us. Please. Oh my God, this is great! Kenny!  The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show. And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons. Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. What the hell is that? Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve. Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something.  What? Cartman, just stay out of it. Yup. I'm not seeing anything. Me too. A reindeer? How dare she talk to us like that?! TP her house? Oh. Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious. You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman? Oh.  Uuugh. Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside. So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it! We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man! What have we done?  We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble. How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them ''days'' to clean that up! Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman! Noo! No.   Ah! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house? I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality Ah, Ah I, ah I thought... Why are they doing us one at a time?  I can get a better deal? Noo! No.   I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.  Oh. Okay. Thanks. Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now. What's this all about, Cartman? A boat ride? Well, okay. Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters. I don't know what to do.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?! Cartman! You wanna kill me?! Fine!  They did? Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense. You con-fessed?  You guys, we can't let him do this! Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house. Because it was- I still feel bad, Cartman Yeah. That makes it even worse. I know. We feel bad for other people. You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streibel. We have something we need to tell you. We have to confess that we were the ones that- Cartman?? That's not fair! But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience! This was supposed to be ''my'' story! ''My'' coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair! Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now. Oh Jesus!  You just feel bad for your''self'' that you're in detention! Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing! What should we do?  Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?  Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.  Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!  SHUT UP AND STUDY!  What are you doing? That isn't gonna work, dumbass! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're supposed to be studying!  Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard! Cartman? Cartman??  No, turdpants, it's Kyle! Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit!  Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?! Cartman?  Cartman?? Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!!  But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again! Oh, Jesus...  God damnit! Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap? We didn't do our homework. He does? Cartman? Cartman saved the day?  I-I don't know. I hate this town. I-I really really do.}}  Cool. No way. It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture. No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over! Stop it! Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman! She's ''not'' eating it, it's just coming out her backside! Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman! God dammit!  Cartman, will you stop this gayness?! That's not what I meant! Can we go now, please?! Stop it, Cartman!  ...What? No! Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson. Good. Aw, God-dammit! That does it. I'm out.  Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing! I hate you.  Come in.  So stop doing it! You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here! Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe! I can see your lips moving! See?! I just saw your lips move! Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?! Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say,  "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!" YES, dude!  Out!  Oh Jesus.  Oh no, no, no. Stop. It.  Dude, who the hell is Mitch Conner?  All right, I guess it's possible. Awww, shit! Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a great idea. Really? Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am. I think we can piece this case together now. Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory. Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet. Then saw off the arms and legs.  But before he could go through with his entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  We're in business! Do you know where your doll is? All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!  But the window isn't locked. Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it. Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty! Yeah, but how? How... ''do'' you make semen come out? Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast. What?  What??  What do we do now? Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people. We've got to do something. ...Grrrr!!!  But they said we can't charge the front door. We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, ass-face!  Ah... a a a meth lab? What is a meth lab, anyway? Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it.  We're sorry. Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore. Better how, dude? We were ''happy'' playing Laundromat Owners. Uh we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison. Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was- No.  Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble. Uh, it's okay. We know the owner. Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat. Certainly. That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners. What is Native American comedy, anyway? Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go. I said I wanna leave. What?? No, no, I mean, I-  Dog parade? How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand. What the hell are they doing?? You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away! Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for. What?! Get the hell out of here!  What? Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.  Hi Mom, Hi Dad! I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen!   Thanks. Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual. I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.  Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around? Stan?  No! Ah!  I got beat up at school... for being different. No! For not being a metrosexual. Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too? Gah! Just leave me alone!  GRRRRR!! That does it! I know what I have to do!  One ticket to New York, please. I'm going to see the ''Queer Eye For the Straight Guy'' people. Mrrh. Mr. Garrison? I'm going to New York to kill the ''Queer Eye For the Straight Guy'' people! Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first! I thought of it first! Did so! Did so! I thought of it two days ago! Cool. Clear! They aren't gay? Then what are they? AAAAAAAAAAAAH! You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy! No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help! Mom! What? Y-you want me to hang out with you? No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened? God-damnit! He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz. I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration. ''Christian'' rock?! That's a retarded idea, Cartman!  Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band! You're on, fat boy!  What a stupid asshole!  Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars? Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound. Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life! Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops. Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!  It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs! Really? All right, cool.   I don't know.   I don't know!  Um, sir-  We d-didn't think it was that big a deal. What's the matter with him? We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh... So, he's gonna get it, right? No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal ''our'' songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime! Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play! We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off! You get a platinum album for selling one ''million'' copies, you fat turd! You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now! Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways! Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey! You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever! I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop.   "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies." "We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album. He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.  Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening. From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?!   Oh. I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right." And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it. Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars. This is the worst day of my life. Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!  You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died! It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal. Dude, look! I don't know. Dude, is that your dad? I can't understand him. Why are they all out driving at the same time? Aah! There's another one!  Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside. They're saying something about taking over the entire country. We can't fight them, Cartman. Country Kitchen Buffet? That's a retarded idea, Cartman! Even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?  You guys! You guys! I have awesome news! No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends! It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants. Who said I'm inviting you?  Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend. I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to ''his'' birthday party last month, so I owe him one. Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!  Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!  "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!" You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. ''[turns and walks away, but Cartman stays close'']  Sorry, my mind's made up. I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.  That isn't it, Cartman. That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater! I know you don't.  Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice?  Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday!  Well? How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita ''this'' time? Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did. I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita. Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go? That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too. And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place. Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago. Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh. Thanks, dude. Oh wait. Cartman. Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us? I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in? All right, let's go. Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight. Aw dude, weak. Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing. Nah, I can't. We should help look for him. Yeah. And then we can try the football field.  Yeah, it's pretty cool. Oh, awesome. What? What?  I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all! It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.  Cartman! Cartman!  Jesus Christ! ''[Cartman ends up face down in the water, which isn't deep enough to drown him. He flips over and coughs.''  Oh, dude, what a little asshole! Dude, that new kid is such a douche! Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!  What are they doing? What happened?  You're having dinner with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that? Yeah. Did you make out with him, too? Wow! Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?  Oh no... Dude, this is unbearable. Aw dude, this is really hard. Throw 'em away!   Oh God...   Yeah. This is really their fault.  Who's Rob Reiner? You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke. Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now? Oh no... But... isn't that, kind of, lying? What?? So, tobacco helped to build America. That sounds perfectly reasonable. But dude, you're making stuff up. Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now! This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something. Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial. No, we really want nothing more to do with these people. What are you doing?  Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous.   Who's going to kill you? Yeah dude, don't get us killed too.   No dude, get away! Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself! Yeah dude. You were totally wrong. No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded. Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula! God-damnit!  No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it. You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to ''force'' others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole! No. No we didn't, dude! No we didn't!  Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!   Why? Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.  'Kay.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.  Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live. Dude, not now!  Jeez, he's worse than I thought. No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins. What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh? Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is ''really'' cute, huh?  Hey. Uh, this is Stan. Okay. Okay, come on you guys.  Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there. What are you doing?  Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball. Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Tolkien. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life? Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time! Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?! God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home! Oh, like ''you'' know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy! Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back! Yeah. She is.  Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.  Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play! What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain? Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back. No Ike! Shh!  Ike's not my little brother anymore? Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay? You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? If he knew the situation, he might be- Guys.  Guys, I need your help. It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone. Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.  I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then- What?  Is that true? I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change ''his'' mind before Christmas, then your parents won't ''have'' to give my family money. It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.  We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure. Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines. Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible. Four. How about fifty daura? Fifty-five daura. Okay. Sixty daura. Okay. Got it.  Why not? You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid. All right! We're going to Canada! Hey, where the hell are you going??  I'm trying!  No. Hey! We're in Canada! Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back? Who's that? Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is? So how do we get to Ottawa? Word! Who are you? That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves. French Canada? We don't have time for this. Hello? Okay, you can come with us. God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW! Can we just get going, please? There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now! Well come on!  Do you think we can still make it in time? We need to see the new Prime Minister. No. No!!  Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.    Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was- Ike! Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and ''that'' makes us more family than anything.  But ''why'' are you making such strange laws??  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!  What the hell?? Well yeah, but ah-I got my brother back. Dude, come on. What? Yeah! Go home, you little dildo! Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!  That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long. Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  And they had big heads and big black eyes… What? No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so. What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about? Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me. No I don't remember that! No, because the aliens erased my memory! Aw dude, I hate repeats!  What?  Haha, very funny. Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing? Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Ooh. Oww... Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooh-ah. Uuuuu, aaaaah.   Aaaaaa, aaaaaah! Ooagh! You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!  Nope! It has to be Kyle!     Gahaaa! Derrr! Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych! All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle. No, go ahead. I'm dry. But it was one of the best times I've ever had. Okay.  This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven. Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.  It's ''that'' guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities! What are you doing, man?!  When do we get to eat. I'm hungry. Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me, you guys!  ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you, Lord. This is like my fifth time.  Aw God, that movie pissed me off. Santa!  Oooo, very nice. How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys? Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth!   Tell us about it. No. There's even World War Three to look forward to.  Uuugh. That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long. What is it, Chef? We didn't go to your comedy show. Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it! Can too! Oh God-damnit!! But they say I can't be in their club!!  Put more clay on the balls.  You can't do that! You're an ''art'' teacher! We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic. Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house. Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.   Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank! Should be fine. Okay.  Yep. All set. Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game. Heh yeah, that that's right. No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night. It's the right address-wait! Look there!  So? Kyle, you're being an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Come on, let's go!  Aw man, that was sooo awesome!  Who cares?? Me??  Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her. Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime.   Damn! Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine. Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46. Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??  Oh, for Christ's sake! Thank you, Stan.  "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now? Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй. They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal. Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!  Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere? No need. I have one for you right here.  Is there anything else I can get for you? You do that. Goodnight, Kyle.  Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle. Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack. Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.  Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is! We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle. Why not? He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us.  I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride? I just thought we should find a private place to... talk. Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  So how are things, Kyle? And you feel like you have to confess. I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while.  Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness.  Won't be long, Kyle.  I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours. They did? But can I still kill Kyyyle? Uh, can we see them-him-her? What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball? You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now? What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime. Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever. So... so then, how can you feel bad? ...But he's not gonna get in trouble. What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later? Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man! Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry! It's over this way! Come on! So how are things, guys? I'm afraid I can't let that happen. Can't I?   Hi guys. I told them everything, you guys. It's over. My consciences just caught up with me. I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later. I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible. Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you- Hm.  Math homework, Math homework. Where did I file that?  Bush is a Naizi ...Eh the... Foggy who?   But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off. Maaaa. M-maaaa. Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  In those days? In those days? In those days? I'm trying to have a flashback. You know. If I have a flashback, then I can ''see'' what 1776 was like first-hand! No. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.  Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa! That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776.  All I have to do is be ''thinking'' about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers! Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Benjamin Franklin?  Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew! Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time. Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers! I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history! Or a really sweet one.  Whoa, here it goes!  Ohhh awesome!!!  Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is? Oho yes! I did it I did it! Oho kick fucking ass, dude!  No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback. Super neato!  But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report. And I am the official messenger boy, I am.  Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day. It's a bitch, ain't it? Wow.  Whoa, how very very relevant. Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time. Wow!  If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say. I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.   You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too." The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.  Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.  Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts? Oh, you mean this one?   There we go, Saright? That's a very pretty dress.  Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez. Nono, Jeh- Jeh- Jeh- Jennifer Lopez. Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts? And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you.  Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass! Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.  Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez. Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle? Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss? Is nice? Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court. Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too. I agree. Those places are stupid. Hey, I'm on your guys' side. Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five! All right all right, here's ten dollars!  Yeah, I wanna leave. What? Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez.  What do they want? S'awright? What? What?  Hello, are you still there? You want to sign Ms. Lopez? Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich! Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs!  There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!  Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  "Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!"  Awesommme. Yeeessss.   Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha! Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week.  And famous. Jennifer Lopez? Not me! I'm sure it was just a mistake. Shut your God-damned mouth! Nobody! Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop! I will! Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now. Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez. What the hell are you doing? Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep! Sleep!  Sleep! Moooommm!  Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!  He-yesss.  She's not here right now. NO! I'm not going out in his car. I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.  I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!  NO! Aw, God dammit!  Aww- awww, dude! OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!! Aww crap. OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW! I told you this would happen.  Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck. EHAGH!  Ben Affleck is naked in my bed! You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again! What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!! What news? S'aright. Oh, balls!  Guys, I need to talk to you. I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez. Stop doing what? Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See?  Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez. Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does. Quiet, Ms. Lopez. Guys... Uh... Uh...  I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?  I got you kinda! I got you kinda! Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar. Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve? My God... What have you got, Marsh?  Jesus, we're too late. Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her! Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death.  The torso he would dump into the lake.  And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie. Looks like the game is over, old man!  Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington.  And get us some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass! Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll. No sign of forced entry. We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over! Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat. Right. I think I know exactly where to start.  Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?! Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth!  You're going down, Butters! You hear me?! You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying! Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample.  You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup! Stop playing games! That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body. I don't know. I was hoping you guys did. Really? Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?! Follow me to the bathroom.  Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup. Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well, Butters?! Well pull harder! Try doin' it faster. Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?! The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes! Let's go!   Kyle!  I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew! Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them.  Why not? Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got! Yeah! This was our hot lead! Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off! All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh! We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process. Kewl! Uh bonus? Me neither.  Hey! Broflovski's a good cop! Awwwwrrr-auugh.  We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.   Butters? Are you still trying to give a semen sample? Well, keep tryin', Butters.  A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods? Uh oh... Bang bang bang...    On your American Express. You did? Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five? Man, Indians have it good, huh?  I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?! Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude.  Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians! That's right!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS? Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now. Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts! You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies!  What? Tell us? Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ''ever!''  What a dork! Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall!  Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th.  We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys. That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.  Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you! Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies ''mega'' gay! GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  You're straight like a freeway! You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!! ...So? I'm half bisexual! I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi. Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp. Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that- Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle. We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle. Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy. He's not our friend.  Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.  That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade. Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude!  God dammit!   Heheheheheh heheheheheh.  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?   Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!  It worked for Creed!  You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius! Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before ''you'' guys do! Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go!  Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle!  Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters!  No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!   Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me.  I told you, Tolkien. Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives. We are going to start... a Christian rock band. Wait!  Still want to leave, Tolkien?  Thank you. All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Tolkien, give me a smooth bass line.  Tolkien, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass. Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line!  Almost there, you guys. Because, Tolkien, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.  I'm going to kill you one day, Tolkien. Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too.  No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care!  No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool! Tolkien, look away to the right.  More! So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover.  Oh hey guys. How's it going?  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum. That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha! It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album. I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta!  Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..  I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ. Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.  Who are you? Yeah, you guys are real hardcore. Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.  Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent. Yes, we sure do.  Well what are you saying? That, that ''you'' don't really love Christ?? Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this?? I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now. ''Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.'' ''Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.'' Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly. Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense. We're Faith Plus One, Tolkien, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!  Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now.  Ahhh, this is the best day of my life.   Thank you very uh- wah? ''Myrrh'' album? You mean to tell me I can never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?! GOD DAMMIT!!  Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums! OH, FUCK JESUS!!   Ah, fuck you, Tolkien! You black asshole!  Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring. Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly. , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey! I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body. Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.  Calm down! We cannot understand you!  Old people! Oh God, they're coming!  They're not gonna stop until we're all dead! Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong? My God, he's right.  Except for you, Kyle. I believe that's us... thank God.  More old people! Old people gone mad! So our only solution is to cut off their life force. No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here. Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do. Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week. I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight. We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people. [''they appear from the sides of buildings dressed in black and then gather in front of one of them''] At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. Yeah! Aw yeah! Well, right, or we could always do that. Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome. Who's joking?  You have AIDS?  Wow! Casa Bonita?! Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff! This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita!'' You... your Mom said you could take three friends. Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny? Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?! I have never been a dick to you. Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?  Okay, except maybe for that ''one'' time. Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place   Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.  Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!   Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!  What isn't it? ...I don't understand the difference. Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something. Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people? Okay, so how do you act ''genuinely'' nice to people? Like what? Who's there? Take that, Jimmy!  Oh, Kyle. Hey. Uh...  Knock knock, Kyle! Hey Kyle. Well what? I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go. So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool. I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later.  I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore. Good. Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!  Butters, can you keep a secret? For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible. A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth. Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...''pray'' that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything? Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust. Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer?  Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth. I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus. According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours. No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter! Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry!  Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here!   All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks. No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth. Well, you know, with your wiener.   Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present. Hope you have a good one. See you later.  Yes?  Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything? Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.  Casa Bonita, here we come! ''Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!''  Well, let's get going, shall we?  Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would ''want'' us to go. You know Butters... Next Saturday?? I'll ''never'' be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.  Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!  Butters! Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!  The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time... There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.  No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh... We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can.  Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.  What what what? UUuuugh!!   Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way! The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals! They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive. We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins. Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location.  Good. Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town. All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice.  Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble. We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter. Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God! It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!   We've got to fight them off!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!  Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!   which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well. We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you! Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you! Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter. I love you too, man. I just  Hah!  Oh, that would be so bad-ass! ''We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon.'' You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.  "Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show. What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle. ''Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]'' We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great! But... Casa Bonita.  Stand back!   Less than a minute! Less than a minute! Oh, awesome!!   Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!   Yeeeesss! Totally.   Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag. Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place! Go kick his ass, Stan. Will he bleed? That's all we care about. Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in? They're just standing there, talking.  You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole! Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?  Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love. Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.  Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together? Oh my God...  Eeheehee, Jesus Christ.   Oh no! You guys broke up? Uh oh, the jilted lover returns. Damn, that kid is cool, huh? I'm going to kill myself.  You guys, Kenny's eating his own hand.  Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey.   Nothing. Nothin' Na- Due-nothing.  Gross dude!  No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes. We're sorry. Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah! Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us. Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you? Got it!   Isn't he awesome, you guys? Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol.  Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.  Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today. Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome. Oh my God, that is what ''I've'' always said.  I love this guy!  Wow, a commercial? God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps? So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!  Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle? Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.   Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house. Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!  Heh, okay, okay.  Dead?? Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part? Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.  I'm not eating the cupcake.  Jesus Christ! HAAAA! They're going to kill me!  The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!  You guys have to help me!  Please, you guys, I don't know what to do! If I go, you guys go! Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us!  Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong!  You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company!  Aw awww! Right. What are we playing again? Got it.  What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank! Yeh-heah, right! What a whore!   God, what a fag! How do ''you'' know? We haven't even tried the food yet. Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.  Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas. We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas! Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time. I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all. Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you.  HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas! What? No! No, this can't be happening!  You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!! Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to ''your'' family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!  This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now. You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents? Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all. We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-''eight'' hours to still give our patents twenty-''four'' hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.  Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing! You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort. Of course I care about Christmas- oh, Christ on a stick!  Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here! Weak. Look out! Oh Jesus Christ. Which road?!  But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister. Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time! How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away.  How could you be so stupid! Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.  And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents.   I'm gonna kill you, Kyle. It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada. Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom! Suck my balls. Don't kick the Goddamn baby! Waaaah--  Ow. I gotta go tinkle.  No! No no no no no! Chocolate!  Kyle! Dude, sweet!  Dude! Visitors! That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors! Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before. No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that? I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream. What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef? Chef, we're in a repeat. It all started when Cartman got an anal probe. You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes. Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times. You all right? Where to now, Chef? Go on. Oh, nice going, Cartman! We wanted to see an alien planet or something. What do we do??? Let's go!  What is that? Chef! End of the road!  It's the police! Chef!!  Uh.  We're in the alien ship.  My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space. Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy. Dad? Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, ''Contact''. Okay okay, take the form of something else! Nno, that's stupid too.  No!  I like it. You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?  Our planet is just a reality-TV show? Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment! Oh shit, did we do that? Wait! Wait, they can't do this! Uh, let ''us'' talk to the network heads! Please, take us to them! Please! Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads? Uh, Earth? Look, we just want to talk to you about the show. But, sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get ''really'' pissed off at each other. Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us. Dude, we're trying to save our planet here! Sirs, uh, if you'll just let- Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong.   No, wait. We won't tell anybody if you don't cancel our show! I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent. Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders.  Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude.  Yeah dude, not cool. Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one. Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy. That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one.  Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.  Stay clear, guys, stay clear. Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one. Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads. See? Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool! Like what?  Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, art-whore! D'you think that's enough? Okay Is this the right house? Kyle, we all agreed to do this! Let's go, Kyle!  Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together. We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up. Yes, dude! Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody. What about him? Butters.  So what should we do?  ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle! Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright? Cartman, what are you doing? You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed! They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station. We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true? Butters? He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it. It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess. Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.   Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final. You, you do? How? Wugh! Two weeks of this! Let's go see a movie!   Uh... war? Yeah.  War is not my voice.  You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us! No, you just have to study.  Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study! How?! Cartman? Oh no... Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea. Aww crap. I guess we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys! Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress- Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war. Oh, no, nononono. Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-  Awww, now we lost two in our study group! Uh, we didn't do it. Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Daylight Savings and we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then- He does?  Can't be What the hell are they doing now?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off! What are you gloating about? What's the matter? What's she doing? I don't know, meh, maybe he ''can't'' help it. Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make ''us'' look dumb? Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten your''self'' into this mess, then we'll help you. All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything.  It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it.  Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need solved, for a dollar? Have you reported this to any other authorities? We're on the case. Detective McCormick found something interesting.  You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  His plan was to use a hammer. Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head.  The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub.  Just the news.  Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady. Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar!  Yes it is! All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny. You got it, Ken?  Put that away, dude!   The pain gave him sick pleasure.  Hey, kid, what are you doing? Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation! Aw crap! Son of a bitch stupid FBI! No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that little girl's doll before those FBI guys do. We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.  They've gotten really good at this good-cop bad-cop thing. It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.  Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!  South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll! I don't know. Dude, we just can't tell on them. Jesus! They're gonna kill her!  Hey, you butt-holes can't play FBI here! We're gonna charge the front door and go get it. Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us! We go get the doll ourselves. That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.  Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse! Did so!  We got it. Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home? We do what we can, sir. Sure. I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama.  Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework? Damn. Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-  We just wanna be junior detectives. It'll get better, guys.  Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time into it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners? I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle? You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. I'll see you guys at school tomorrow. Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff. No thanks. Thanks. ...I think I have a better idea.  Yes, I have a suit I need dry-cleaned, and pressed, please. Wow, dude. Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here.   We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans! We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team! We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars!  We need something that'll get us money tomorrow! Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters! Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars! No! I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle! Look, we- we've got nothing to lose. Dad.  Good luck.  They, they had it! They freakin' had it! You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some. A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!! What??? You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans!   Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!  Come on, you guys! This is our town! We can stay. And fight. Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  No! We won't let you destroy our town! Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life. This land is not for sale. It's all right, dad.  You're gonna be all right. No, Dad, NO. What can I do? Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus! Hey, my name's Stan, and I was- Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS? An inward journey? That sounds kinda gay.  Ah! Oh, dude! Dad! Dad! Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite. Dude, who the hell are you? Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night. So, I'm watching the season premiere of ''Boy Meets Boy'' on television, and then ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top. I know! Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll. You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend. Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all?? Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover!  Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look! All right. Let's work it!  What the...? Hey Craig. These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us! Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are! We're metrosexual!! Dude! W-what are you doing? We're not straight! You're straight! Wow, is that from Origins? Well, what can we do about it? What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore. Yeah. Wait, what?  Hey, what's goin' on? Wow, we look great! You'd better shut up, Craig. It is not! Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you! Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us? Yeah. It's cool, holmes. Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us.  Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band.  Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented.  See what? I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band! Hey dude. No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet! You got a computer? See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer! Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too. What the hell is that?  We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again! Boy, I'll say!  Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice. Oh yeah. It is??  Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity. What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.  Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.  Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy! I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band. What?? Is this for real?? This is for real!  So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman? Are you- gonna pay 'im? I thought albums win either gold or platinum. Hm. Guess he got what he deserved. Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive? But they kill people. I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die. What is that? I think so. What is he saying?  Oh! [''drops his hockey stick and holds his hands to his face''] Dad, I'm scared. I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore! Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving. Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa. What's that? The American Association of Retired Persons. Hey Dad. Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them? No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it? All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town.}} The old people have blockades here [''south entrance''] and here [''west entrance'']. The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office. Yeah, I remember hearing about that. All right! We did it!  ...Yeah, ''or'' we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in. Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault! Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it. And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.  Dude, I wonder where Kyle is. Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.  What's Casa Bonita? Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us. Yeah, it's kinda weird. Yeah. Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there.  Really? Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do. I knew he'd turn up. Cartman, stop it! Yeah, screw that kid! Well, maybe he won't fight. All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass.  No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass. I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch.  Huh? Dude, stop it. Shut up, Butters! I'm...  going over to his house for dinner tonight.  He's a really nice kid. What's that? No. The... Book of Mormon? What's that? Who's Joseph Smith?  No! What happened then?  No, I was supposed to be home at eight. ...Hello?  Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith? The guy who spoke to God and Jesus. That's not what the Harrisons said. The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right. They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come ''we'' never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink? But that's just you and your friends. Mr. Harrison said that I should be following Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is. Yeah. See? That's what happened to me! That's what they made me think, too! Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented. What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance. Wow, you made this? Uh, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh...   Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.  Yeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy. What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground? Yeah, but... how? Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat? It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri. But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.  Hey Gary. Dad! Yeah. ...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet? No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind? No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translations were hidden!  I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad! Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad! I'm not hanging around that kid anymore. You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me. Oh brother. I don't?  Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one.  ...Whoops. Mom...  Dad, it was just a- What?? Yeah, what's the problem? Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand. Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice. Huh? Yeah, maybe you're right.  What are you doing, Cartman?  Well, get away from us then. Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own! Daaaad! Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us! Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?  Oh all right. Why? So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks.  Yup. It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do! Well, I guess we learned our lesson. All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen. Football. Okay. 23!  What?   Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me? 'Cause I need to know why she broke up.  Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her? What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me. Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy! Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me? Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me. She's a continuing source of inspiration to me. Well?  Jesus...  ...Go away. Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone? You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken... Can we go, please? No, dude, I feel worse! Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life! I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control!  Something I should have done a long time ago.  Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me ''right now! [Bebe rolls her eyes and sighs]'' All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need ''her'' friends to do it! Tell her I love her!  Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?  I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else. There's nothing else I ''can'' do. She ''was'' my whole life. Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I ''should'' hang with the Goth kids. But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living? All right, so how do I join you? ...'K.  Yeah. They're not? Well I don't drink coffee.  So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so. What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token? Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?  ...conformist. Butters? What's the matter with you? Huh? But you just got dumped. No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all. He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. As Cartman would you say, Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.   Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Yeah. Let's play ball. Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action. Sure dude. Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure? Dude, Cartman. Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way.   Dad, don't get carried away. Whoa whoa, Cartman. Cartman, calm down! It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined. Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures. No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not? What's going on?? Do something, Kyle!  You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore.  All right dude, let's get the hell out of here! I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses. Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister. What? What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.  Oh no! And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure.  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! What is that?   Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles Say, did any of you children What the? A repeat??  I've been feelin' Déjà vu all mornin', children. I ''knew'' somethin' strange was goin' on! We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away. He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children. That's right. Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice. We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal. Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum. Well, doctor? That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some ''real'' help! That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center ''now''!  And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff. Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did. Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake. Eric, that's enough! It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with! Okay. Now it's funny again. What's it doing? Where is the signal being sent to?  Help! Get in the car, children! Get in the car!  Can you see anything, children?  God damned aliens!  Hold on, children!  I don't think we're outta the woods yet.  That ain't no police!   You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Aw crap! Children!  Jeff!! The aliens took the children upon their ship. Did you find out what the aliens were up to? They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to! Butt sex? Who's havin' butt sex? What the hell is that?! Chaos theory?? Huh? Oh my God! We have to stop them! We have to find a way to stop those aliens!  Oh no.  That doesn't make any Goddamn sense!  Hello there, children! I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it.  What do you guys think? I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.  What's all this fightin' about, children?! Aw nah. Don't tell me ''you'' children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too. No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay! Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool. Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison. Sure. Come on in. Well, what do you want me to do about it? Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them. Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying ''that'', and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop." Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that!  The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis? and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley. see the alien space ship last night?   What seems to be the problem? All right, let's see here.  Oh my God!! Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle!   Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland... Wait, what's this?   I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream. I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way. How do we uh, make it come out? Can I see this thing, ''please''? It, it's sending a transmission of some kind.  Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars. You-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... polar-- polarity! I can ''switch'' the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to!  What??  Oh no! When I reversed the polarities, I found this:  It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says.  Wait a minute! Butt sex! Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh-- Chupacabra's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usually have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code!  Ladies and Gentlemen, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe.  It's a simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this.  I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show. Waaaait, you don't understand! There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit!  But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory! Chaos theory, it was, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of ''Punky Brewster'' before it was canceled. Cancelled... Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are canceling ''Earth''!  Wait a minute, jackets! If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A virus- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!  (Gaaahaha, he got you again!)  (Derrr!)  (Yes it is!) (Awesome) (Oh no!)  (Me too.)   (I don't know.) (Yeah, how the fuck is that?!) (Yeah!) (Yeah! Fuck you!) (Me??) (I think so too.) (Yeah!) (Yeah, maybe we should.) (A what?) (I'm doing my homework.) (But Dad, I-) (Woohoo!)  (Heheehee, heheh yeahah) (Yeah!)  (Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.) (Aww, it's okay, little fella.)  (What do we do now?)  (Pakew! Pakew!) (Yeah!) (I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!) (That's the truth.) (Woohoo!!) (Woohoohoo!) (What? Is it?) (Yeah!) (Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.) (Yeah) (Yeah!) (Yeah.)  (You guys!) (Oooooo my God!)  (Woohoo!) (Yeah.)  (Woo-hoo!) (Yeah!)  (Well yep, that's what I think.) (Uh huh.) (Me neither!) ('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!) (N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!)  (And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...)  (Aah!)    Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too. Coop coop. Wow.  Hello boys. No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you. Very well, I shall show my true form.  Rah rah rah rah-rah. Rah rah rah rah.  How about this?  Dy-no-mite!   Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh huh.  Don't piss on the moon, babe. All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take?  All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings.  I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay. That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning. Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches.  We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real.  A few billion years ago we realized, "what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer, and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great!  Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun! Why? That should get the relay working again.  Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been canceled. No.  Bang bang bang...   What does it mean? Hello there, Christopher.  Let's go! Let's go!  Well, so where are they? What's this all about, Mr. Smith? Gerald Broflovski? My name is Harry Gintz and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada. <i>Follow the only road.</i> This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl! Attention universe! Be sure to tune in next week for another exciting episode of... ''Earth''! The Asians  It's outrageous fun and it's all-new! ''Earth''! On Fognl. Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for JIMMY!  Welcome to the Three Feathers Comedy Club.

The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be funny anymore.  Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid ''Earth'' has been canceled Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud.  Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources. Wouldn't do any good. All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody.  Awww. Welcome to Planet Fognl, home of the Joozians, who control all media in the universe.  Can I help you? Where are you visiting from? Ooooh, I watch that show all the time.  Can I help you? Gaaahahaha!  Oh, sure, come on in, Earthlings. We're just checking out our new show. They hate each other! Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have haglar yet? Where do you wanna go? Meroni's? Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect.  Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business. Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings. You must have some Joozian ancestry. Oh my God, would you look at the heglars on that joozinek? Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah! Oh yeah, let's see those heglars! Oh, man, I am so wasted!  Man, screw this place! Let's go get a hotel room and a hooker! Yeah!  Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!!     Oh yeah!! Oh yeah, yeah-yeah! Oh yeah! Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your jagon. Oooo, I knew that was coming. He-all right, all right Earthlings! Ya, you win! The show can stay on. Just be sure to keep up the wars and violence. We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. It-it's a riot! Gah, why?  Oh yeah, let's do haglar. Not on a Flakmar, too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch! This place is fantastic! You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud! Oh, yeah! Oh yeah! Good. Woohoohoo! Yeah! Oh! Oh, that's it, baby! You're getting my jagon hard!  Yeah, suck my jagon! Oh, God. Eh, my head.  What did we do? Oh God, we ''did'' suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right?? They really got us by the nezmins. Well, we've got a five o'clock with the Yurka producers.    Damn it, are you kids just gonna sit here all night again and drink six dollars' work of coffee?! Why don't you get a life?!  Hey Jimmy. Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see ''him''. You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman. Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. ''That's'' why everyone ditched on your show. Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh?   I love art class! Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streibel's house got covered with toilet paper. I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves ''that'' kind of brutality.  Hey fellas! Yep. I'm in jail. Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I just can't get my behavior under control! Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here! Well I'm just a little asshole, is what ''I'' am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong! You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too. Hi, Dad. Yeah. Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.  Officer, can I stay in jail, please? Mmuh well, not really, no.  Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school! Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez! Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too! Ah, I was at home. Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly. How do I do that? Well how do I make semen... come out of my body? I'm not playing. I really don't know! No! My wiener?? Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening. ...ow... Ow... It's not workin'.  Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'. NOOooo! Okay!! ...ow... Ow! Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww! Yes? Well I'm tryin', but nothing's comin' out. Okay.  Ow. Ooww!  Fellas! Hey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample! Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out. How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away? Yeah, ahh, that's right! Hey, I know! How about a dog parade?  Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable! Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads. Oh...  Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classes. Oh, hi Eric.  ...Ohhh! Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... inspiration. Wow!  Awww. Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars. Well done! Ow... Wow, neato! An album cover!  Cheese! Cheese! Oh... Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are.  Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out.   Heeheeheeyeah.  Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus. Fuck you, Eric.  Wow, that's gonna be so fun! What's this all about, Eric? Well, sure I can! Nnn-''how'' terrible? What??  I just see stars.  Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God! It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God! When do you think uh it'll get here? What?? Oh, you mean we're gonna die?! Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter?? AAAAHH!  Oh Jeez!  But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too. Are you sure? But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?  Oh God, oh God!  Hello??  Hwaaaah!! Wuh, wait, well, what happened?? What about my parents. Did you see them?  Oh my God, let me see!  How many survivors are there? You should all come down here. Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me. ''But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.<br>Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,<br>Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl. [the shelter lid opens again]'' Eric?  Eric, is that you? Who's coming this way? Oh God! I hate cannibals! Noooo! But I can't see nothin'. Are we out in the destruction? Aw man. Huh... Oh, it's terrible. Whoa! Whaaat?? AAAAHH! Waaaaaah! Ooohhhh! Ooooh, what happened? What happened?! Oh no! Uh w-where?? Aren't you coming? Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.  ''[off-screen] You take away the biggest part of me. [the worker listens, then goes to the source of the sound] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go. [hums a bit; the worker arrives to see him sweeping] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...''  HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected? You're not a cannibal, are you? Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we ''can'' repopulate the earth. Yippee! I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  I'm ready whenever you are. Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!  Ma'am, can I use your phone? He's a peckerface, that's what he is!  Let him have it, Stan! Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl! We came over to cheer you up, Stan! Well what do we do now? What's Raisins? This place is awesome! Whoa!  W-we are. You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that? Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go. When do you ''wanna'' see me? Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars.    She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!  I waited all night for you to get off work. I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you. Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present. It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit.   hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime. O-kay! Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship. Hi! Is Lexus here? Darling!  Oh God. I missed you so much.  Hey Lexus. Wuh it's me, Butters. I'm fine. I miss you though.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going? Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch ''The Exorcist'' on DVD. Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times. Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God. Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again. Uh but I spent it all. On my girlfriend.  Yeah. Yup! Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you. Okay.  Here we are, Mom and Dad!  Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her. Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus!  Mom? Dad? This is Lexus. Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus. Huh? Oh, I see.  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint! ... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore? So that's it? We're broken up now? Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over. Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.  Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me. Yeah.  It sure does hurt. Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life. Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid... Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan.  Butters, w-where is everybody? Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?! I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see ''him''?! So then, how come ''you'' came? Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show!  I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious!  Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do! I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH!   Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy? Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much. Hey there fellas. Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled.  To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been ''born'' that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve! Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.  Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy.   Why not?  ...There's already a Crips?! No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve? Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it. Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver. Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips. Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.  Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim. Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.  Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fantastic Denver chapter. We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be ''born'' a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident? I agree. I mean, it's like  "come on"! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs? Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group? Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it.  I don't know, Timmy, just play along. Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown.  Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros? That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park.   Well hello, officers. We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure. Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver! So does that mean we can join the c-c...club? Wow, these guys really are crippled.  Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant. Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time. You dawgs keep it real, too.  Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy. Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops? No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool.  Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung... Pao Chicken, please. What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.  Huh? Ah- are you sure?  Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something. Actually, it was a regular lemonade. Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.  Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops? A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg. Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much. Yo, don't be dissing my n***as, dawg. They're my f-friends.  Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole! Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school. Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the n***a on your left.  Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six-   Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer? The... B-Bloods? The-they do?? But... but why do they hate each other? Oh, so you used sssytemm cells like Christopher Reeve?  Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong. Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to s-stop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk. You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there. This is gonna be t-terrific! Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience. We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by. You bet.  Oh, we will.  It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles. But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa. Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers. Look, we have the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together? Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  I said, "I mean,  Come on!"  Come on. Come on. I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger. I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in? Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-problem? Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice. Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote. Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock. Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Hey Stan. For- Forw- Forw-w-w what? She's what? ...Okay.  Stan says you're a cont...  you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont- -cont- You're a cont-tinuing source of inspiration to him.  She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over.  Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke? Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven. Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now? And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve.  Okay, people. What are we rambling about now? Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.  People, I told you, you have to share the stage. And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway. The Native Americans have purchased the land out from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership. The Native Americans bought the bank. Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes. Three hundred thousand dollars.  As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help? Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you "NO!" Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them.  Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience.  Used to be I didn't need an airplane. As most of you know,  I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research. Though it is controversial,  the disabled. In the coming days  that stem-cell research is a miracle. Thanks for having me on again, Larry. Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet. Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement.  Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again. Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you? I am better with each passing day.   What? And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?  Chris!  Hello, Gene! So good to see you! Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?! Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha! I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.  Hack Man! No...  NOOOO! You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!! Awwwww.  Yeah! Yeah, that's right!  Yeah!! Ha-a-aaa-haaa-a. Timmeh!! Rrruh Timmeh! Timmih!!  Timmmeh! Timmmih!  Timmmih!  Tih... ti-timmih. Timmih!  Timmih? Uh-tu-Timmih! Timmih! Timmih!  Oh, Timmih.  Timmih! Timmih!  Timmih!  Timmih! Timmih! Timmih.  Timmih!  Tim-mih. Timmih!! Timmih!! Timmih! Timmih!   Hello, boys. What can I do for you? Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts. Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much. Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them? ...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one.  My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who, with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms. All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you.  Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that taking cells from a fetus is... unethical. And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris? Wow.  Wow. You are? The Crips hang out at that old warehouse down there,  but ...nobody goes in there. Is they for real, manh? The only Crips is born Crips, dawg. Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool! All right, you wanna thug with the Five Point Crips? Bitches, all you gotta do is pop some punk-ass Bloods. So you sayin' yuh down? Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell you about my little Gs, Roller and 4 Legs here. They just smoked thirteen Bloods in one night! That ain't never been done before! You're not just in, you're the baddest mofo Crips in town! Cipac!  Turn up the beat so we can celebrate our new Gs Five-Points style! The Bloods! You stupid mofos are dead! Wait a minute. What did you say? I guess we could at least give havin' fun together a try. It's like  Come on. I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate. Hey you kids. What the hell do you think you're doin'? You sure you don't want to press charges?   Yes, ma'am. Where to? Certified letter for the rock band MOOP? One night? You're kiddin'? You're kiddin'? One night? Yeah, that's right. Come on. And they got us marshmallows and ginger ale. You talkin' crazy, dawg.  Uh huh. Cool. He's right. All right.  Alrighty. Keep it real, dawg.  There you are, Jimmy! Hey, it's Gary! How are you? It's so nice to meet you. Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done! Great to meet you! Jimmy, your mother was gettin' worried about you. Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come into the kitchen please? Uh have a seat, Jim. Your mother and I need to talk to you.  Son, your mother and I have noticed a change in your behavior. And... we're worried that you might be involved in a gang. Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand. Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now?   Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength. Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't know what is. Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now. Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom!  The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom. And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck. Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade is underway! ''[in a rainbow peacock float Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter and Stuart ride and cheer. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny ride in a banana float which features an ocean wave and a palm tree. On the tree waves a rainbow flag that says'' "Here to Stay" Uugh. Three! Two! One!  Yaaaaay!  What an inspiration. Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now. Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave? Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problem.   Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?! Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers! SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you!  Okay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals. Butters, will you pay attention, please? Will you kids shut up?  Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside!  And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class? Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties! Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  Okay, children, now, the biggest skank of all was was an old fat-ass by the name of- Oh my God. Yeah.  So long, South Park.  Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless. Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money! Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that. We're not moving, ass-faces! You had me at "free blanket."  All right children, let's take our seats. Well, uh d-don't you all look nice. What the hell is going on?? Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!! WHAT?? It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore.  Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over. Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave? Well, you know... Huh. Oh hey Randy. Well thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom? Not, not like that? Uh-Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek. Oh, wuh, well uh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place. Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass. Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?! Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?! Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!! No, ''your'' shoes say you take it in the butt!! One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!  Chef, can I talk to you? Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me! Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?  Kyle, what are you doing here? What?? That's what I'm doing! They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours! No you didn't! No you didn't! I thought of it yesterday! I thought of it before you were born! Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together. Room service.  Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.  Well crap, that didn't work.  Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing! But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left. Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!  Oh my God.  Gone??  I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind!  Stop them! They're crab people! You bastards!  Yes! They were trying to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world! So now, can you ''please'' change your network's programming?  And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a "Mongol," not to be confused with a "mongoloid" like the actor, Nicolas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what  the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back. Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Okay, children, let's take our seats.  Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis.  He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste. All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson?  Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon?  Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children?  Here he comes!  What'd he say? Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out!   How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans?  Rats! Hey  Hey, I don't want no trouble! I don't want no trouble! You just... take what you want and leave!  I open register  Here. Here one hundred twelve dorrar! It's all I have. Yeh take! You take! Uh one hundred twelve dorrar! I no want no trouble. Just take it and leave! Here! Here two order of Kung Pao Chicken, and small ice tea!  Now go, just go!  Hello! Police? I've just been robbed by two gang members! No business... Christmas time come and nobody wanna eat Chinese food. Looks like I might as well close.  Herro? Shitty Wok, take ur orda prease! Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease.  Herro, Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take ur orda prease? Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far. Gonna cost ya a lot of money... hmm let's see. How many people? Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a lot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred dolla. Fifty daura?! You flight to Canada cost at least three thousand dollar! Hey! Stop wasting my time with fifty-five daura! No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura! Sixty-two daura. Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.  Hehehehe, never try to barter with a Chinese man. Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine.  Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking. Looking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright.  Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh!  Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking. As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down. Now would be a good time to reflect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you believe in. Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines, and it looks like you made the wrong one.  Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true!  And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too? Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good. Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason! That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.  Sarah!  You guys have got to see these shoes I bought! Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!  I'm good. You? Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing? Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone. I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.  Chris, that's enough! You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells. They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!  Not so fast, Chris! We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over! And now we're going to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again!  East Side Bloods!  Right on! We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson from the Special Gang unit in Denver. You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time! Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!  Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods. Don't act like you don't know, you lil' punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too. Oh, what a fighter. The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?! He's right.   Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square. Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music propaganda! Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle! Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song. The boys are going to give a presentation at ''our'' rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!  Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side. Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song! <i>Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!</i> <i>And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.</i> <i>No, but war shouldn't be our goal.</i> <i>If it means war, then we say NO!</i>  He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another. <i>And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!</i> <i>And me, I'll be the caring soul.</i> Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes. Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect. All right, time to win some money! Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em.  How's it goin', Gerald? Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks. Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars?? Gerald, twenty-six thousand-! Where did you get that kind of money??  Just six quarters! He... he lost his house to the Native Americans. They don't care.   But how can they do that?! No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves!  How much do we have to raise, Mayor? Ohhh, never mind.   How can you do this to people? There's more to life than profits! Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff.  Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow. Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town. All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here.  It's in God's hand now.  We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  Oh hell yeah! Let it ride! Dammit! Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak. Stan? Okay? All right? Stan? Okay?  I'm sorry, Native Americans. Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes. It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over. We can stand here as long as it takes.   What do they want? You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you. Well, thanks.  How's your... mother? It's cool on my tongue. Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live. Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people. The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellow Creek. Now go. GO!  Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision?? Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone!  We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture. We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.  Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual. It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz? Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll. You're looking ultra-fabulous.  Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that. Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight. Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about? What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about. Oh really?! Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare. Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!  Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you! Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets! Oh my God, it's on fire!  I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants! Put it out! Put it out! Fire! Hey eses.  Stan, are you okay? Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths.  Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not ''that'' big a deal. Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue. Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away. Yes Dad. Yes I know.  Sharon, have you seen Dad? Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...  Oh My God! Get inside! Get inside!  Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?! The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!    GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF... GET OFF THE STREET! -STREETS!! OFF- GAAAAAH!!  Get over there! Stay low!  Shhhh!  AWWWW!! RUN!  Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!!  In here!  Quiet! Keep quiet!  Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to.  Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go.  Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now! You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?! We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry? Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did! What the hell is going on?! Dad, what are you doing?? This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!  Stan! Boys! You're safe! They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!  Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them! No, son. We... like to sleep in. They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGE ME!! Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over? Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does. Huh? Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a little. Let's just go home.  Who? Who are the Harrisons? Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?! We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.  All right, that does it! I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Harrison is, is a white guy, right?  God-damned religious kooks! Tell ''my'' son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass!  Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison? Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a- Uh, look, I just want to tell you that Well, thanks. Uh... Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son. You know. About... God, and stuff. Well, I... Well, no, no, I just... Y-you can call me... Randy. Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honest, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't}} even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem? Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night. Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America? Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion. All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon! One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening. We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening! And?  Your turn, Sharon. Yes. Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion. Ooo, what's that? Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion. Yeah!  I don't have a son! Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!  What? Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies.  Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right. Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters! That brave, brave man. Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school? There was no war months ago! Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah! Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday! Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us! And if it weren't for ''you'' people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China. All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club?  Oh yeah! blackjack table! Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards. All right, time to show these people how to gamble!  Ohh, not so good. Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand. I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem. Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out! The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.  Wha- what's in the cup?  Oh God. Oh Jesus.  Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass! How am I going to tell my family?    What, What did you say?  No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving! Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling a moving company right now!  Yeah! But wait.  Let it ride!! Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted.   Kyle! What's happened to you?? Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys. Oh, is the game on or something?  Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too??  What's that?  Kyle! You look terrible!  Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look. Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours! Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for?? Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already. It wasn't your life yesterday.  The answer is no, Kyle.  Kyle, what did you do?! Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused. We've gotta get out of here! They, they're... they're playing street hockey! Randy, what is this? Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you? We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  Yes? Yes, I can tell. I'm not sure. What? Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind. Look, Ike is ''our'' son now! Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and ''we're being hard on Peter?!'' Well you bet your ass it'll come to that! There's nothing I ''can'' do. Good-bye, Ike. You...  Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have. He's an inspiration to us all.  Is he going to be all right, doctor??  Oh baby baby, you can't die. Whoa. Easy, Kyle. I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light! What's the matter, sweetie? Oh dear. Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.  What is it, sweetie? Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with you. Boys, you have a little visitor.  Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty. Well you should've called Mommy. Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers? Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks! Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie? You too, Eric. That's a great idea, Chef.  Are you sure you got everything you need, young man? Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area. I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time. Oh shit! It's a trap! Muthafuckin Crips tryin' to smoke us all out! What the hell is goin' on here?   Hey little roller, try some of this chronic shit. Uhhh, how about domination of the world? Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels? Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, buddah. I'm not him. Ahh, don't shoot. I want to negotiate. Hey, relax!  Gah! Oh boy, General Disarray, may- maybe we just ought to stay outta this one. Make the first shot, punk! Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers!  You know, maybe he's right. I mean,  Come on! Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka! Yeah. Come on. Come on. Oh my Goddd!   What is that? You know, I've had it! You four boys ''never'' take art class seriously!  You think art is not important?  I certainly can! I'm your teacher! Make it two hours! Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished! Hello boys. Find everything you need?  Nice relaxing night at home, huh? Toilet paper  Now you kids be careful with this chewing gum. Don't go sticking it under tables. Okay. Toilet paper  ... Toilet paper  You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady? AAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAA! Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!  Whyyy? Whyyy? There we go. That should be about the last of it.  Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing? Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this. Look it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid. I was here. Officer, why would I TP my own house? It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal. You really have nothing better to do, do you? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!  Mommy! Mommy!  Mommy! Mommy! Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down. Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out!  Yeah, go kick his ass. We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please? Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k?  Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know- It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything. You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave. Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?  These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?! Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay? Well up yours, rednecks! Hey... That's a terrific idea! All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? . And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war. And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war.  What? The Founding Fathers would have protested like us! I guess we... owe you an apology.  Here she comes! Here she comes! We have plenty enough to save our town now! It's over, Stanley. What else can we do? But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.   I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?! What?? Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking! Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'!   Wait a minute, what? You're right, boys, m'kay? Crime scene investigation!   Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence. You?! So where were you last night at around 9?! Aha!! Got you! Insurance?  Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening. No I do not. I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think. Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police. I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case? Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return? You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.  Well, that's kind of personal. Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know. So you think there was more than one. Why? Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt!  Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  Is this toilet paper from your store?  Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days? Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern. Josh, I need your help. How do you mean? Yes. No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you? To get revenge. What do you mean? I don't have time for this, kid. Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps!  Oh. Of course! One of her students! Hello boys. How are you? It sure is! Right over here.  Why do you say that? All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by. Huh?? Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now.  Excuse me, everyone.  Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please? Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation.  Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no! Couldn't you have gone after him? Police station. Josh? Josh, where are you?! Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.  Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!  Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy? Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year.  He's a real monster. Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance.   were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?  That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual. And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?  Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.  Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?  Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them.  Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is.  Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?  Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man. The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it. Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted? Single-sheet? Why does one toilet-paper houses No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation. Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man? Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool house? Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art. Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make.  Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy.  No, sir. What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?   Hello Officer Barbrady. I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell. Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao.  Oh my God. It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now. Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who? Suspicious like how? Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store.  His parents are on their way down now. Well well well! I had to see it to believe it!  Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again! Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady. And that's your excuse?! Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber! O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago.   Girlfriend? Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.  You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay. I, don't know. Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money. Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside? You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession. What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house! Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister! Haven't you seen ''Queer Eye For the Straight Guy'', Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best. And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house. I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look. What? I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband. You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!! That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to. Oh Butters! What are you spending all that money on, Butters? You... have a girlfriend, Butters? Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?  All right, you win. Stephen, what is this place?  This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this. Little girl, you shouldn't be working here. No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer. ... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you. Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips. All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?  Get him out of here! Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.  Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski. All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.   Oh, Jesus Christ. Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?  J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids? Filthy bastard Native American money!  Well, you boys have certainly done it this time! Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now.  Come on in.  You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking! He... He was too fast for me. He ran out the door! Well, ah I'm covered in toilet paper. I'd look ''silly''.  Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me. Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?  Jesus! Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ. Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.  Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!  How did you do that? Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is? Unh, Jesus  Christ. Jesus Christ! Oh! Jesus Christ!  ''We got out of schoo-l! No more school toda-ay!'' No war! No war!  No war! No war! No war! Yeah! Right! Hahahaha, yeah.  No war! No war! No war! Booooo!! Protest! Rock-n-roll! Excuse me, boys.  Enter, young messenger.  I am John Hancock, President of the Congress. There you go! Now you look fabulous. Right. What about the war? Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay? Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say? Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in. Craig! Behave yourself! Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy. I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman. You don't... like us being metrosexual?  You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!  Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses! There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side.  Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.  That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago! Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out! We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle! See? I told you they had your son. Yeah! Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to ''support our troops'', right?!  Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first! Well excuse me if... <br><i>I'm a little bit country.</i> <i>I'm a little for supportin' our troops.</i> <i>I believe freedom isn't free.</i> <i>We must defend our country.</i> That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war! Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President. <i>Hey I'm a little bit country</i> <i>I'll be the muscle of America</i> Come on up here, everybody!  We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people.  Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore. So, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now. Put it out! Put it out! The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this! Eeeek! If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave! Well your side has the grocery store. Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs!  Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?! Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny! NOW! Eh-ah, I guess we owe ''you'' one. <i>We can be a nation that believes in war.</i> Sit down, Jer-Jer! ''Queer Eye For the Straight Guy'' is on. Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture. We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers! Hey hefe. You want some cerveza?  Yeah! Right!  Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops!  Support! Country! Awwwwww!  You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side of the town! Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store. W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs. All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better! Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!  Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank. It's a long shot. Let's go thirty one! Let's see it!  We'll never give up! You bastards!  Mr. Garrison, those are great pants. Uh, for what? No. Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt. Oh, why can't we all ''live'' at the mall?! We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these! Whoa, look out!   Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God! Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office. Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh. Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Awww.  Yeah! All right! Woohoo! Oh we did it! We did it! Oh my God! Oh this is amazing! Woohoo! Yeah!  AWWWWWWW!! All right! Yeah!  Woohoo! Your Tivo is full. Worthy young lad, are you all right? This year? Why it's 1776, it is. Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's house to get a very important document, I am. Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North? A flashback? Why, what is that? Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.  I'm afraid you'll have to wait here. Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry. Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers. But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane. Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.  Some favor going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost. Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger!  Now make haste! Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time. Yeah, that's right! Come on, guys! Get back to work! Mr. John Adams? Will you do the honors of reading the document to Congress, please?  Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue? And we will call that country the United States of America. Aye.   We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson.  We must go to war! We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!  It's like having your cake, and eating it, too. Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England? Yeehaw! But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy. Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want!  We cannot found a country based on war! Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it. England will only understand one thing: Force.  Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another. Yeah, because you don't care about the fate of the Colonies like ''we'' do! You're all unpatriotic! And if you don't like the Colonies, then you can get out! Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers! Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.  What's wrong with Gerald? What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go? Oh hi Gerald, Sheila. Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV. Don't our men look  Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures. And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever. You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great. Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?! This is crazy!  That does it! I can't take it anymore! Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do!  There they are! Get 'em! We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't. Oooh, Hi Dad. He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center. Every senior in town will be driving home... Oh, hi Stan. Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people. Where are you going? Randy, don't cause trouble. So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass? What are you talking about? Stanley, what did you do this time?! No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker!  Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble! Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!  Rabble! I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both? And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless. The-the child! The child, from the hospital. <i>We're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll</i> <i>For the war, against, the war, WHO CARES?? One hundred episodes!</i> Jennifer Lopez? Yeah! Yeah!

Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape. All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen.  What kind of song do you want? You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best! Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see it.  Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me? If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do. All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain. No, dude! You can't say "I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms." Hey, can we get more coffee over here?  Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains. Look at that. Another tortured soul. Hey Raven, check it out.  That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want. Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale! She's fantastic. Who is she?  Yeah, but she's younger and spicier. No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo. Ah, Ms. Lopez, come on in. Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopez, we regret to inform you that, uh... we're dropping you from the label. Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records. Whatever. Look, it's nothing personal, we just think you need to move on. Gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit. We'll sue you! Get her out of here! You're not?  Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer Lopez. We wanna thank you for all your hard work and ..."talent". Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado now, but uh I believe she originally from Mexico, just like you. All right, Ms. Lopez, take it from the top.  Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on!  Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists!  And what do we do about the small town of South Park that lies in the highway's way?  That makes sense. She reminds me of J-Lo. I don't think J-Lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl. Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous. Uh, that's fine Ms. Lopez. Look, it's been a long night. Why don't we pick it up in the morning? Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session!  Ms. Lopez! Up here! You die, pigs!    Yo, make it quick. I got a video shoot at two and a script reading at five. What? Oh no you di'n't!  You can't drop me! I'm Jennifer Lopez! How can you drop me?! Who the hell is this other Jennifer Lopez?! Where is ''she'' come from?! I don't come from no Mexico! I'm Puer'ah Rican! Terrible, Ben! Some girl in Colorado is trying to become the new Jennifer Lopez!   Yo driver. Stupid driver! Take me to South Park, Colorado! I'm gonna kill that bitch!! Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!   You go' a problem?! Then who?  What the hell is that?! That? That's what replaced me?!  You fucking smartass, who do you think you are?! Fuck you!  You'd better stop! Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny!  You'd better stay away from him!   That's what you said about me, asshole! Fuck you!  Ow. Look out, muffinhead! Get a what with who?  This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working at a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!  How'd it go, baby? What?? Who could replace ''you''??  Come on, Jenny, let's go. We should be getting back to the...  Hey, I was wondering if I could talk to Ms. Lopez. Jenny? Yes, Jenny, eheh, it's me! Where are you? Please, I-I have to see her!  Jenny, ah Jenny I just can't stop thinking about you.  I've been meaning to write a song or a poem, but I have no talent. Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car? Let's spend the whole day together! Jenny, I have to tell you something. I... I think I love you. But what?  Jenny, can I kiss you? Mmm, just like tacos. You're so hot, baby. Mm, yeah.  Oh God, Jenny! But I love her! Jenny! Jenny, I'll call you! Good morning, baby. Should we tell him the news? It's S'aright? We're getting married!! There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby!  Don't you hurt her!  Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight! Our love is like rain! Wow, really? Wow, cool!  Hey dudes.  Wow, Ben Affleck. Wendy breaks up. Wendy breaks up with you.  She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends.  Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes! God, you're so stupid!  Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of. If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel. Freeze, leafblower!  All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath. Shut up, picante pants! Who's Mitch Conner? Well, looks like Mitch Conner has cashed in his last chips.  Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'. I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time. Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart.  Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce will go on.  Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people. Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later? Yeah. Meee too. Yes?  Oh, hello, boys. Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now. I'll do that. Have fun, boys.  Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well. A dog parade?   Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son? We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  And she's... a... girl, right? Well all right! Good for you, Butters! Oh, hello there boys. Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something! Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool.  And later, when I went to get it, it was gone. Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids. My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie? Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching?? All right, all right, you you boys run along now. Fine, here, just go!  Well, what do you think happened, little detectives? Is this the South Park Crime Unit? I lost my dolly. If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost.  She has curly blonde hair. And a wed dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue bow in her hair.  My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. Oooh, I love it! It's payback time!  We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys. All right, let's do this by the books! McDonnell,  Agent Tucker, FBI! And you? ...Not anymore, you're not! Can't we? You guys are playing Detectives. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you! I want choppers on the roof ready to go!  Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.  This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of. And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way!  The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you! No you're not. Climb off, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules! Yes it does so!  Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll. Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh, me and Doctor... Flick here just need to... check your vagina.  Yeah, that's gay.  Huh huh who is it?!    If you don't get out of here, we're gonna rip the doll's head off! We were playing gynecologists and now we're playing criminals. We're gay. No you didn't! No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.   We're dead. That's gay.  That's gay.  Yeah. That's gay. Huhuh.    That's gay. Well you boys are little heroes. I'm going to call the police department and let them know what brave little detectives you are!  Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll. Well, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Junior Detectives.  That means you boys are now an official part of the department. All right, so ready for your first assignment? Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!  One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle worth sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixty thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass! You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't even have guys to question now, because you killed them all! One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers! What the hell is the problem here?? Then hit the showers, all of you!  Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado. The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover.  What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin' you one last chance! You're good cops, but you let your emotions get in the way! And your little "shoot first ask questions later" technique has no place in this century! Now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books, you got it?! The mayor is on my ass and blablablah!  God damnit! Those junior detectives and their heroically reckless ways! Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there!  Christ! Those junior detectives have no regard for the law!   Who the hell are you?? Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation. But that's not fair!  All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight! I do not agree with your methods! You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent! But by God you get the job done. Congratulations! I'm probably going to regret this, but, well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. There'll be lots of action, and that big paycheck you've always wanted.  Well well well, if it isn't the super-cops.  Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes? Yeah! Who the hell are you to change that?! That's right. Come on, bring it! They're lying. Come on, you guys. Leave them alone.  Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house?? Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that?  You think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it? LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side? Why don't you and your rookie friends ''make us'' No problem, sir. No problem at all. So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant? Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money. They're dead! That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these "super-cops" joined the force.  That's right.  I think we'll take a hundred percent now. That's right.  I said, back off Murphy!  Great job, boys. You found the meth boss!  A deal? Boys! Down!   It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got what they deserved. If it weren't for you boys, we would have never cleaned up the department. Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!  Would you like a dance?  Anyone like a dance?  Dance? Anyone like a dance? Dance??? Anybody like a dance???  Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's hear it for Candy! Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca.  Whoa whoa, what the hell are you kids doin' in here? This isn't an appropriate place for children.  Oh, really? Let's go see. Hey Gino, these kids say they know you. I didn't think so. All right, you kids- All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and- What? Ha-I don't know no kids. Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family? What? Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal. That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty! Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids before, man. These kids are 5-0! These kids are cops, man!  Now we've gotta kill you all. Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let anybody know about our partnership. Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business like this, sometimes partnerships need to end. Get me a hard line to the phone! And I want choppers on the roof!  Agent Fields, FBI! Not anymore, you're not. Is so! Is so!  Welcome to the Three Feathers Casino. I'm your host, Chief Runs With Premise. Please try your luck at one of our many games. Halt.  I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor. You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.  Awww, I think I'm going to cwy. What are they doing? Impossible! Thirty one. Black.  No... NOOO!   Welcome to the blackjack table. May luck run through you, like the spirit of the buffalo. Dealer, twenty one.  Sorry. Thank you for playing at Three Feathers. May your life be filled with the song of the sparrow. Gerald, this is ten dollars a hand! Well I don't wanna play here! There's daddy! Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over. Gerald, what are you talking about? Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch! Boys, that's ridiculous. My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days. It is? I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...  Kyle! What happened to you?! WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew? Gerald! Gerald, get down here! The boys at school beat him up, Gerald. Kyle! Kyle, don't belittle your own people! Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.  Okay, boys. Get in the car.  Oh, hello Chris, Linda. That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday. I'll drive you boys.  Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  He's okay. Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you! Smoking? Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault. No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them ''wanna'' smoke. We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner. So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke? Well then, you are grounded, mister! Gerald, what the hell is going on? Well, we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gintz, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again. Are you crazy?! The new Canadian Prime Minister? I think you'd better leave. No! Gerald, do something!  Many moons ago, Pony and Eagle walked up to Coyote. Pony said to Coyote, "I am very mad at Eagle. Will you yell at him for me?" Coyote said to Pony, "Why can you not yell yourself?" And Pony replied, "Because I am a little horse."  Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!  A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino!  Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits. Well like what? Get out of our way. Boys. It isn't your town anymore. Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with! This isn't over!  What is the state of our people? Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land. I already have a plan how we can force them off their land... sneakily.  Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS.  Okay, bring them in!    Though I know we have differences, we believe that a compromise can be reached. In the meantime, it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold. Will you not take this offering as a gesture of good-will?  Please. As a token of good faith. It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh. Oh. You're welcome. How much longer must we wait for our superhighway?? Then I suppose we must be patient. What is the matter, wife? Premise Running Thin, what is the matter? No! I told you not to touch them! This would not have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe! Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth!  Your, your SARS. Where did it go? My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well.  You... you can cure him? You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino.  All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back. Their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo. Well your way of life is about to change, little boys. Now move!  They were! Yes, and Eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day. But they are determined and proud. And the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force, it could be a publicity nightmare, further hurting our net assets. Blankets? SARS has spread throughout the entire town of South Park, Chief Runs with Premise. Their wills will break soon. It is amazing. All our plants and herbs failed to heal him.  Yes, but we have milked these simple mountain folk almost dry. If we really want to see cash flow, we need to bring in city-people from Denver.  There you are, sir. There's the check for your home. Just sign here, and here. Last night I spoke with the spirit of the bear, and Bear said that if we do not build our highway soon, our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino. But your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart. Perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life. Ha ha ha ha! Free blanket? Free blanket? Free blanket... Yeah, this is our town! Yeah, we're a team! South Park is saved.  Yeah! They don't own our town! We do! Yeah! South Park is ours. Thanks to you, we're all safe now, Stan. Well, I guess we all learned that South Park is more than just a town. It's a community that nobody can split up. Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and do the guest voice thingy. Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Jill! Yeah! HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha! We can save the town and be super-rich! Two, red. You lose. There you go. Have a nice day.  And what are four little boys going to do to stop us, huh?  Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too.  Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of good-will towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it.  It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for. Coming up next, choosing the right hair conditioner. What you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle.  Tom, we're now entering the second day of the rock band MOOP's refusal to play, and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on. In a recent poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the Internet. One percent said yes. Two percent said no. And ninety-seven percent said, "Who the hell is MOOP?!" Back to you, Tom. Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike is growing! As I'm speaking, more musicians are arriving! It looks like Alanis Morissette, Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens of others are going to join MOOP in not playing music. This is a veritable Strikapalooza! Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.  What? Your coming was foretold to me. You've come to save our people. Come in.  Watch the cats. Me?? Huh, no. I am just a guide. Sit down.  You must find the answer yourself, by taking an inward journey.  Let the voices of our ancestors show you the way.  Runs with Premise, come quickly! It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick. He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS! Well, how do ''you'' know he didn't? The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they? Papa. Papa...  I have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life. But nothing seems to be working.  We have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts! What can I say? We're fabulous. Especially in those pants.  Now you know the truth! Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over! That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket.  Geraaald! Hi Gerald. Okay, sweetums.  You guys look pretty gay.  Not as gay as us, though. Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay! Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags!  HA! Told you you guys were straight! I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite.   Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend! Take your non-flaming ass to some other school!  Everyone knows it's true! Is so!  Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are. Yeah, little bitch! You're straight!  My pleasure, silly-buns. Why? Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight. Oh my God! Huh? Yeah. When was the last time you had a manicure, straight man?  What?! We don't ''have'' a bass guitar.  Hey, there ''was'' a bass guitar in my basement. So, what are we doing?  I don't know how to play bass.  I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes! God-damnit!  Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?  This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!   Why the hell would I be looking way over there?? Cartman, what the hell is all this? But you spent all the money we made! Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band. Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience! What?! How did that happen? Yeah, let's see that hair.   This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man! You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look. That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong. Sorry Charlie, no sale.  For a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished by man in the Kindling Wars. Now, we've got to do something with your hair. That looks great! Now, how about some moisturizer.  What?  Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps.  You just had to push it, didn't you?! And your nails are filthy. Let's get those clean.  You're going to New York alone? Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes. I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad. What the hell did that show do to them? Guys, you've done a terrific job. ''Queer Eye For the Straight Guy'' is our number one show!  You guys are changing the world! And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States! What? We didn't order any room service. Carol?  This is gay gold!  Oh my God, what are they doing?!  Wha? What have you done? Well you're going to jail for thi-!  What is that? Oh my God. They were crab people. I should have known they were crab people. They tried this before with ''The Jeffersons''. Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad. Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint.  Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV! Just had to keep asking question! Ooooo. Oh no, errrr! NO! Yeah!! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! We are the Crab People!  Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!  Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!. Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!  See now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years! But soon we shall rule the land above, and mankind will be gone! When all the world is metrosexual, the crab people shall finally reign supreme!!  No! Our evil plans! Noooo...  Crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force, and so we came up with our perfect plan!   If you can't beat man,  change man! Taste like crab, talk like people. They cannot see or hear us, foolish man. Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helpless!! Oh noooo!!  Freeze!! FBI!!  Down on the ground! Down on the ground!   Hurry up! Let me see those hands!  Move move move move move move! All clear, men!  Get your ass going! Move move move move move move! Move! Shut up!!  You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downloaded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?  Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your coats on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica.  This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.   The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal? That is the folly of man. Now look in this window.  I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise.  Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury. It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson. If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees. Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!  All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him. All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him. Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters.  I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts!  All right, kid! End of the line! Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it? Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week. Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage. Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm! Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith. Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics. The revolution?  Yeah, and we're gonna ask for more money in Medi-Care, too! That's right. And we want more money in Medi-Care! Open the Country Kitchen Buffet for us!  Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity!  All right, Christians, how are you feeling tonight?  Let's keep this salvation train going with the hot band, Sanctified! Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change. Give it up for ... Faith + 1!  Yeah Jesus! My ears are bleeding! Hey is this the way to the backstage? We're the band Sanctified. We play metal and punk, but with lyrics that inspire faith in Christ. You bet your gosh-darned rear end we are! Always good to be praying before you're playin'. Yeah. We proved that Christian music can be tough and hard core. Sent down from Heaven! The Spirit and the Glory! Well, that, that's cool.  All right, uhh, Sanctified, you guys are up next.  That's Faith + 1. Yeah! Let's do it! Praise Jesus! Praise him! My Lord!  Hey, are you the guys protesting free Internet music downloading? That's right. Metallica is behind you dudes a thousand percent! We're gonna sit here and protest with you until free downloadin' stop, hyeah! Guys, we here at Faith Records were very moved by your performance at Christfest. You're one of the most talented Christian rock bands we've ever heard!  We just have one question, though. We were looking over some of your lyrics, uh... "I want to walk hand-in-hand with Jesus on a private beach for two./I want him to nibble on my ear and say 'I'm here for you.'" It...it seems you ''really'' love Christ. Eh no but it appears you are actually... in love with Christ.   Well uh of course I do. I mean I just- Uh, we'd just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for God, and not for the money. That's- all we needed to know. Just, sign here and we'll get your album sold. According to the letter, sir, the town has a tobacco company quite near them.  ''I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!'' Yeah, if we all give in now, people might ''never'' stop downloading our music for free! But why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars? ...We're just about the money. Yeah, yeah. We like to praise Christ! Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the Christian Recording Industry is pleased to present you with this Myrrh album.  Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh. Congratulations! No, but you can go double myrrh.   Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain. But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus. Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver.  It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple "man walks into a bar" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again.   Ooooh, I think I hit a pothole.  I don't remember there being a building here.  How the hell did we get up here?   I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill! And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II! And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive! Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell! That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re- That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell! So now, what are we gonna do about it? That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite! ...Oh, right, this ''is'' the meeting.  All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime. Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around. God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides! Okay, all set?  Eh?  Go around. Go around, you moron! I ain't got one! You peckers took it! You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try! Stupid son of a- God damnit! Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch! Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve. Kiss my sagging ass! Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP! The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!  Yes? Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill. Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now! Isn't that a little extreme, Bill? The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now! All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station. We want our licenses back! Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back. Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile? That's right. I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families. Sure. I'll drive. Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet! You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet! There's Country Kitchen right there! Right there! You're gonna miss it!  I think so. Oh, I'd better get my other sweater.  Yeah. And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk! You have to let us in!  No, but it's the shortest. I save the most gas that way.  Less miles means less gas, you old fool.  Where? Is this the parking lot? Another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, who were trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in Deer Creek, where three construction workers and a bulldozer , who was trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public outcry is forcing the DMV to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy, though no decision has yet to be made.  Yeah!  Yeah! Yeah! That's right, Pete!  Yeah! Yeah! That's right!  Me too! Yeah, that's right! And mine too!  Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's gotta stop them!  I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question! I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question! They are?? They can't do that!  So long, everybody.  We need to let everyone know we're pissed off, and we're not gonna take it anymore!   Oh, I remember! They're gonna take our licenses away! It ain't right what you're doin'! I never had an accident in my life! Do about what? Great idea, Marvin! They're gonna take our licenses away. Wait, ah I think we're having that meeting right now. Right. To get those damn kids to stop skateboarding on the sidewalks! Goodbye, Missy.   I told you to turn left, Larry. I told you this was the wrong way! AAAHH!! AAAAAAAHH!!   We're sorry, but this is the only way to be sure. Next please.  There we go. Well, maybe you should be in a nursing home. Hmmm? Well, we can certainly help you with that, too. That's right. You shouldn't punish all of us.  But how am I supposed to get to the grocery store? Or the pharmacy to buy medicine? Some of us would rather die! We aren't second-class citizens! That's right! You can take our licenses, but you'll never take our pride! Yeah... Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over! Could I see your license, please? Well then, I have to take you to jail. I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh. Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team to Point Delta! Marvin Marsh? I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP. Hu-we've come to help the seniors in this town fight back.  It's the nursing home! Liberate our comrades! Help this!  We're taking control of the town! The revolution is on!   That's right.  Bravo Team is go.  Move! Move! Move!   Put your hands up, young man!  Seniors, we're taking the town over. Shut your piehole and get over there!  Reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in Conifer. Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We just had to stop by Country Kitchen Buffet first. Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!  We'll tell them if they ''don't'' give us our demands, we'll start killin' hostages!  No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs! Good! Hell, us senior citizens could take over the entire country! Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business.  Heh?? All right everyone, round up your ammunition and get ready to move! We're takin' this war further out!  Heck no! This is goin' too well. We're gonna take the whole country back. Wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five!  Huh? What is this?! It's 6 a.m. C-Country Kitchen should be open! No...  Let us in! Let us in!  Country Kitchen... wha-what happened? There now, Mr. Johnson.  Can I help you? Well, alright, well it's about damn time!   Mrs. Wyland, seniors are taking over the town. Would you like a gun? Oh, I suppose so.  Have you all got Alzheimer's? The-they're not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens. Huh, right. They're gonna really believe that.    Attention seniors: lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over! What do you want?  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Two hostages come front and center! .  All right! It's not open? It has to be!  Open the door! It's six a.m.  Try a window.  They're blocked from the inside. All right everyone, area secure. Collect their weapons and free the hostages.  It's up to the townspeople. Everything is fine. Control of the town is back to you folks.  Sir, what should we do with this one?  I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita. ''Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. [they pass a missing person's billboard with Butters on it and South Park PD's phone number]''. Hello?  With what? No? Kid, what are you doin' here? Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump. No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week. Hello everybody. It's really great to meet you all. I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!  Hey. My name's Gary.  That's funny. You're cool, man.  Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!  Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me? Excuse me? How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid.  Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it. It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are ''really'' cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites. The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday. Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.  And this is my brother Mark.  My sister Jenny. My little brother Dave. And my baby sister Amanda. That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that? Can pass the test.  Yeah! You know... the book that Joseph Smith found. Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad. Awesome! I can't wait! You coming, Stan? Bye!  Hey Stan. Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front. Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along?  Oh here comes my family now! Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much! So what do you guys wanna do? Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow. So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great! Sure. Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon. Hey everybody.  Hey Stan. Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want! Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!  Hey Stan. Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore. Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in ''this'' town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls.  Okay, my turn.  Hi Stan! Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan! Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan! Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world??  All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon! All right, you rascals. Gather round.  Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s. And we all know what happened then, don't we? Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor! Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan.  Gary! Great to see you! Hi! All right! Let's play!  All right! Go Dave! Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs?  That's a great story, Sarah. All right! Woohoo! OOWW! Only the most important person in the world. I'm a lion.  We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh. Let's go.   Wow, what a great house! Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith. Hey! Oh yeah! You've never heard of him? Yeah!  I'm an alien.   And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest. Hi!  You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?  Hello Stan! My family! Woohoo!  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right. There goes that kooky Joseph Smith. You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus. Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it. You see? You believe it now? Found what? Well it's true. I did. I was out in the woods, praying  And that's exactly how it happened.  Oh my gosh! A...  But your skin is white. ''[looks at the camera] '' Jesus live here in America? Wooww...  I found them! I found them!  You're not gonna believe it, everybody! I found them! Another New Testament of Jesus Christ! Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look. . Maybe there ''isn't'' anything out here.  Wow... . This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites! Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon. Where are what? Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it! Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret? I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America. It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs. With these.   They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here.  I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light. Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you. Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. "And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites." I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages. Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently. Where? Well yeah, sure. Why would he make that up? I am Moroni. I am a Native American. Yes. Long ago all Native American were white. We all came to America from Jerusalem. And while we were here we were visited by Christ. Yes. Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel, and as punishment, God turned their skin red. These are the Native Americans you know today.  There is an ancient book buried near here, written on gold plates that account my people's lives. Also buried with the book are two seer stones, the Urim and Thummim, which will allow you to translate the writings. Find it, and fulfill your destiny.  ''Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb'' Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb. ''Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb'' ''Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb'' ''Martin Harris dumb dadumb-'' ''Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb'' ''Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.'' Bye Stan! Shut up, turd! We're watching ''Friends''! I said shut up, turd! I wanna watch TV. My brother is a stupid turd. Me neither. Hello! I sure am.  The, the name's Gary. Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here! Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares. I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over. Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him. Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry. You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said "Who the heck do these people think they are?!" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again. To each his own, right? Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be. Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be?  Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan? Yeah. Have a good time, boys.  Ohohoho, really? Well, that's just because he hasn't heard the ''best part'' about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real! Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat? See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home. And that's how it happened. Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it? Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs. Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!  Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you! With chocolate frosting  I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing. We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious! Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us. Look, we painted our faces!  Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.  You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet you! Uh huh? What? What did he say? Are you crazy? Wow, amazing! Hey you guys!  Yeah! Woohoo! Well, sure I can. In America?  Really? That sounds kind of... Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it? Rocks? Really? Wow!  A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book. Why would he make it up? Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem.   Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.  He is?? Wow! If God got angry with you, then you ''must'' be tellin' the truth. All right, Martin. Let's get to work!  Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates? All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these. Yeah! All right! Woohoo!! Kyle!  Randy! Pam! Woohoo!  ''Butt out! Yeah yeah! Give that cigarette butt a throw!'' ''Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!''  Hey students, how are we all feelin' today? Woooo!  Blow smoke? Us? No way! Because we don't need to smoke and neither do you, right kids? Butt out! Break it down!  Vernon!   Hey, did you guys know that each year over six hundred thousand people a year die from smoking? A year!  Freestyle!  Don't smoke! Don't ever smoke! And what about abortion, and AIDS?  Yeah. So butt out!  Remember, kids, if you smoke, you could grow up to be a failure. B to the U to the T to the T to the O to the U to the T to the C to the I to the G to the A to the R to the E to the T to the T to the E! Butt out, cigarette! Hey! What's the big deal? I like smoking, and it makes me cool!  So don't believe what those evil tobacco companies tell you!  ... you gotta get it! What about emphysema?? Is that cool??  Pfft! That's none's the cool. Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-  Dooooonttt smooooke. Oh, really?? Do you think lung cancer is cool, too??  Word. Worse yet, you could grow up to be dead.   Don't they know the hazard of second-hand smoke? Yeah, that must be it.  This is war!!  Butter!!   Alright kids, here's what we're gonna do.  Once you're inside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. Got it? Uh, we're just leveling out the playing field.  Excuse me! Would you mind putting that death stick out?! Isn't smoking illegal in bars here? Oh my God! What kind of backward hick state is this?! Well when I relax I just go to my vacation house in Hawaii! Your vacation house in Mexico, then, whatever it is! Look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! And I'm not gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking in bars in Colorado! There will be no more smoking here!  As soon as we get into the main facility, I'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! Think you can handle it? Heh, great.  Okay, now watch yourselves, kids. These tobacco company people will do ''anything'' to get you hooked on smoking. They are ''liars'' and they are ''frauds''!  Yes. My name is Rita Poon. I called about my boys wanting a tour. Oh. Hello, Mr. Harris.  Not if I were around, they wouldn't have. Oh, nothing! Please continue. Oh, here boys. Let me get your picture.  Got it! Ha! You bastards are going down now! I'm not Rita Poon! I'm Rob Reiner!  Hoh boy, that was great, kids. Hah, you see that? They got into your head. Now you kids can meet some good, decent people, the folks who work to get smoking banned!  We go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop!   You kids need to understand something, okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like, when you know what's good for people more than they do. What?!  God-damnit, what the hell is wrong with people in this state?! Well they want proof?! All right, we'll give them proof! Boys, I need one of you to act in a commercial for us! We'll shoot it tomorrow! And you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. All right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's go! Okay Eric, this is going to be real simple. All you gotta do is read the words on the Teleprompter here.  Let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this.  All right, roll camera. Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever you're ready, Eric. And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up, people. That was fantastic.   Give us the child! There, you see that?! The tobacco company won't give us the kid! And do you know why?! Because they know that if they give us that kid, then we'll kill him! And when our commercial goes on the air, it will lose them business! Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it!  Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay! God-Damnit There'll be no more smoking!!  I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups! My goo! My precious goo!  Yes? But, uh, this is a bar. Look man, I work fourteen hours a day at the saw mill. I just got off work and I need to relax.  I ain't got a vacation house in Hawaii! Yeah. Let smokers smoke. Not in Colorado.  Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon. My name's Kevin Harris and I'm the vice president of Big Tobacco. Well, come on in.  Native Americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant. They smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. Excuse me? The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612.  Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports. That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields.  when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about. And here's our factory at work.  Well, I guess that's the end of our tour. What??  Oh my God! We will not!  Mr. Reiner, your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didn't pass. Apparently, several people here still believe there's no proof second-hand smoke can kill you. That was very good, Eric. Here, eat this cupcake. But you are. Just eat this one cupcake. It has... sprinkles. Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him. Yeah? Well tell Stan to fuck off!!  Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of you?   Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you.  So you guys having a good time today? Oh Yeah!  Uh huh...

I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists. Another life of pain.  Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is. Yeah. My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school. Whoa. Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades." Go away Mom! Leave me alone! You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face. Conformist bitch. For sure. Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels? They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists cheerleaders.  Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you. First of all, there's a five foot rule.

Ma nayim vi-tov.'' My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption.  We were told that you might be the- It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby. We want to take Peter home, to Canada. Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home. He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind. Please, don't make things any harder for Peter. We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that! Come on, Peter, we should get going.  I have some chocolate. We're going to take good care of him.  Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way.  Peter!  Peter, it's Mommy. So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good to see him. I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back. Yes! Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy. Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family. I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents. Yes! Excuse me?  Uh, is this an invasion?  Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you! That's Scott! He's a dick Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone! The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa.  Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick! ''Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends loves you!''<br />''We're just like any other country without the big tattoo!'' His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there. It's Scott! AAAAHHHH!  <i>You're off to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!</i> Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.  We greet thee with pleasure, but one question, if we may?  What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today? Get him!   Hey! What the hell is going on?! Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!  A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now! This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!!   Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!  Ey! What are you doing?! What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?! You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you! Who the hell are you?! Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!!  Not so fast!  Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?! Haha, you lose, Americans! God, what a dick! Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road. This is Canada. We only have one road.  <i>Follow the only road.</i> <i>And it's paved and wide and up to code.</i> Ahoy there, travelers. I am Rick, the proud Canadian Mountie.  Baaaah. Baaaah.  Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride... You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you. Follow me this way! ''We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!'' All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada. Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd.  Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place! We must be very close now. Waaaah! You're a dick, Scott! Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie! Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is ''that'' way.  It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!  Is it working? Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time! Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses. Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein! Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back! Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style! Honh honh honnnh! Welcome to French Canada. Well first you must answer that phone.  Ring-ring. Ring-ring. You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call!  Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine. Honh honnnh! Very good! Let us make haste! Is a bullshit Canada ''I think you'd understand.'' ...You understand. It reminds me of death and fear. Oh no. It's Scott. Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away. Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland right! Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there.  Ze Prime Minister is inside. Oh well, so much for zat.  And we won't get our wine. Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before. And we can drink our wine. We have everything your heart could desire. Trapezes. Trampolines. And lots and lots of cheese.  Would you like a moustache?  How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie! ''If you lived here for a day, you'd understand.'' [the small group leaves the town behind]  Not so fast, Scott! I'm Steve the Newfoudlander. And you're on Newfoundland property now! Get off before I have you arrested! Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal. Yeah, sure, except there's just one problem. You folks are goin' the wrong way. Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.  Of course, we could always take my boat, eh? Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister.  Here we are at the Parliament buildin'. Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh?  And we can't perform sodomy, eh? And I can sodomize me boys again Yes? Ha! Impossible! The new Prime Minister isn't seeing anybody!   Yes?  The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business. So you might as well go home. Good-bye!  Oh please! Please stop crying. All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here. Yes yes. Come in.  I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want? That is a great speech, guy. But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever! I SAID GO!  I am the Prime Minister of Canada.  Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend. Saddam Hussein? He was fooling us?
