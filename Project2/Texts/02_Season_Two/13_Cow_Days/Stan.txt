Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy. Really? What's that? What the hell was that? Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?! Yeah, this line is way too long! Here we go. What ride? My ass we will! Yeah, let's not ride that ride again. We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again. Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls? Sorry, Officer Buttbaby. Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say? This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.  He really wants those dolls. Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman. We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. How long was that? Damn it! That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that. What are you going to do? Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Hold on, Cartman! Come on, Cartman. You okay, dude? Cartman, hello? Hel-lo? What's the matter with him. But can he still ride a bull? Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me? What?! Oh, he's fine, dude. Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo. How's he doing? Do you think he can ride the bull? Cool. Jesus, dude! Oh, hell! Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride. Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!  There he is! Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours! Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this. I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull. Dude, that bull's gonna kill him. Oh my God, they killed Kenny! We did it, dude, we did it! Yeah. And we have $5000 this time. Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? We should- Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!  Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh. Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling? Oh-h. Nowhere.
