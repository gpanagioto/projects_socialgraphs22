Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are. Huh? I'm not fat.  Hey, I'm ''not fat'', you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned. So I don't get to be on the team now?  Right here. For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit!  Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.
