Hm, that sounds pretty good. Hey Kenny!  Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povich freak show is on. Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so ''we'' can win a prize! What disease should we say?  This is gonna be so funny! We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you ''think'' we were talkin' about? It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.   Where's you get the balls from? Wow! All right, the original AVID cut of ''Star Wars: Episode I'' That's your flight, Butters. Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV. Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend!  Here he comes. But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!  Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you? Yeah, they wanted to find you bad. I- told them where to find you. Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over.
