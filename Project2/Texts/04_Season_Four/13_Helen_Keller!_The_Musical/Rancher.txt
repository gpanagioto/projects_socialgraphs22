What kind of turkey are you lookin' for? Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all.   Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter. Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head. Fifty bucks. I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot. I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too.
