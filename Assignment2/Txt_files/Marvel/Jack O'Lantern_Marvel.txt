'''Jason Macendale''' was a [[mercenary]] who was recruited out of college and trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and various para-military organizations. Considered a liability due to his violent nature and amoral personality, this rejection turned Macendale to a career mercenary and ultimately a costumed terrorist. He adopted the Jack O'Lantern alter ego, engaging in combat with [[Machine Man]] as his first opponent<ref>''Machine Man'' #19.

After his co-conspirator's supposed death, all known copies of Goblin weapons and costumes were handed over to Macendale who took over the '''Hobgoblin''' identity in order to steal notoriety within the supervillain community.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Macendale was exposed by the Kingpin's organization and fought a battle against Spider-Man which was meant to prove his abilities but was foiled. To add to the embarrassment, Spider-Man was obviously drunk when they fought and still won.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Deciding he needed abilities like the original Green Goblin and Hobgoblin if he was to have a similar reputation, Macendale attempted to steal the Goblin secret formula for superhuman strength. After failing to do so, he intimated [[Harry Osborn]] by threatening Osborn's [[Liz Allen|loved]] [[Normie Osborn|ones]] for wanting the Goblin formula,<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #47. Marvel Comics.</ref> resulting in a confrontation between himself and the second Green Goblin where Macendale was overcame.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #312.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Enhanced by the demon's power but horrified as his handsome face transformed into a demonic one, Macendale blamed his suffering on Spider-Man and Osborn. He hunted Spider-Man down for revenge. With his demonic powers, Macendale defeated Spider-Man easily but [[Mary Jane Watson]] intervened before he could deliver the killing blow.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Having finally been made into the notorious supervillain he hoped to be at the cost of his humanity, Macendale put his personal enmity for Spider-Man aside and used his demonic powers to be a top contract killer. He offered his mercenary services to [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to eliminate [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] but is stopped by Spider-Man and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161.

Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As an independent mercenary and criminal, Macendale would clash with many other heroes, including [[Darkhawk]],<ref>''Darkhawk'' #1-3.

Macendale was defeated once more by Spider-Man along with [[Coldheart (comics)|Coldheart]] during an attempt to kidnap Macendale's long-lost son. However, Macendale's reunion would be an unhappy one as Macendale attempted (unsuccessfully) to use his son as a hostage to avoid going back to jail. He would remain in jail for some time before being freed by Gaunt, combating against the second [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man]]. In exchange for doing Gaunt's bidding, the scientist turned Macendale into a cyborg such as the removal of Macendale's left eye with a new high-tech cybernetic eye. He failed and was once again arrested.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #68-69. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Considered "just a criminal" by Spider-Man, Macendale was viewed as a typical (sociopathic) thug who is not much of a threat as his predecessor and [[Norman Osborn]] in comparison.<ref name="Legacy of Evil">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek, Kurt]] | penciller = [[Mark Texeira|Texeira, Mark]] | inker = [[Mark Texeira|Texeira, Mark]]| title = Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil | issue = #1 |date = June, 1996| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Macendale went on trial for his many crimes and found guilty on several counts (including convictions for the original Hobgoblin's acts), disgustingly responding by revealing that Leeds was his predecessor. His continued testimony leads Spider-Man recounting encounters with the original Hobgoblin, and thus realized that Ned cannot possibly be the supervillain due to lack of powers (despite being killed when Macendale paid the Foreigner).<ref name="Wolverine">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | penciller = [[M.

A later version of Jack O'Lantern is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; this individual used several false aliases including Jason Macendale, Maguire Beck ([[Mysterio]]'s cousin), and Mad Jack (Daniel Berkhart).

The second version of Jack O'Lantern was introduced as an enemy of [[Captain America]] and [[Spider-Man]].

This version of the character was subjected to much controversy, due to the fact that several years after his introduction he was rebranded "Mad Jack" and was heavily featured in the pages of ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' during the late 1990s. Mad Jack was ultimately revealed to be the duo of Daniel Berkhart (ex-Mysterio) and Maguire Beck (Mysterio's cousin). It was not until the one-shot ''New Avengers Most Wanted'' (a character compendium) that the second iteration was confirmed as a separate entity: '''Steven Mark Levins'''. However, the character's name would not be used in-story until ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 5 #10 (2007).

This incarnation was a professional criminal, and a partner of [[Blackwing (character)|Blackwing]]. Alongside Blackwing, he searched Skullhouse and first battled Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #396-397. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Blackwing, he was then admitted as a provisional member of the loosely knit band of the [[Red Skull]]'s operatives called the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]].<ref>''Captain America'' #398. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Soon after that, Jack O'Lantern fought [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], and captured Diamondback.<ref>''Captain America'' #405-408</ref> Diamondback tried to escape, and Jack O'Lantern fought Diamondback in mid-air.<ref>''Captain America'' #409</ref> He was ultimately defeated in combat by the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and taken to the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America'' #410. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He also worked as an enforcer of the [[Golem (comics)|Golem]] and in this capacity, fought the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] when he interfered in Golem's machinations.

Jack O'Lantern later fought [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] alongside [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]] and [[Jackhammer (comics)|Jackhammer]] to attack the Thames Tunnel.<ref>''Union Jack'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following his defeat, Levins was recruited to serve as part of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] hero-hunting squad during the "Civil War" storyline. While pursuing Spider-Man through the Manhattan sewers alongside the [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]], Levins was killed when the [[Punisher]] shot Levins in the head, killing him instantly.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Penciller =  [[Steve McNiven]] | Inker = [[Dexter Vines]] | Story = War | Title = Civil War | Issue = #5 | Date = November 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, death would not be the end of Levins's story. His headless corpse was reanimated and possessed by a fragment of Lucifer's soul. He now exhibits the ability to detach, levitate and explode his head (now replaced with a real life pumpkin) among other powers. However, the Ghost Rider was able to exorcise him by ripping his heart from his chest, setting it aflame and putting it back in his chest, causing it to explode inside.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 5 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Levins was among the dead characters seen in Erebus by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. He was later seen on [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]'s jury (alongside [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Armless Tiger Man]], Artume, [[Heinrich Zemo]], [[Commander Kraken]], [[Iron Monger]], Kyknos, Nessus, [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Scourge of the Underworld]], and [[Veranke]]) for [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' trial.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, Levins's Jack O'Lantern form was among the characters that were cloned by the [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]]. He got involved in a fight with the other cloned villains, causing the [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]]'s clone to break it up.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jack O'Lantern later battled [[Deadpool]] after stealing 20 million dollars from the ''Queen Kathleen'' gambling ship owned by [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]].<ref>''Despicable Deadpool'' #297. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jack O'Lantern later led a similar gang called the Jack O'Lanterns.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #32">''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> When four of the Jack O'Lanterns turned out to be sleeper agents working for Finisher and [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]], Levins helped to contain the rampage by fighting the Jack O'Lanterns.<ref name="Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: The Chameleon Conspiracy #1">''Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: The Chameleon Conspiracy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Sinister War]]" storyline, Jack O'Lantern was with Foreigner, [[Taskmaster (character)|Taskmaster]], [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]], [[Chance (comics)|Chance]], and [[Slyde]] when they are sent by [[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|Kindred]] to attack Spider-Man after Kindred had disrupted their armored car robbery.<ref>''Sinister War'' #2.

There were two people who assumed the Mad Jack alias while wearing the Jack O'Lantern costume:

* Former Mysterio '''Daniel Berkhart''' was approached by [[Norman Osborn]] providing a version of the Jack O'Lantern costume, under the "Mad Jack" alias. Under Osborn's orders, Berkhart kidnapped [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] and exposed to mind-altering chemicals to be turned into a mind controlled pawn: the super-powered wolf alter-ego persona Man-Wolf. Jameson was then sent to attack [[J. Jonah Jameson]], to terrorize and cow into being subservient towards Osborn's scheme to buy the [[Daily Bugle]]. During this time, he also stalked Jameson's wife, Marla, implying that the two had a past relationship that Berkhart sought to rekindle.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #241-248. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* After Berkhart's working relationship with Osborn ended when the Green Goblin participated in a magical ritual that rendered him completely insane, Berkhart was then approached by '''Maguire Beck''', the female cousin of Quentin Beck (the original Mysterio). Maguire convinced Berkhart to re-assume the Mysterio identity following her cousin's suicide and the "Mad Jack" costumed identity was retired. But when the two sought to eliminate Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], J. Jonah Jameson and several other mutual enemies, the two revived the "Mad Jack" persona, with Maguire using holograms and lifelike robotic versions of Mad Jack and Berkhart himself to serve as proxies for herself while she laid in secret. In the end, Maguire was caught and exposed though due to her usage of Berkhart androids but Daredevil and Spider-Man were left unsure as to whether or not Berkhart was truly involved. However Berkhart did ultimately escape with a Mysterio costume, in the confusion at the end.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

In the miniseries ''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'', Francis Klum purchased Mysterio's weapons and gimmick in order to be yet another new [[Mysterio]]. The seller, [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], said he had acquired the arsenal "from Jack-O-Lantern".<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A fourth version of Jack O'Lantern is introduced during the "Dark Reign" storyline, is an unnamed man who claimed to be Steve Levins' brother. He has since been caught by the police after killing the 15 year old daughter of his neighbor and drinking his victim's blood as part of his plot to avenge Steve. This man was shown to be able to transform into a Jack O'Lantern-headed villain using the powers of a mystical demon. Detective Tom and Detective Steve interrogated the man. When asked about the pact with the demon, the man transformed into his Jack O'Lantern form where he is now surrounded by bats. When Detective Tom states that he is getting the [[electric chair]], Jack O'Lantern states that he's just biding his time until his "dark lord" arrives to set him free. He was later released by a lawyer sent by Norman Osborn who claimed that Jack O'Lantern is a material witness to a national security case. The lawyer drives away with Jack O'Lantern as Norman plans to gain his services.<ref>''Dark Reign: Made Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]", Steve Rogers knew about Jack O'Lantern, noting that Osborn didn't use Jack O'Lantern and suspects that Jack O'Lantern will continue his crusade to avenge his brother.<ref>''Heroic Age: Villains'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A new version of Jack O'Lantern appears working for the third [[Crime Master]].<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> As a child, the kid that would become Jack O'Lantern had disobeyed his parents and mistreated animals. While going as Jack O'Lantern for Halloween, he came across a house that Crime Master was in. The boy was taken under Crime Master's wing and trained him to be an assassin. It was with this training that the boy had killed his parents.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

One of his jobs brings him into conflict with the government operative [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. During this conflict, Venom threw a live grenade into his mouthpiece and it dislocated his jaw. Even after the explosion, he was still able to run and retreat.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Crime Master is able to use contacts to discover Venom's true identity [[Flash Thompson]], and has Jack O'Lantern kidnap [[Betty Brant]] (Flash's girlfriend) in exchange for Venom letting Crime Master get a shipment of Antarctic Vibranium. When Venom leaves to rescue Betty, he is distracted by Spider-Man's appearance, which drives the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote into an uncontrollable rage. Eventually Betty is rescued at the last second by Spider-Man, with Venom then trying to recapture Crime Master. However, Venom is attacked by Jack O'Lantern who proclaims Flash as his first real nemesis, and desiring revenge for the disfiguring grenade explosion, also mockingly calling out Venom's first name.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #3-4.

Jack O'Lantern later goes on a killing spree which escalated on Father's Day. Venom tracked him to a sewer thanks to the hidden trail Jack O'Lantern had left behind for him. There, he discovered that Jack had dug up the corpse of Flash's father and blew up the room. In the fight that ensued, it looked like Jack O'Lantern was going to win until Venom took his father's gun from the holster and shot him. Venom chose not to kill Jack O'Lantern.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Jack O'Lanterns===
The Jack O'Lanterns are a group of mercenaries led by Levins who wear the same costumes and wield the same equipment of Jack O'Lantern. They fought Spider-Man and Teresa Parker when they tried to capture Chameleon at the time when he was going to sell the Infinity Formula to Foreigner.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #32"/>

Foreigner later deployed the Jack O'Lanterns when he persuaded Chance into partaking in a bet to obtain Spider-Man's web-shooters. They were successful in their mission.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #40. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When four of the Jack O'Lanterns turned out to be sleeper agents working for Finisher and Chameleon after the Catalyst was obtained from Empire State University, they tried to steal the Catalyst and the Clairvoyant for Finisher.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #69.

==Powers and abilities==
Jason Macendale originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the Hobgoblin and the Green Goblin; both his Jack O'Lantern and Hobgoblin personas used a rocket-powered glider, pumpkin bombs, and gauntlet blasters. During the time in which a demon was grafted to him, he had superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as hellfire powers enabling him to create weapons and gliders at will. It is implied that his demonic abilities allowed him to create organic fibers strong enough to bind a normal person.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> After acquiring Kraven the Hunter's formula, Macendale had enhanced his strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, and agility to superhuman levels, thanks to anomalies in his blood left over when he and Demogoblin were one, but this formula's effects seemed to have later wore off. His later cybernetically enhanced body thanks to [[Mendel Stromm]] further increased his strength, speed, reflexes, durability, and stamina. Macendale had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry. He often used conventional military weapons. When he adopted the Hobgoblin persona, he was able to make improvements to the Goblin glider's maneuverability by utilizing skills he gained from his master's degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics. Macendale was also a [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] and a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]], which led to his dishonorable discharge from the military.

Steven Levins modeled his Jack O'Lantern costume and equipment after those created by his predecessor. Levins wore a complete body armor made of metal-mesh covered in multi-segmented Kevlar panels, incorporating a rigid, articulated shell which can resist a 7-pound bazooka anti-tank warhead. He wore a bulletproof helmet with an internal three hour, compressed air supply. The helmet is equipped with a telescopic infrared image-intensifier for seeing in the dark and 360 degree scanning device for seeing all around himself. The base of the helmet is equipped with a fine network of pinholes which maintain a low temperature, low density flame ("stage-fire") that rings the helmet at all times. The air supply cools the helmet's interior. The helmet is padded to protect his head from injury. Levins is armed with wrist-blasters which can deliver an electrical shock within a range of {{convert|35|ft|m}}. He also used various types of grenades, including anesthetic, lachrymatory (tear gas), hallucinogenic, and regurgitant gas grenades, smoke grenades, and concussion grenades. The grenades are shaped like spheres or pumpkins. He can fire small grenades from wrist devices. He can also release "ghost-grabbers" which are thick, semi-transparent films which adhere to a victim. Levins rides atop a one-man hovercraft with an electric motor powered by a high density lithium rechargeable battery.

Daniel Berkhart used the same weapons as the previous incarnations of Jack O'Lantern, along with chemical weapons that cause psychedelic and mind-bending hallucinations. His accomplice Maguire Beck was an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master hypnotist, and skilled in chemistry and robotics, including a lifelike robotic black cat. Beck has used her advanced knowledge of computer imaging and virtual reality to improve upon Mysterio's techniques, allowing for Beck to pretend to be Mad Jack via proxies while safely hidden in her secret lair.

The brother of Levins can transform into a demon with the head of a jack-o'-lantern using the powers of an unknown mystical demon.

The fifth incarnation, along with the same general weapons the previous ones used, has a fleet of tiny flying cartoon-styled devil robots. Instead of a hovercraft, he rides a jet-powered "broomstick".

On the day before Halloween 13 years after the Chaos! event, Jack O'Lantern launched a scheme to bring about a hell on Earth and take over the world with the proper alignment of cosmos. Raising dead persons and animating dinosaurs, he looked to gather the remaining heroes of the world for the purpose of eliminating them. However, Brother Voodoo (Jericho Drumm) and the Supernaturals were able to overcome his machinations, sending Jack into another dimension. With Jack gone, his minions disappeared and the world was saved. Jack O'Lantern may still be holding the heroes captured from the first Chaos! event in his wand and plotting another takeover of the Earth.{{issue|date=April 2014}}
