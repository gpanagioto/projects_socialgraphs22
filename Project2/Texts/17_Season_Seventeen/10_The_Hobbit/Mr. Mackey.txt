Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it. Uh no, Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit. Uh, but, but, Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay? Now, Wendy, Kim might be, uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, mkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel? Uh that may be true, but there is a very fine line, Wendy, between being a feminist and being a hater, mkay? And you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly! Now, Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER m'kay! No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school! That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?!  Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior! Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay? Okay, well Wendy, I'm just tryin' to uh- Oh, bye, jelly school.  Uh, Wendy, I'm just tryin' to make you understand how serious it is when you lash out at other girls. M-okay.  WENDY, IN MY OFFICE, RIGHT NOW! MKAY?!
