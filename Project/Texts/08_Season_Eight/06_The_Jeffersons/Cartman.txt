I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs.  No. Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels.  Oh my God, this is awesome!   Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world! Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!  They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train. Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come! Choo-choo train! Yay! ''Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.'' Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you. ''...Train together'' ''I've got time. Do youuu??'' ''Choo-choo train.'' Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight! You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want! Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?! You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away! He is ''my'' friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I- Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson! Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend! Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said ''we'' were best friends.  Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls!  Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember? Mr. Jefferson, hello?!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery! Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child?
