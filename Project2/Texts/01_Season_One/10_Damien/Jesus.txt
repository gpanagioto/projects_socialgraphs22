Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou.  Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show. Wow. That's pretty heavy. The ''Dark Prince?'' So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One. Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth. Damien! So it is thou, Son of ''Lucifer''! Let him come then. I shall stop him! Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - ''right here in South Park!'' This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history. Not yet. ... What the hell do you mean ''if'' I win the fight? Oh. Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation. Behold. The Evil One approaches. Oh - oh yeah?? Oh yeah?? Aw, come on! I weigh more than that. Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar- I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning. In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me! Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too! I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win. ''You're all a bunch of Judases!'' What are you doing out so late, kids? Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right? No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little? No way, dude! Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train. Give it your best sho-  Anybody get the number of that truck?  Oh! Oow!  Ooooooh! Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on ''Satan''. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook. It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up. ... Who said that? You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys! Okay, pal. ''You asked'' for it! Aw heck.  Do I have a choice?
