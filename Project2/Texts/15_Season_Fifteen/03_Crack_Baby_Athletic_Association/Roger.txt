Hullo? Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash. Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?  Er he's like love. People all over the world dress up like Slash and have different names for Slash. The Dutch call him Vunter Slash. Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?
