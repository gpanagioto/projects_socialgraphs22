==Powers and abilities==
During an experiment, Paul Duval spilled an unknown organic chemical compound on his right hand, causing a mutagenic reaction that permanently transformed the hand into living stone. As a result, Duval can turn any matter touched with his "stone" hand to a similar substance, with the effect lasting for approximately one hour.

Duval can also use the effect to transform himself into a being of living stone - with no loss of mobility - possessing superhuman strength and durability.

Duval also has a master's degree in chemistry.
