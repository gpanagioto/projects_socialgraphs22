Ron, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all.  Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground  When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused.  That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits!  Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe.  She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.
