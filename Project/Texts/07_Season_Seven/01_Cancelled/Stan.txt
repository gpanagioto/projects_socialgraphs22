Dude, sweet!  Dude! Visitors! That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors! Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before. No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that? I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream. What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef? Chef, we're in a repeat. It all started when Cartman got an anal probe. You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes. Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times. You all right? Where to now, Chef? Go on. Oh, nice going, Cartman! We wanted to see an alien planet or something. What do we do??? Let's go!  What is that? Chef! End of the road!  It's the police! Chef!!  Uh.  We're in the alien ship.  My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space. Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy. Dad? Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, ''Contact''. Okay okay, take the form of something else! Nno, that's stupid too.  No!  I like it. You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?  Our planet is just a reality-TV show? Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment! Oh shit, did we do that? Wait! Wait, they can't do this! Uh, let ''us'' talk to the network heads! Please, take us to them! Please! Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads? Uh, Earth? Look, we just want to talk to you about the show. But, sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get ''really'' pissed off at each other. Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us. Dude, we're trying to save our planet here! Sirs, uh, if you'll just let- Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong.   No, wait. We won't tell anybody if you don't cancel our show! I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent. Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders.
