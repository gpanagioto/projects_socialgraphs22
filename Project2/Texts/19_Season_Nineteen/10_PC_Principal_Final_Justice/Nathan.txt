Well? How do you like my new apartment? Huh. Everyone's gettin' one of these now, Jim. Nobody knows whom to trust. Don't you kinda wish you'd had one back when Leslie betrayed you and nearly beat you to death? You see, I've got expensive tastes, Jimmy. I like good food.  Have you been introduced to my current girlfriend? All I had to do was work for the ads and I got everything I wanted. My own loft, with all of ShiTpaTown right at my doorstep. All it took was some PC and the whole thing was set in motion. What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness in order to create a false sense of paradise. Only one thing can actually live in that world. Ads.  Oh, you're gonna sponsor my content some more, baby? I'm all ears. Here it is, Jimmy. Hot off the presses. The newest edition of Super School News, hitting the streets tomorrow. Not what happened, what's going to happen. The final sweeping underneath the rug. By this time tomorrow nobody will be asking questions ever again. The ads will have won. And I will be... The man.  Shut up Classiii! What? Hang on, Classi, I'm sorry.
