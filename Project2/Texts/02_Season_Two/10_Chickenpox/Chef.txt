Oh, ''damn it'', not now! Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery! What makes you think I would know anything about ''that?'' Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be ''very'' careful around someone who has herpes. Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a ''mouth''ful of herpes. You need to ''stay away'' from her. ''Oh'', then, Frida's the right person to go to. O-kay! Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
