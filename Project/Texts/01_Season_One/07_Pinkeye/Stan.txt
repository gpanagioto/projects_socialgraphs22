Oh my God! They killed Kenny! Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. Shut up Kyle! I'm Raggedy Andy. Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure. Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy. Where'd you get that? No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass! I'll kick your ass, Kyle! Hey look, Kenny's not dead. Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you? Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank. I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank." Whoa, dude! Wendy? You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember? We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair. You what?! He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything. Oh man, I feel like a total choad. Hey, where's Kyle? Whoa, dude! Yeah, me too. Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween! I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me. I bet I get more candy than you dude. No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference. Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine! Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight... Plastic pumpkin pails... Taser... For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.  How's your barrel full of candy Wendy? I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day. Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy! No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! Dude, Kenny! Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops. Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore! What are you talking about Chef? Oh my God, that means... Wait, where are we going? I don't know about this Chef. What are we doing here Chef? What? We told you dude. Hey Chef. Look Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? Let's get out of here! We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline. You call the number Kyle. We'll hold 'em off. Sweet! Wendy? I know, but uh-... but... Hey, yeah!  Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it. I, I can't. Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay. That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead. Oh man, I can't believe he's gone. Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw. You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving. Oh, then, what's Halloween about? Oh. Yeah. Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
