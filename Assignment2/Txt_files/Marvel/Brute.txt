==Fictional character biography==
Brute is a version of [[Reed Richards]] from a world created by the [[High Evolutionary]] called [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]].[[File:Warlock_06.jpg|thumb|right|Richards' first appearance as the Brute. He was colored green on the cover only.]] He was exposed to cosmic rays that initially did not affect him; [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and [[Ben Grimm]] were unaffected, and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] was left in a comatose state.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' Vol 1 #2 (May 1972)</ref> The cosmic rays eventually gave him the ability to transform into a savage purple-skinned behemoth called the Brute.<ref>''The Power of Warlock'' Vol 1 #6 (June 1973)</ref> The Brute became evil after being hit on the head with a metallic cylinder.<ref>''The Power of Warlock'' Vol 1 #7 (August 1973)</ref>

The Brute made his way to ''True Earth'', where he joined the [[Frightful Four]] to beat the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Thundra]] and [[Tigra]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #177. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, the [[Impossible Man]] inadvertently freed the Fantastic Four, who overcame the Frightful Four. During the ensuing fight, the Brute managed to trap the original Reed Richards in the [[Negative Zone]] and replace him.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #178. Marvel Comics.</ref> Once accepted as the leader of the Fantastic Four, he sent the Human Torch and the Thing into the Negative Zone and battled with Invisible Girl.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #182. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the remaining trio made it back from the Negative Zone with the help of [[Annihilus]] who lost his Cosmic Rod to [[Mad Thinker]]'s [[Awesome Android]]. After seeing Reed Richard's selfless dedication to his wife, the concussion that made the Brute evil wore off and he sacrificed himself to keep the original Reed Richards' promise to return the cosmic Rod to Annihilus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #183. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Brute was glimpsed when Abraxas scanned through the alternate Earths.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #47. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Abraxas assaulted Mister Fantastic, he told him "as you die on this Earth, so do your other selves across the realities". Brute was shown among the Reed Richards to be among the victims of Abraxas' attack.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #49. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Brute was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Richards can transform at will into the Brute, who possesses an 8–9 foot tall form with vast strength and durability. In addition, he retained his counterpart's brilliant scientific mind. Brute has the skill in [[Manipulation (psychology)|manipulating]] people, especially others into thinking he is the Reed Richards of their respective reality.<ref>''Marvel Legacy: The 1970s Handbook'' Vol 1 #1 (May 2006)</ref> At one point, he was able to absorb [[geothermal]] energy from the Earth's [[Planetary core|core]], increasing his own power. In this form, he could fire energy blasts.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Vol 1 #2 (May 2008)</ref>

==Other versions==
The Brute makes an appearance in the tie-in comic ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]''. In this continuum, a Counter-Earth version of Reed and his friends were exposed to cosmic rays like their Earth counterparts. Reed became a creature known as The Brute, Sue ended up in a coma, Johnny was dead, and only Ben was unaffected. Using his good standing with the High Evolutionary as Reed Richards (who tries to maintain his secret identity by putting up a snobby front), Brute secretly aids the Counter-Earth rebels against them. Ben Grimm helps out by gathering data held by The High Evolutionary.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>
