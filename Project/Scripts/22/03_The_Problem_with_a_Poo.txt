South Park, day. The scene starts with South Park Elementary being shot up again, then the Community Center appears as two police cars rush by, then City Hall appears. The city council is in session, Mayor McDaniels presiding

Mayor McDaniels

People, it's time we faced some hard truths. The town is looking to us for answers, and all we keep doing is burying our heads. We need to cut the budget for this year's Christmas pageant.

Randy

[after a dramatic pause] My God...

Mayor McDaniels

I've asked the director of the holiday show to stop by so we can all give him the news.

Ryan

He's not going to take this well.

Councilwoman

If he doesn't, we should just let him go. God knows it's about time.

Mayor's aide

Hey, a lot of people like him, all right?

Mrs. Testaburger

Yeah, and a lot of people think he stinks.

Mayor McDaniels

Let's just get this over with. [presses down on the intercom key] All right, send him in. [the door opens and Mr. Hankey hops in.]

Mr. Hankey

Hooooowwwdy ho! You wanted to see me? Better hurry. We only have two months before Christmas.

Mayor McDaniels

Mr. Hankey, we called you in to let you know that... your Christmas Pageant funding has been cut. By half.

Mr. Hankey

What? But I can barely make a good Christmas show with what I have!

Mayor McDaniels

We just don't have the support for the Christmas show that we used to. The truth is... some people find you offensive.

Mr. Hankey

Offensive? What about me is offensive?

Councilwoman

Some people think shit isn't the best representation of Christmas.

Mr. Hankey

Yuh... you people can't do this. Christmas is the most magical time of the year.

Mayor McDaniels

The decision has already been made. Thank you, Mr. Hankey, and good luck with the show.

+++++


South Park Elementary, day. Another school shooting has occurred and the police are back to investigate. In the music room, the kids practice "Deck The Halls". The conductor taps the dais with his baton - it's Mr. Hankey.

Mr. Hankey

Okay, stop. Kids, the song's called "Deck The Halls," not "Let's All Suck Balls." Mow, come on, kids.

Craig

Why do we have to do this now?

Cartman

Yeah, it's not even Halloween yet.

Mr. Hankey

Restoration Hardware put up their Christmas decorations two weeks ago, all right? Now listen: I didn't want this either. I wanted the Denver Symphony, but they cut my budget and I'm stuck with you. Now let's take it from the top! [taps his baton]

+++++


The hallways. PC Principal walks down the main hallway with purpose. He stops at the Vice Principal's office and turns left, steps forward, stops, sighs, then turns the doorknob and peeks in

PC Principal

Vice Principal Strong Woman?

Strong Woman

Yes, PC Principal?

PC Principal

I was seeing if there's anything you... might want to discuss with me?

Strong Woman

What would we need to discuss?!

PC Principal

I am- so sorry- that I took advantage of my position and- manipulated you into a physical encounter.

Strong Woman

Hey! I am a strong woman, all right?! I don't get manipulated! We both are guilty of an ill-advised relationship at the workplace, but that was long ago, and I have decided to move forward.

PC Principal

Are you sure we can move forward?

Strong Woman

Why not? We make a mistake, we move forward.

PC Principal

I was just thinking there might still possibly be some fallout from-

Strong Woman

Nope! We're just gonna forget about it and put it to rest.

PC Principal

You don't think there's anything else to dis- to discuss?

Strong Woman

No, I don't! Bye-bye. [PC Principal backs out and closes the door. Strong Woman lets out a sigh of relief, then stands and goes to a mirror, which reveals tears in her eyes and a big belly. She's pregnant.]

+++++


Kyle's house, day. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman are pounding on the front door. Kyle answers it but doesn't invite them in.

Stan

Dude, Kyle! Dude!

Cartman

Dude!

Kyle

What?

Stan

Did you read what Mr. Hankey tweeted last night?!

Kyle

What Mr. Hankey... tweeted?

Stan

Yeah. I guess after band rehearsals he went on Twitter to talk about us.

Cartman

Look! [Cartman takes out his phone and hands it to Kyle so Kyle can see for hiimself]

Kyle

Oh. Jesus Christ, dude.

+++++


Mr. Hankey's room. He's at a sewing machine making a Santa outfit.

Mr. Hankey


Santa Claus is on his way. He's loaded goodies on his sleigh.
He'll drop them off on Christmas Day



Kyle

Mr. Hankey.

Mr. Hankey

Oh, Kyle! Hoowwwwdy ho!

Kyle

Mr. Hankey, everyone's really mad at you. Were you on Twitter last night?

Mr. Hankey

[slowly] Yeah.

Kyle

Did you tweet "The kids of South Park are retarded homos who can't play music"?

Mr. Hankey

[more slowly] Yeah.

Kyle

Why would you tweet that?! All the kids are really pissed off!

Mr. Hankey

It was a bad attempt at a joke. I'm sorry. Will you tell the kids I didn't mean it?

Kyle

What do you want me to say?

Mr. Hankey

The fact is, I couldn't sleep last night so I took some Ambien. Do you take that stuff? It turns your brain into oatmeal. Please, Kyle, tell the kids I didn't mean any harm. We've gotta focus on Christmas! [Kyle just looks at him]

+++++


The school gymnasium, day. PC Principal and Strong Woman stand on the basketball court facing the student assembly.

PC Principal

All right, everyone, listen up. The vice principal has asked to speak with you today. She believes it is time that we all as a school finally discussed in-vitro fertilization.

Strong Woman

That's right, kids. Many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives. They can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown person's sperm in a lab.

PC Principal

That's right, Strong Woman. In today's society it is wrong to just assume that a pregnant woman had intercourse with a man.

Strong Woman

[doubles over in pain] Ooohhhhhhh!

PC Principal

St-students at this school need to be careful because it can be offensive to ask questions like "Who's the father?"

Strong Woman

[doubles over in pain] Oh! Ooohhhhhhh!

PC Principal

[looks at Strong Woman, then softly] You- you all right, Strong Woman?

Strong Woman

I'm fine!

PC Principal

So-so we'd like to have all our students talk to their parents tonight about in-vitro fertilization, and after that, let's just put the whole issue behind us. [Strong Woman stands up and fluid drops to the floor from her belly. Several seconds of stunned silence follows]

Strong Woman

That's my water breaking. Not a big deal. [more fluid gushes out]

+++++


The town square. Mr. Hankey gets the Christmas stage ready

Mr. Hankey


Christmas time. It's Christmas time. Christmas time. Yeah, it's Christmas time

.

Mayor McDaniels

[appears to his right with a crowd of citizens] Hankey! [he looks up and notices the crowd] We need to talk about what you tweeted!

Mr. Hankey

Oh, I'm sooo sorry. I took Ambien two nights ago and I called the schoolkids homos.

Mayor McDaniels

No, I'm talking about what you tweeted last night! [takes her phone out and reads] "The city council members are a bunch of pussy-licking Islamists."

Mr. Hankey

Oh-oh Jeez, did I say that? Listen, if you're tired and you can't sleep, DO NOT take Ambien. Okay? Whew!

Mayor McDaniels

I'm afraid we have no option but to fire you as executive planning manager of the city council.

Mr. Hankey

Fire me? Nonono, please. I-I'm really sorry. [the crowd turns and leaves] No, no wait! Wait, please give me another chance! Don't do this! What about Christmas? [croops in defeat]

+++++


South Park, day. A large sign announcing Mr. Hankey's Holiday Pageant greats the visitor upon arriving in town. A car speeds out of town

PC Principal

[in the passenger seat] It's okay. We'll be at the hospital soon. Just keep breathing.

Strong Woman

[driving, despite her condition] I didn't need your help!

PC Principal

I'm just a co-worker helping another co-worker in need.

Strong Woman

Yeah, well, people might get the wrong idea! I have worked my whole life to be the strongest woman possible, a person little girls could look up to. If those girls thought I was the type to get knocked up by my boss-

PC Principal

I certainly do not want to put an pressures on you as a female, but at times I wonder if there is more we should discuss.

Strong Woman

There's nothing to discuss! I made a mistake and I am MOVING FORWARD!

+++++


The law offices of Mayer, Schulz, and Tate, day.

Mr. Hankey

My civil rights are under attack. They can't just fire me from the Christmas show! The whole thing is my creation!

Male Lawyer

Uh, last night you tweeted "The city council can suck my Mexican dick."

Mr. Hankey

It was a joke. Look at me! I don't even have a dick! Get it? [no reaction from the lawyers] Okay, okay, look, I know: it wasn't a good joke. But it really wasn't my fault. The fact is, I went home last night and I was angry. I couldn't sleep, so I took some Ambien. And then I started tweeting. Ambien messes with my head. You ever take that crap?

Female lawyer

You want us to take this up against Ambien? They have the best lawyers in the world.

Mr. Hankey

Well, I thought maybe I could get them in a defecation lawsuit. [he is quickly kicked out] Rrrgh!

+++++


J. Prewitt law office, later. Mr. Hankey is seated at the lawyer's desk and speaks to him

Mr. Hankey

And I never ever would have said those things about the city council, but the Ambien makes me kind of blackout.

Mr. Prewitt

I'm sorry, sir, but we don't represent pieces of shit.

Mr. Hankey

Why not? [he is quickly kicked out] Rrrgh!

+++++


Gerald's law office, later. He's talking to Gerald about suing Ambien

Mr. Hankey

And I just thought maybe we could convince the city council to hire me back.

Gerald

Look, I'm sorry, but I learned a long time ago that if you defend poop, you get stained. [he is quickly kicked out. This time he just sits on the step and mopes]

Kyle

Mr. Hankey?

Mr. Hankey

Oh, Kyle. [sadly] Howwwdy ho.

Kyle

What are you doing here?

Mr. Hankey

Just tryin' to find some help. There isn't a lawyer in town who will take me. Wait a minute... You! You're the son of a lawyer. You have lawyer blood inside your veins! You can help me with my defecation lawsuit, Kyle!

Kyle

Me? What can I do?

Mr. Hankey

Please, Kyle. You're the only person left who can help me. You and me, pal, we are gonna fight the system!

+++++


Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Strong Woman and PC Principal have arrived at the hospital

Voice-over

Paging Dr. Bender.

Dr. Bender

Your vice principal gave birth to all five babies with no epidural. I must say, she's a very strong woman.

PC Principal

That she is.

Dr. Bender

The quintuplets are all healthy and resting away. [they stop by the maternity ward and look in] There are her babies, right there.

PC Principal

Oh, dude. Bro.

Dr. Bender

Yes, cute little buggers, aren't they? Three boys and two girls.

PC Principal

I think it's wrong to force gender specification upon them at this young age.

Dr. Bender

Funny. That's exactly what their mother said. [turns to face him] The quints are all Caucasian, blue-eyed, and something kind of weird.

PC Principal

What's that?

Dr. Bender

Well, the babies are all extremely PC, the likes of which I have never seen. Watch this. [walks to the intercom and presses the mic] Three black guys walk into a bar. [the newborns immediately start crying.] It's okay! It's okay! They left! They left! [the babies stop crying]

PC Principal

Doctor, would it be possible for me to... hold the PC babies?

Dr. Bender

Oh I'm sorry. That's only for the mother and father. Though, according tot he vice principal, the father doesn't even exist. [PC Principal wilts]

+++++


The neighborhood playground, day. The boys are shooting hoops without Kyle. Cartman shoots, but it's an air ball

Kyle

[runs up] You guys! Hey guys! I think I figured it out.

Kenny

(What?)

Kyle

How to get Mr. Hankey another chance. [no reaction from the boys] There's by-laws in the city council that community service leaders can't be terminated without a hearing. I need you guys there as character witnesses.

Stan

Nnnope.

Cartman

Not getting that stink on me.

Kyle

He has a right to be heard. He's meant a lot to this town.

Stan

Dude, why do you keep defending him, Kyle?

Cartman

Yeah. You know everyone in town thinks he's a piece of shit.

Kyle

Come on, guys. We can't just turn our backs. How many times has Mr. Hankey been there for us?

Stan

Mmmm. Once, kind of?

Kyle

Look, he messed up, but I don't know if he deserves everything that's coming down on him. I wanna stand by my friend.

Cartman

Mm, let's see how that goes for you in 2018. [the boys turn away and resume playing]

+++++


Strong Woman's recovery room, later. PC Principal peeks inside, then goes in and closes the door and walks up to her bed

PC Principal

Vice Principal?

Strong Woman

My babies! Where are they?

PC Principal

Shh it's okay. The babies are fine, resting in the nursery. They're the most... [voice cracking] they're the most PC babies I've ever seen.

Strong Woman

You shouldn't be here! People will start getting suspicious!

PC Principal

Look I was the one who abused my position and took advantage of a subordinate-

Strong Woman

Nobody took advantage of me!

PC Principal

N-Not took advantage. You know what I'm saying.

Strong Woman

And I'm a strong woman!

PC Principal

All I want to do is help. We can say I'm the manny. And if anyone has a problem with that, then they have a problem with gender biases, and they can take it up with me! We can keep the truth about the babies totally hidden. [the door opens and three nurses walk in holding the babies. The parents notice this]

Strong Woman

Oh yes, that curriculum should be fine for the students. I'll start working on an all-school proposal.

PC Principal

Oh yes, very good, Vice Principal. See that it is done by back to school night.

Female Nurse

A-hall right, Mommy! Your little bundles of joy are here. Oh! And who's this?

PC Principal

I am the manny. Anyone have a problem with that?

Female Nurse

No, not at all.

Male Nurse

Everything good here? [the babies start crying. He looks around, then at his shirt, which has an image of Speedy Gonzales on it.] Aw! Are these PC babies? [PC Principal and Strong Woman are stunned]

+++++


Park County Courthouse, day. The Mr. Hankey Hearing is being televised.

Voice-over

And now, live from the town courthouse, it's the Hankey Hearing on South Park 13. [inside, Kyle gets his papers ready as the courtroom audience takes its seats]

Mr. Waithouse

Mr. Hankey- [Mr. Hankey sniffles] Fourteen hours ago did you or did you not say "everyone in South Park is a God-damned douchebag"?

Mr. Hankey

Y-es. That was a bad attempt at a Christmas joke.

Mr. Waithouse

But there's nothing in that statement about Christmas.

Mr. Hankey

That's what I said: it was a bad attempt.

Mr. Waithouse

What part of the statement was actually-

Mr. Hankey

You wanna hear a good Christmas joke?

Mr. Waithouse

In 2005 you said- [Mr. Hankey sniffles] You said that you had no recollection of a- [Mr. Hankey sniffles]

Mr. Hankey

Sorry, I got the sniffles.

Mr. Waithouse

Mr Hankey, do you understand how important these statements are to the citizens of this town?

Mr. Hankey

All I understand is it's only eight weeks until Christmas! If we don't stop wasting our time, we're all gonna miss out on the most magical part of the whole year!

Mr. Waithouse

What did you mean last night when you tweeted, "The Mayor of South Park is a titless whore"? [Kyle's jaw drops and his head falls forward on the table]

Mr. Hankey

Oh, come on! It was a joke! That's it! That's it, I've had enough of this whole fucking sham! Fuck all you and fuck this whole system! It's Christmastime!! [leaves his chair]

+++++


Food 4 Little, day. Strong Woman is out of the hospital and shopping with three of the quints

Strong Woman

It's okay. Shhh. We just need to get some diapers. Shhh.

Elderly Woman

[passing by] Ohhh, what adorable little babies.

Strong Woman

Thank you.

Elderly Woman

[getting a closer look] My, they look very PC.

Strong Woman

Oh no, no, they're not very PC at all.

Man with Orange Shirt

Awww, look at the PC babies!

Strong Woman

They actually aren't PC.

Man with Orange Shirt

No? [bends down and tells the babies] Did you hear Monica Lewinsky's becoming Republican? The Democrats left a bad taste in her mouth. [the babies cry, the adults laugh]

Strong Woman

Oh God, shhhh, nonononono. Sheee.

PC Principal

[arrives with the other two infants] Is everything all right?

Man with Orange Shirt

Oh Look! More PC babies!

Woman 1

They're everywhere!

Strong Woman

I told you we need to shop separately! Sh! Shhh!

Man 2

[stops by] Excuse me, where's the Oriental food aisle? [the babies cry harder]

Man with Orange Shirt

Shhh! Quiet! There's PC babies!

+++++


Denny's, day. Kyle is at a booth with Mr. Hankey.

Mr. Hankey

Gee whiz. Thanks for comin' out with me, Kyle. [a waiter walks by behind them and stares at Mr. Hankey] These days, it's like you're my only friend. [Kyle looks up and notices some boys looking at him. Next shot shows Clyde, Craig, Tweek, and Tolkien at a window booth looking back at Kyle and Mr. Hankey. Kyle looks dismayed] So what's the plan, huh? What you got figured out to get my job back?

Kyle

I had a plan. You decided to call the Mayor a titless whore!

Mr. Hankey

[laughs it off] Oh, it was a joke, Kyle. Sometimes, when I take Ambien, I'm really groggy and moody the next day. It's a real side effect. It's printed right on the bottle.

Kyle

[growls] I don't know how much longer I can defend you. People are starting to think I'm shitty.

Mr. Hankey

Kyle, don't you understand this whole thing is a smear campaign? Why are people focusing on a few stupid words I said when Christmas is just around the corner?! It's like everyone's forgot about what Christmas means! [brightens up and gasps] Oh my God! Kyle, that's it! The holiday spirit!

Kyle

It's October!

Mr. Hankey

And that's the point! Don't you see? What we need to do is get everyone in the Christmas mood! We can bring the whole spirit of the holidays early!

Kyle

[looks away] Okay, you do that.

Mr. Hankey

Nonono. Kyle, you gotta help me! I can't do this alone!

Kyle

I have homework and stuff!

Mr. Hankey

You're all I have! Even my wife left with the Nuggets 'cause of all the pressure! Please!

Kyle

Okay, fine! I'll help you. But listen to me: I don't care how restless you get tonight, NO AMBIEN!

Mr. Hankey

Well, maybe just a little if I really can't sleep.

Kyle

No! None! If you want my help this time, you aren't taking any Ambien tonight. That's the deal!

Mr. Hankey

Yay! It's a deal! Oh boy, Kyle, I'm so excited! We're gonna bring the spirit of Christmas to South Park!

+++++


The neighborhood park, day. PC Principal and Strong Woman take the quints out for a stroll

Jogger

Oho, look at the little PC babies!

PC Principal

Oh, no, we're from uh, Missouri.

Jogger

I know a PC baby when I see one! [to the babies, cooing] Who loves social justice? Who's the future? Who's the big bad future? Yes they are. [one of the quints giggles]

Woman 2

Ohh, PC babies!

PC Principal

All right, please move along, folks. We don't want the babies to get excited. [a synthesizer begins to play, and everyone within earshot of it stops to listen]

Mr. Hankey

Helloooo South Park! Come on, everybody! Get over here! [Craig, Clyde, Tweek, and Tolkien exit the Halloween Outlet store with their cosumes] Who wants to see a miracle?! Howwwdy ho, everyone! Guess what time it is? It's Christmastime! [fireworks go off as citizens gather at the town square]

All

Oohhhhh!

Mr. Hankey


Deck the halls and trim the trees, Christmas time is here.
Gonna sing and flush our worries away. It's the best time of the year


That's right, everybody! Who loves the holidays? [all cheer] Just like when Christ was born, let's all be with our mothers and fathers and- [the PC babies begin to cry] Let's not forget that, that boys and girls all over the world are


Man 3

Hey! Hey, careful! You're upsetting the PC babies!

Mr. Hankey

The PC what-Listen! Christmas season means peace on earth and good will towards men! [the crying continues] All right, all right look, what, what is the holiday season about? It's about loving each other, right? Loving and- [getting exasperated] What?! What are they crying about now?!

Man 4

Sometimes PC babies don't even know what they're crying about.

Mr. Hankey

Well, then tell the babies to shut the fuck up! [the crowd turns on him] Who the fuck brings a Goddamned baby to a Christmas show, anyway?!

Kyle

[leaps away from the keyboard and grabs Mr. Hankey] Mr. Hankey, stop!

Mr. Hankey

Lemme go, Kyle! These people are idiots! [proceeds to beat up Kyle and wreck the stage. The crowd disperses]

+++++


Downtown South Park. Kyle walks down the street battered from the beatdown Mr. Hankey gave him

Girl

Mommy, something stinks. [they stop to look at Kyle]

Mother

Yeah, like shit. [takes her daughter's hand and moves on. A shopkeeper shuts his door as Kyle walks by]

Man 5

[drives by and honks] You stand up for all pieces of crap?! Asshole!

+++++


The neighborhood park, moments later. Kyle walks by with his head down. His friends stop playing to look at him. He looks back

Cartman

Uh huh! 2018. [they turn and walk away as Kyle moves on. Further on, he sees Mr. Hankey and stops]

Mr. Hankey

Kyle, listen. It was 3 a.m. last night and I still hadn't slept, so I de- [Kyle ignores him and walks on] Kyle? Kyle, please! They're gonna run me out of town, Kyle! They're going to erase me and everything I ever did.

Kyle

[turns around] You want them to erase me, too?

Mr. Hankey

Kyle, we can all be shitty sometimes.

Kyle

Uh... [sighs a few times, then turns away with nothing to say and walks off]

+++++


Strong Woman's office, night. The babies are put to sleep

PC Principal

They're so strong, like their mother.

Strong Woman

They're so PC, like... whoever their father is. [PC looks at her] We'll never keep them quiet. Our only hope is to keep them hidden. [closes the office door]

PC Principal

Can they ever know that I'm their dad?

Strong Woman

We did the most un-PC thing imaginable. Think about what that would do to them. We can never let them know the debaucherous, sickening circumstances that brought them into this world.

PC Principal

Then I'll just try to be the best principal to them that I possibly can.

Strong Woman

And I'll be their strongest vice principal, and hopefully... the world will calm down and not do anything to upset them.

+++++


South Park news. 

Newscaster

Today... South Park says goodbye to Mr. Hankey. The longtime union of this town and the holiday figure... is over for good. We should all feel pretty great about ourselves, give ourselves a little, nice pat on the back, as we, as a society, continue to try and sweep away all the poop. [next scene is Mr. Hankey walking out of town as the residents look on]

Mr. Hankey

Well, everyone, I guess this is goodbye. It sure has been swell.

Mayor McDaniels

No goodbyes, Mr. Hankey. You just need to go. We already called you a Poober.

Mr. Hankey

A Poober? They have that? [A Lyft car honks and pulls up] Oh, you mean Lyft. Well, okay. Goodbye, everyone. I hope I brought a few smiles and a few laughs into your hearts.

Mayor McDaniels

[opens the back door for him, then firmly] Goodbye, Mr. Hankey. [he hops in and she closes the door. The car pulls away and Mr. Hankey looks out the window and sees the town for one last time with a sad look on his face]

Stan

Where will he go?

Randy

He'll have to find a place that accepts racist, awful beings like him. There are still places out there who don't care about bigotry and hate.

+++++


Springfield, day. Mr. Hankey hops into the town square, which is filled with Springfield residents, including the Simpsons

Mr. Hankey

Hoowwwwdy ho!

Bart

Cool man, talking crap.

Apu

Welcome, my friend. Please, rest your weary feet and make yourself at home here.

All

Hooray!
