'''Maxwell Lord IV''' is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Justice League]]'' #1 (May 1987) and was created by [[Keith Giffen]], [[J. M. DeMatteis]], and [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=184}}</ref> Depicted as a shrewd and powerful businessman, Maxwell Lord was influential in the formation of the [[Justice League International]] in the [[DC Universe]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=215–217}}</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
Maxwell Lord IV is the son of Maxwell Lord III, a successful businessman and head of the Chimtech Consortium. Maxwell III set out to be a good example for his son by striving to always do what was right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://comicvine.gamespot.com/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/|title=Maxwell Lord (Character) - Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> When Maxwell IV was 16, he came home to find his father dead in an apparent suicide. His father had discovered that his company had produced a highly [[carcinogen]]ic product, and could not bear the [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]].

Lord's mother was convinced by her husband to employ a similar practice, cajoling heroic [[metahumans]] to help Lord. Thus, he sparked the plans to bring the [[Justice League]], leaderless and broken after the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] event, under his exclusive control.<ref name="jlgl20">''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #20 (February 2011)</ref>

=== Giffen and DeMatteis years ===
Lord initially works behind the scenes to establish the Justice League, while under the control of a computer created by the villainous [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. The computer wanted Lord to set up a worldwide peacekeeping organization as part of its plan to [[Hegemony|dominate the world]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/13/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-one/|title=Who is Maxwell Lord?&nbsp;– Part I: Origin &#124; the Captain's JLA blog|last=Kirk|first=Jason|date=2010-06-13|publisher=League.jmkprime.org|access-date=2011-04-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126214504/http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/13/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-one/|archive-date=January 26, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Maxmartian.PNG|thumb|right|Lord talks with the [[Martian Manhunter]] on the need for a strong League.]]
A later [[retcon]] changed his controller to the villainous computer program [[Kilg%re]] (pronounced ''Kilgore''<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2 #51 (1991)</ref>), which had taken over Metron's machine. A much later retcon mitigated the Kilg%re's and Metron's influence, stating that Lord already had plans for taking over the League, and that he would have pursued them regardless.<ref name="jlgl20" />

Lord's ruthlessness at this time is illustrated when he sets up a disturbed would-be terrorist as a villain for the League to defeat, resulting in the man's death. Later, Lord rebels against the computer's influence and destroys it.

Once free of the computer's influence, Lord is portrayed as an [[amorality|amoral]] businessman, but not a real villain. During the time that Giffen and DeMatteis were writing the Justice League, Lord is shown struggling with his conscience and developing heroic qualities, though he would remain a con-artist.{{Clarify|reason="though he would remain a con-artist" - Was he ever a con-artist to begin with?|date=March 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== From ''Invasion!'' to ''Identity Crisis'' ===
Originally a normal human, Lord is one of many people on Earth gifted with superpowers during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' crossover, when a Gene Bomb is exploded by alien invaders. This bomb activates Lord's latent metagene, granting him the ability to control the minds of others, albeit at great difficulty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk |first=Jason |url=http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/15/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-two/ |title=Who is Maxwell Lord?&nbsp;– Part II: The JLI &#124; the Captain's JLA blog |publisher=League.jmkprime.org |date=2010-06-15 |access-date=2011-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713024023/http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/15/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-two/ |archive-date=July 13, 2010 }}</ref> Despite being a metahuman, Lord never identifies as one. Instead, at the urging of his mother to act for the benefit of non-metahumans, he shifts his hatred for the generic "authority figures" who caused his father's death to the metahuman community.<ref name="jlgl20" />

After he is shot and placed in a coma at the beginning of ''JLAmerica/JLEurope'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] ''Breakdowns'', Supervillain [[Dreamslayer]] takes over Lord's body and supercharges Lord's power, allowing him to control thousands of minds at once. Using Lord's body and power, Dreamslayer almost forces the Justice League International (JLI) to disband. While possessed Lord forces the JLI to battle itself, the mortally wounded [[Silver Sorceress]] manages to contain Dreamslayer, and holds him within her mind as she dies, taking him with her. When Lord is freed, his power is burnt out.
[[File:Maxjl.PNG|thumb|right|Lord reflects on his time with the League.]]

Later, Lord is diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and dies. [[Kilg%re]] however, had been waiting for the right moment to reactivate its control of Lord. Kilg%re downloads Lord's consciousness into a duplicate of one of Dreamslayer's allies, [[Extremists (comics)|Extremist]] cyborg [[Lord Havok]] (in a further [[retcon]] the body is said to be a [[New Genesis]]-built automaton). In this form, he spends some time testing the League's capabilities and takes control of the secret organization the Arcana.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk |first=Jason |url=http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/19/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-three/ |title=Who is Maxwell Lord?&nbsp;– Part III: The Fall &#124; the Captain's JLA blog |publisher=League.jmkprime.org |date=2010-06-19 |access-date=2011-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126180015/http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/19/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-three/ |archive-date=January 26, 2012 }}</ref> The cyborg body later shifts to resemble his original human form.

[[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] later crash lands on Earth, easily trounces the League and kills [[Superman]]. With Earth undefended, world-conqueror [[Mongul]] invades and destroys Coast City killing Lord's mother. This event further fuels his hatred and paranoia against the metahumans, as well as leading him to believe that not only can metahumans not be trusted, but that their personal battles and scuffles are enough to shatter world safety.<ref name="jlgl20" />

Lord puts together several former JLI members, including [[L-Ron]], [[Captain Atom]], [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]], [[Booster Gold]], and [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] as the "[[Super Buddies]]", advertised as "Heroes the common man could call." These stories are told in the six-issue miniseries ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' in 2003, and its 2005 sequel, ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League.''<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk |first=Jason |url=http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/27/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-four-the-super-buddies/ |title=Who is Maxwell Lord?&nbsp;– Part IV: The Super Buddies &#124; the Captain's JLA blog |publisher=League.jmkprime.org |date=2010-06-27 |access-date=2011-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126142657/http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/27/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-four-the-super-buddies/ |archive-date=January 26, 2012 }}</ref>

In [[Brad Meltzer]]'s ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' (2004), Lord attends [[Sue Dibny]]'s funeral and speaks to [[Booster Gold]], further denting his already dwindling faith in superheroes.<ref>''Identity Crisis'' #1</ref>

=== ''Infinite Crisis'' ===
{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}
[[File:Beatlemax.png|right|thumb|Lord shoots Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].]]
The 2005 80-page one-shot ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' reveals that Lord is no longer a cyborg, and is apparently a criminal mastermind who spent years running the JLI while gathering sensitive information about the world's superheroes, whom he considered a threat to the planet. Simultaneously, he sabotaged JLI efforts in order to render the superhero team as ineffectual as possible. At the end of the prologue special issue, he shoots and kills one-time JLI member, [[Ted Kord]], the second [[Blue Beetle]], when the hero discovers Lord's secret and refuses to join Lord.

During this time, [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], the god-like son of [[Lex Luthor]] from an alternate Earth, gives Lord control over Batman's [[OMAC (comics)|Brother Eye]], a satellite system Batman created to monitor all superhuman contact. Lord uses Brother Eye to create an army of [[OMACs]] (humans infected with a nano-virus that transformed them into cyborgs), programmed to hunt down and kill all superhumans.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

[[File:WWMax.png|left|thumb|Lord is seemly killed in cold blood by [[Wonder Woman]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].]]
Lord also uses his powers to influence [[Superman]]'s mind, causing him to brutally beat [[Batman]] in the belief that he is [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. Lord subsequently sends Superman to attack [[Wonder Woman]] after making him believe that she is his old enemy [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] who has just killed his wife Lois Lane. Lord justifies the resulting destruction as proof of his argument about the dangers of superhumans, pointing out the devastation that Wonder Woman and Superman could cause if they fought in a crowded area, and arguing that the fact that Superman can be brought under another's control is evidence that superhumans cannot be relied upon. In the midst of her battle with Superman, Diana realizes that even if she defeats him, he would still remain under Lord's absolute mental control. She creates a diversion lasting long enough for her to race back to Lord's location and asks that he release Superman. Lord, bound by her lasso of truth, complies but states that he'll use Superman again to kill people. When she demands to know how to free Superman from Lord's control, Lord replies "Kill me." Wonder Woman then snaps his neck (''[[The OMAC Project]]'', 2005). In response, Brother Eye broadcasts the footage of Wonder Woman killing Lord all over the world, destroying her reputation and her friendship with Batman and Superman, who reject her despite the fact that she saved their lives.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk |first=Jason |url=http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/07/06/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-five-checkmate/ |title=Who is Maxwell Lord?&nbsp;– Part V: Checkmate &#124; the Captain's JLA blog |publisher=League.jmkprime.org |date=2010-07-06 |access-date=2011-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126224828/http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/07/06/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-five-checkmate/ |archive-date=January 26, 2012 }}</ref> As the crisis unfolds, the three eventually reconcile as Diana helps Superman talk down [[Superman (Earth-Two)|his other self]] and prevents Batman from shooting [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], accepting that Diana did what she had to do and acknowledging that, for all their differences, they all still want justice.

At the "Crisis Counseling" panel at Wizard World Chicago, [[Dan DiDio]] explained DC's reasoning in using Lord's character in ''Infinite Crisis''. After going through several possible characters who could be the "new leader for the offshoot of Checkmate", Maxwell Lord was suggested. Many of the editors thought that the idea made sense, as Lord had been shown to have a mean streak and to have killed previously. The idea was dropped due to the continuity errors, such as him being a cyborg, but they went back to it later after deciding none of the other possible characters were suitable. "We thought about that aspect of the story [where Maxwell was turned into a cyborg] some more," DiDio explained. "And then asked, 'Did anyone read it?' No. 'Did anyone like the idea?' No. So we moved ahead with Max as being a human, and having been a human, and not letting that small part of the past stand in the way of this story. We wanted what was best for ''Countdown'' [''to Infinite Crisis''], and for us, that meant that Max had to be a human."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?s=f7a18efa469e4edc763fec8bd47ffe94&threadid=40070|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206105645/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?s=f7a18efa469e4edc763fec8bd47ffe94&threadid=40070|title=WWC: DAY 2&nbsp;– DC CRISIS COUNSELING PANEL&nbsp;– NEWSARAMA|archive-date=6 February 2009|work=newsarama.com}}</ref>

=== ''One Year Later'' ===
{{Main|One Year Later}}
Lord reappeared in 2007 in the first two-story arcs of the new ''[[Booster Gold (2007-)|Booster Gold]]'' series by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dan Jurgens]]. At the end of the ''[[52 Pick-Up (Booster Gold)|52 Pick-Up]]'' story arc, Booster Gold and Blue Beetles from the past, present and future go back in time to ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' and prevent Lord from killing Ted Kord. In the subsequent ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|Blue and Gold]]'' story arc, Blue Beetle and Booster Gold discover that, in saving Ted Kord, they have created a new timeline where Lord was never killed by Wonder Woman and Lord's OMACs, and that a mind-controlled [[Superman]] has turned the entire planet into a police state. Lord reveals that he had been returned to human form after dozens of clandestine operations and that he learned the importance of control during that time. When Booster Gold and Blue Beetle, having assembled their old JLI teammates, storm Brother Eye, Lord is killed by [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Dr. Light]] when she blasts a hole through his chest. Ted Kord realizes that his death is the only way to fix the timestream and leaves the battle, seemingly to return to the past and accept his death.

Lord next makes an appearance in the [[Trinity (comic book)|''Trinity'' maxi-series]] (2008-9). Lord's skull is stolen by a group called the Dreambound and brought to [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine Le Fey]] for usage in a spell, which requires an item connected to Wonder Woman.<ref>''Trinity'' #14 (September 2008)</ref>

=== ''Blackest Night'' ===
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' (2009–10) storyline, Maxwell Lord is identified as one of the deceased people entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (September 2009)</ref> Lord's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (November 2009)</ref> Targeting Wonder Woman, he lures her to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] with a trail of slaughtered bodies. When Wonder Woman arrives, he springs a trap, using [[Power ring (weapon)|black rings]] to revive the bodies of fallen soldiers. Wonder Woman uses her lasso to reduce Lord and the soldiers to dust. However, as she leaves, the dust begins to regenerate.<ref>''Blackest Night: Wond''eventually ''e''elents, renouncing#1 (February 20uns

waya</ref> Some time later, Lord resumes his attack on Wonder Woman, who had recently been deputized as a [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]. Wonder Woman encases Lord's body in a violet crystal, then shatters it to pieces. However, Lord continues to taunt her, speaking out of a piece of crystal.<ref>''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman'' #3 (April 2010)</ref> He is later brought back to life by the power of the White Light. Though Guy Gardner attempts to restrain him, Lord uses his mind control abilities to make Guy let him leave.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (May 2010)</ref>{{Clarify|reason="to make Guy let him leave" - let him leave what?|date=March 2017}}

=== ''Brightest Day'' ===
Lord is among the other resurrected heroes/villains featured in the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' (2010) series. He is first seen attempting to push his mind control powers further than ever, but severely injures himself in the attempt, despite his meticulous preparations, which include a constant blood supply and an ice pool.<ref name=bb0>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref> Later, [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]]'s white power ring gives him a vision where Lord is shown shaking hands with [[Jaime Reyes]], the third Blue Beetle. However, in this vision, Lord is hiding a gun behind his back, implying that Lord is planning to kill Reyes, just as Lord killed Reyes' predecessor, Ted Kord.<ref name=bb0 />

In the first issue of ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', Lord is the subject of an unprecedented international manhunt. He is found hiding in the old Justice League International embassy by [[Booster Gold]], whom Lord is able to defeat. Lord then uses a device to amplify his mind control powers to unprecedented levels. With these, he erases the world's memory of his existence. Initially, it appears that only his former Justice League colleagues Booster Gold, Ice, Fire, and [[Captain Atom]] remember Max.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> It is later revealed in ''Brightest Day'' #8 that Deadman also remembers his existence. Lord uses his powers to disgrace the team, having Fire ousted from Checkmate, Captain Atom turned in as a fugitive for betraying the U.S. Army, and Ice isolated from Guy Gardner, who Lord causes to believe that she tried to kill him. He also influences the superhero community into believing Ted Kord committed suicide, which enrages Booster Gold. He then sends OMACs after the current Blue Beetle, [[Jaime Reyes]], who calls Booster Gold and the others for help.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (May 2010)</ref> Meanwhile, Lord discovers that his resurrection has come with a side effect: some of his efforts to control others' minds transform his targets into cadavers wearing Black Lantern uniforms.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #4 (June 2010)</ref> Contacting his former colleagues through a fallen [[Rocket Red]]'s armor, Lord reveals that he intentionally exempted them from the worldwide mindwipe, and that he wants them to protect the world as they did in the old days. He then warns the group not to come looking for him, unaware that Blue Beetle had located his transmission signal.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #5 (July 2010)</ref>

Captain Atom tells the others that an explosion, seen in ''Brightest Day'' #1, propelled him briefly into the 24th century, where he saw a world reduced to a pre-industrial state by a metahuman war instigated by Lord. The team resolves to try to prevent Lord from bringing about this dystopia.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #6 (July 2010)</ref> Maxwell Lord is at one point contacted by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]], who tells him to stop [[Magog (comics)|Magog]] from plunging the world into war.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> Lord then sees a vision of himself, with Magog's staff, killing a distraught Magog, who begs for mercy.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> The Entity gives Lord a vision of a possible future where Magog's team attacks [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]. In this vision, Parasite's absorption of Captain Atom causes an explosion that destroys everything within a large radius and annihilates over a million people (similar to the ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' future).<ref name="jlgl10">''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #10 (September 2010)</ref> Also, [[Power Girl]] witnesses her new enemy C.R.A.S.H. confronting Lord before heading towards the teleporter.<ref>''Power Girl'' (vol. 2) #15 (August 2010)</ref>

When the team next encounters Lord,<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #8 (August 2010)</ref> after mind-controlling first Fire and then Booster Gold to prevent them from stopping him, he teleports from the old JLI embassy back to Checkmate, where he attempts to enlist Magog to kill Captain Atom.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #9 (September 2010)</ref> Lord uses technology to upgrade Magog's staff into emitting energy blasts.<ref name="jlgl10" /> Meanwhile, Lord asks [[Professor Ivo]] to reprogram the [[Metal Men]].<ref name="jlgl10" /> He then asks [[Doctor Sivana]] to create a genetically engineered humanoid [[cloning|clone]] of Power Girl.<ref>''Power Girl'' #18 (November 2010)</ref>

When Captain Atom and Magog battle in the heart of Chicago, Captain Atom is able to convince Magog that he's being used,{{Clarify|reason=...manages to convince Magog that he's being used&nbsp;— by whom?|date=March 2017}} and Magog remembers Lord. Lord, watching,{{Clarify|reason=Watching who or what?|date=March 2017}} uses his powers to force Magog to kill himself. He then makes everyone believe that they watched Captain Atom murder Magog. The Entity proclaims that Lord has completed his task, and his life is restored to him.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #13 (November 2010)</ref>{{Clarify|reason="his life is restored to him" - Wasn't Lord alive already?|date=March 2017}} After briefly receiving a White Ring, the recently returned Bruce Wayne seems to be aware of Max Lord's resurrection.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #14 (November 2010)</ref> When Captain Atom absorbs the energy from Magog's spear, he is propelled forward through time to 112 years in the future, where Lord, while long dead, has plunged humanity into a massive metahuman war ruled by OMACs.

Also, Batman ([[Damian Wayne]]) tells him how to stop Lord's ultimate plans.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14 (November 2010)</ref> However, Lord is struck with the discovery that, with the exception of the original four ex-JLI members, no one in the world remembers Wonder Woman.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #15 (December 2010)</ref>

Later, when the [[Creature Commandos]] attack the JLI embassy, Lord poses as a member. He captures Jaime Reyes, and heads towards the teleporter{{Clarify|reason=What teleporter?|date=March 2017}} with him, while the others are unable to stop him.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #16 (December 2010)</ref> Lord regains his abilities to transform his targets into cadaver OMACs, and he tortures the captive Blue Beetle.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #17 (January 2011)</ref> Lord's mindwipes feed off psychic energy, so the more people who are around, the faster some of them will forget.{{Clarify|reason=The faster some of them will forget about what?|date=March 2017}}<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #18 (January 2011)</ref> In issue 19, the rest of the team locates Lord's secret facility in a submersible below the [[Sea of Japan]].

While the JLI learns Jaime is alive, the team also learns that Lord not only manipulated them, but also wanted the JLI to chase him to distract Checkmate. Later, Lord uses a device to enhance his mental powers, turning people around the world into OMACs to attack Wonder Woman and the JLI.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #22 (March 2011)</ref> Before the device activates, Lord sends the OMAC Prime that he controls to attack the heroes.

He also says that he only wants to protect the world from the metahuman threat, and he will continue to do so in secret.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>

=== ''The New 52'' ===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Max Lord still runs Checkmate as the Black King, but now has leadership seniority over [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] and its programs. He successfully captures Batman's superpower monitoring satellite, [[Brother Eye]], for his own purposes, but it ends up creating an agent with which it would act through seeking vengeance.{{Clarify|reason=This makes no sense at all.|date=March 2017}} Lord ends up getting into heated battle with an all new OMAC who was formerly one of the project's employees.<ref>''O.M.A.C. #1 - Office Management Amidst Chaos''</ref>

=== ''DC Rebirth'' ===
Still the running head of Checkmate, Lord assembles a team consisting of [[Doctor Polaris]], [[Emerald Empress]], [[Johnny Sorrow]], Rustam of Prime Earth, and [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] to assist him in his efforts to take down Amanda Waller.<ref>''Justice League VS Suicide Squad'' #1</ref> He chose these five as they were the 'original' incarnation of the [[Suicide Squad]], and hence have experience working as a team, prompting Waller to capture the Justice League to ask for their help against Lord.<ref>''Justice League VS Suicide Squad'' #3</ref> While most of the heroes and villains do not recognize Lord, the displaced pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman shows awareness of him, reflecting on his past contact with Lord before reality was reset.

Although the combined forces of the League and the Squad are able to defeat Lord's allies, they are unable to prevent Lord from achieving his goal; with the aid of a controlled Killer Frost, Lord acquires the Heart of Darkness from a vault, using it to enhance his powers to "infect" (take control of) the League.<ref>''Justice League VS Suicide Squad'' #4</ref> Lord uses the infected Justice League (apart from Batman, who Lord did not infect) to achieve "peace" across America, and has Waller kidnapped and taken before him. However, despite believing that he had taken precautions to control the Heart, Lord is forced by Waller to recognize that it is manipulating his perceptions, using Lord's powers to spread chaos and evil across the world, and twisting Lord's perception of what is transpiring. When Waller is able to bring him to his senses, Lord tries to remove the Heart of Darkness, but it consumes him and transforms him into [[Eclipso]].<ref>''Justice League VS Suicide Squad'' #5</ref> Eclipso is driven out of Lord when Killer Frost is able to use her powers to create a prism of ice, channeling Superman's heat vision at just the right frequency to disrupt Lord's hold on his slaves, with Lord subsequently being immobilized by Killer Frost. Lord awakens in a cell specially designed to hold him, with injectors pumping so much blood thinner into him that he would bleed to death if he attempted to access his powers. He mockingly asks Waller if she set this whole thing up just to 'justify' the Squad to the League, but Waller declines to reply, and simply informs him that he is to prepare himself for service on "Task Force XI".<ref>''Justice League VS Suicide Squad'' #6 (2017)</ref>

Lord later works under the supervision of Wonder Woman in order to stop his dangerous technology from threatening innocent people.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #764 (2020)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
In his original depictions, Maxwell Lord had no abilities, but later became a [[metahuman]] as a result of the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]]' [[Invasion! (comics)|invasion of Earth]]. Lord's powers allow him to [[telepathy|telepathically]] [[mind control|influence people's minds]], typically in the form of pushing a subconscious suggestion to others. Using his power causes Max's nose to bleed, and requires great mental strain. Over time, Lord's powers grew to the point where he could take full control of other beings, even [[Superman]], although it required a great deal of time and patience for him to establish the necessary level of control over the Man of Steel. His powers made him such a threat to global security that [[Wonder Woman]] was forced to kill him after questioning him under the [[Lasso of Truth]] confirmed that his death was the only way to free Superman.

When the character was resurrected, following ''[[Blackest Night]]'', in the story ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', he prepared to erase the world's memories of his past criminal actions; in order to survive the trauma to his brain, he placed his body in a large tub of ice and hooked himself up to a blood transfusion machine. The life entity somehow changed his abilities and would initially convert living people into the corpses of a Black Lantern.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' Vol 1 #4 (Aug, 2010)</ref> With his task completed, Lord was now fully restored, he then exhibited voluntary activation and control over every resting [[OMAC (comics)|O.M.A.C.]] infected within the global populace.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #17/23 (2010-2011)</ref>

Following a company-wide [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]], Lord was reintroduced as part of the [[DC Rebirth]] publishing event, now having been a metahuman since his youth. His primary power is tweaked to a form of powerful psychic persuasion which works best when paired with a vocal command. In this later depiction, his powers work by exploiting and promoting people's underlying desires and inhibitions to make them do his bidding. The only draw back being his power does not give him outright control over them, as he can only push them to act on their own subconscious wants;<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 3) #12 (March 2017)</ref> for example, he could draw out Deadshot's subconscious desire to kill his daughter so that he could be free to kill anyone, but when he used his power on Killer Frost, he only drew out her desire to make a difference.
