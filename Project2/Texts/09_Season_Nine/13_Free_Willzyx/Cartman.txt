I'm all wet! Sweet! Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!! Yes! Yeehehehes!  I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30. Why? Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares? Killer.  Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine.   Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go! Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man. Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale. You live on the moon? Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon? Yeah, we just have to keep him wet. He hasn't said a word since we brought him here. Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch. We have to hurry! Uh oh. Oh crap! There's more of them!  Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now.
