'''G'nort''' (pronunciation: "nort"<ref>''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'' (loose-leaf) #16 inside front cover equivalent.</ref>) '''Esplanade G'neesmacher''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. G'nort is a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]<ref name=jli10>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]] | Cowriters = [[J. M. DeMatteis]] | Penciller = [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Maguire, Kevin]] | Inker = [[Al Gordon (comics)|Gordon, Al]] | Story = Soul of the Machine | Title = Justice League International | Issue = #10 | Date = February 1988 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 6 | Panel = 6}}</ref> and later a [[Darkstars|Darkstar]] and a member of the Justice League Antarctica. He resembles an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[dog]] and is thoroughly incompetent and generally disparaged by other heroes; in fact, he is usually portrayed as being a loser and used as [[comic relief]].

==Publication history==
G'nort first appeared in ''[[Justice League International]]'' #10 and was created by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]. during their [[Justice League]] period.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=116}}</ref> His name was originally spelled Gnort; his semi-human face, manner of speech, and style of dress showed that the inspiration for the character was sewer worker [[Ed Norton (The Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]], played by [[Art Carney]] in the classic television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]''. However, in later appearances, his face became more canine and the spelling of his name was changed.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = G'nort | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 139 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
G'nort is from the planet G'newt. [[Hal Jordan]] explains that G'nort became a Green Lantern due to the influence of his uncle, who was a famous member of the Lantern Corps.<ref name=jli10/> Despite his obviously limited intelligence (not intelligent enough to read a map) and profoundly lacking tactical judgment, the character is consistently depicted as brave, loyal, and honorable. This fact is overlooked by most heroes, although [[Superman]] has pointed it out on occasion.

Early in his career, G'nort becomes inadvertently mixed up with the League's battle against the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]]. Recognizing G'Nort's general incompetence, the Corps had given him an uninhabited sector of space to patrol. The fact that the region was uninhabited also suited the needs of the Manhunters, who set up their home planet in G'Nort's sector. G'Nort joined Hal Jordan, Superman, and other Justice League members in an assault on the home world, although G'Nort's main contribution was getting stuck in the planet's ventilation system.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]] | Cowriters = [[J. M. DeMatteis]] | Penciller = [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Maguire, Kevin]] | Inker = [[Al Gordon (comics)|Gordon, Al]] | Story = Soul of the Machine | Title = Justice League International | Issue = #10 | Date = February 1988 | Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

===Working with the League===
G'nort's arch enemy, the Scarlet Skier (a take-off of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Silver Surfer]]), is described as being the only felon G'nort ever managed to apprehend in his entire career. Also an idiot, the Skier was mistaken for a pan-handling homeless person when traveling in the subway.

G'nort goes on a mission to rescue [[Mister Miracle]] from the interstellar trader [[Manga Khan]]. Traveling in a spaceship, G'nort works with [[Big Barda]], [[Martian Manhunter]], and Dmitri of the [[Rocket Reds]]. They chase down Khan and survive an assassination attempt by his hired killer [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].<ref>''Justice League International'' #14-16 (June–August 1988)</ref>

Both G'nort and the Skier were founding members of Justice League Antarctica, created by [[Maxwell Lord]] for the purpose of keeping both them and the reformed [[Injustice League]] out of his way.

The League, including G'nort, find their Antarctic headquarters overwhelmed by killer penguins. Their enemies are ultimately destroyed, but not before the facility itself gets demolished. G'Nort keeps himself and his new-found allies alive via his power-ring until help arrives.<ref>''Justice League America'' Annual #4 (1990)</ref>

G'nort assists the League, this time consisting of Manhunter, [[Crimson Fox]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], when Mr. Nebula, the Skier's old boss, turns his dangerous, cosmic-powered attention to [[Earth]]. Mr. Nebula saw the garishness of Las Vegas and thought Earth had the same taste as he and thus left.<ref>''Justice League Quarterly'' #2 (April 1991)</ref>

G'nort sees himself as a "Green-Lantern-at-large", not bound to a single space sector. His most successful mission (apart from capturing the Skier) has been when a gang of interstellar bank-robbing humanoid cats surrender as soon as he appears.

===Qward battle===
Eventually it is discovered that both G'nort and his uncle G'newman were actually given their rings by the Poglachians, who posed as the [[Guardians of the Universe]] while the real Guardians were with the [[Zamarons]]. A race of clowns, the Poglachians gave the rings to beings they thought would use them in amusing ways. They were actually pawns of the Weaponers of [[Qward]], who hoped to discredit the Green Lantern Corps by having the name associated with idiots. G'nort works with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], ending up in Qward itself,<ref>''[[Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 3) #12 (May 1991)</ref> though G'nort loses his Qwardian-powered ring. Their confrontations against a Qwardian [[Sinestro]] cult goes badly. Faced with the threat of his beloved uncle being killed, G'nort gives up the location of Hal Jordan.

Soon after, powerless but free from a Qwardian cell, G'nort smells the soldier who took his ring and tracks him down. The soldier swiftly overpowers G'nort and makes the mistake of bragging how he would torture and kill Guy. Enraged, G'nort defeats the soldier, gains his ring and saves Guy by destroying the source of his very own power. The two make it back to normal space as explosions devastate the local area. Afterwards, Guy Gardner reluctantly tells the real Guardians that G'nort was the true hero on Qward, which earned G'nort status as a genuine Green Lantern.<ref>''[[Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 3) #13 (June 1991)</ref> Around this time G'Nort is kicked out of the League and meets up with a struggling street musician whom he takes to calling 'Sax Girl'.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps Quarterly'' #1 (Summer 1992)</ref> He saves her from a life of homelessness and they have multiple adventures together. They part on friendly terms, with a kiss.<ref name=glcq5>''Green Lantern Corps Quarterly'' #5 (June 1993)</ref> He has other adventures on his own, such as battling several supervillains who pretend to terrorize a small town for a cut of tourism dollars.<ref name=glcq5/>

===Post-League===
G'nort presumably lost his ring during ''[[Emerald Twilight]]'' and subsequently (like many former Lanterns) joined the [[Darkstars]]. He still wears his Darkstar uniform long after the organization collapses, when he is captured by [[Manga Khan]], who attempts to trade him to Maxwell Lord in exchange for [[L-Ron]]. The entire situation goes badly, resulting in the near-destruction of Earth. G'Nort is set free after Maxwell Lord and Sue Dibny hold Khan for ransom. L-Ron returns with Khan. He is persuaded to form a 'Super Buddies Of Antarctica' branch and is seen trying to hitch a ride.<ref>''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' #1-6 (September 2003-February 2004)</ref>

G'nort was seen as the sole member of [[Super Buddies]] Antarctica, exactly where Maxwell Lord wants him. For a time, G'Nort lives behind Guy Gardner's New York 'Warriors' bar.<ref>''Green Lantern 80-Page Giant'' #1 (December 1998)</ref> He appeared later in the mini-series "Guy Gardner: Collateral Damage", where his homeworld had been destroyed by the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. The character was portrayed more serious in this story, suffering heavily from the loss of his family.<ref>''Guy Gardner: Collateral Damage'' #1-2 (June–July 2006)</ref>

As of ''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Secret Files & Origins'' #1, G'nort is listed as "Presumed Dead".<ref>''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Secret Files & Origins'' (February 2008)</ref> When asked whether G'nort would be making an appearance as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] during ''[[Blackest Night]]'' at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic Con]] 2009, Geoff Johns replied that the character was not dead and was still considered missing in action.<ref name="ccilive1">[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22236 CCI LIVE: Green Lantern Blackest Night Panel], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 25, 2009</ref>

In [[The New 52]], in the final events of the 2013 "Wrath of the First Lantern" storyline, G'nort appears and helps prevent the [[Red Lantern Corps|Red Lanterns]] from attacking the Green Lantern Corps during the battle against the villainous First Lantern.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 5) #20 (May 2013)</ref>

===Larfleeze===
G'nort reappears in response to a distress call made by the robot inhabitants of a planet seized by [[Larfleeze]]. Their rings mutually determine that Larfleeze and G'nort are cousins and G'nort becomes Larfleeze's sidekick.<ref>''Larfleeze'' #11-12 (May–June 2014)</ref>

G'Nort later becomes a central part of the Corps again. He is seen welcoming refugees to a Green Lantern stronghold.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 6) #5 (2021)</ref>

==Other versions==
===''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League''===
In the alternate dimension visited by the ''Super Buddies'' in ''[[Super Buddies#I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League|I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League]]'', the dimension is populated by twisted counterparts of the main universe characters.

===''Justice League Unlimited''===
In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' comic spin-off, G'nort starts his career as a regular Green Lantern Cadet, [[nephew]] of the famous G'Newt but lacking any skills and talents. He is brought to [[Qward]] by [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] along with other Lanterns to stop [[Sinestro]]'s last plan to destroy Oa by flaring over the planet with antimatter bursts.
Despite [[Boodikka]]'s prejudices against a rookie, G'nort is able to hold his own in combat, and uncover G'Newt himself as Sinestro's partner and accomplice. The Guardians, impressed by his courage, grant him the former sector of the deposed G'Newt to patrol.

===''Planetary''===
In an alternate universe ruled by evil versions of the ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' heroes, G'Nort is one of the many dead Green Lanterns on display in the Planetary headquarters.<ref>''Planetary JLA: Terra Occulta'' (November 2002)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* G'nort appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Eyes of Despero", voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]]. He, [[Sinestro]], and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] work with [[Batman]] to stop [[Despero]]. His backstory is the same as originally presented in the comics, as Sinestro mentions G'nort's uncle had "pushed" him through Lantern training. Though G'nort is initially presented as somewhat incompetent, he proves vital in helping Batman stop the brainwashed [[Mogo]] by draining Mogo's internal Lantern Battery. Despite forgetting the Green Lantern oath necessary to begin the process, he comes through upon consulting the "cheat sheet" written on his arm. After Batman compliments him twice and helps G'nort earn the respect of the Corps, he jumps into his arms to lick him, only to get a reprimand ("No licking"). G'Nort makes a non-speaking cameo in the episode "Revenge of The Reach", wherein he is blasted by the mind-controlled [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]].
* G'nort appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode "The Fatal Fare". He is seen during [[Roxy Rocket]]'s commercial for her transport service as one of her customers.
