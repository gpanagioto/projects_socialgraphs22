I'm scared. There's a ghost. But, Daddy, I saw the- AAAAAAAAA! Billy Mays, NO!   NOOOOO! Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away!  Make him stop, Kyle! No, it's... it's a secret.  I see dead... ce-le-bri-ties. I see them walking around. They talk to me. Just Ed McMahon.  All the time.  AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!!   Oh look everyone, I told you I was alive. Wee, I'm a child!  Come on, let's climb the tree! Hee hee! Noo, I'm a little white child. Let's play!  No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this?  ''[still dancing] Jou know! Jou know it! Hee hee!'' Oh lookie, it's a planet. Hee hee hee. Ignorant. Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me. ''I'm just a little girl. Hee hee. A dainty little thing.<br />And I know you all want to be a little white girl like me. Shamohn! Hee hee hee. [begins to moonwalk] Hohhh<br />[the male judges are masturbating furiously]'' Thank you so much for this award. Of all the awards I've ever won, this one means the most. I feel like... I'm finally at rest. I'm finally at rest! I'm free!  Holy shit! What the fuck am I wwwearing? Kyle, what the fuck is going on?
