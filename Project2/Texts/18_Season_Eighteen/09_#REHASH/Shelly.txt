Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the ''Women of Rock'' concert! Can I go with them?!  But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever!  She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself! That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything! So can I go or not?! Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys.
