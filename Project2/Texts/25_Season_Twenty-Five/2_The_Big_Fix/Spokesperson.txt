As farmers and cultivators of marijuana, we have a responsibility to society...  I know we all respect the crop here, and we seek each day to better understand the nuances and legitimacy of its uses. But we growers must face a harsh reality– Since the legalization of marijuana, communities of color, black and brown Coloradans, those most affected by the racist war on drugs, have now been locked out of the wealth creation of the industry.  Luckily, the public is starting to understand this unfairness– and many people are now talking of boycotting cannabis growers who are only white owned. We are seeing a healthy and dramatic spike in consumers who demand that their marijuana be grown by those who understand the fight for social equity. The bottom line is this– a completely white owned weed business these days... just isn't going to survive.
