Welcome to Burger King. Can I take your order? It's a plant-based burger, sir. No, sir. It's completely vegan, but it's engineered to replicate the taste and texture of beef. They're very popular, sir. A lot of people care about the environment and sustainability. So that's one Whopper, one order of chicken strings, and a medium beverage. Is there any-?  Uh okay, that'll be fift- Excuse me one moment.   Hey, what are you doing? You can't sell hamburgers here! This is a Burger King! Hey! Now look, buddy! I'm not gonna lose customers because of YOU!  We have plant-based burgers inside as well! Come try our Impossible Burger. STOP that! You gotta be kidding me! It's not the town's only plant-based burger joint!  It's Rick.
