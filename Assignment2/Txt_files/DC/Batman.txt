'''Batman'''{{efn|Originally stylized as '''The Bat-Man'''. Also referred to as '''The Batman'''.}} is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; superheroes (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by artist [[Bob Kane]] and writer [[Bill Finger]], and debuted in [[Detective Comics 27|the 27th issue]] of the comic book ''[[Detective Comics]]'' on March 30, 1939. In the [[DC Universe]] continuity, Batman is the alias of '''Bruce Wayne''', a wealthy American [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]], and industrialist who resides in [[Gotham City]]. [[Origin of Batman|Batman's origin story]] features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], who were robbed and shot to death infront of an eight-year-old Bruce, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of [[justice]]. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a [[Batsuit|bat-inspired]] persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with [[List of Batman supporting characters|supporting characters]], including his sidekicks [[Robin (character)|Robin]] and [[Batgirl]]; allies [[Alfred Pennyworth]], [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]], and [[Catwoman]]; and [[List of Batman family enemies|foes]] such as the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], the [[Riddler]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and his [[archenemy]] the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].

Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's [[Superman]]; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more [[bat]]-like. The character received his own [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] publication, ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'', in 1940. Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series used a [[Camp (style)|camp]] aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller]].

DC has featured Batman in [[List of Batman comics|many comic books]], including comics published under its [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s such as [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] and [[DC Black Label|Black Label]]. The longest-running Batman comic, ''Detective Comics'', is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and [[Wonder Woman]], as a member of organizations such as the [[Justice League]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such as [[Jean-Paul Valley]] / [[Azrael (DC Comics)|Azrael]] in the 1993–1994 "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]" story arc; [[Dick Grayson]], the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and Jace Fox, son of Wayne's ally [[Lucius Fox|Lucius]], as of 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/i-am-batman-0-comic-review/|title=''I Am Batman'' #0 Comic review|first=Sayantan|last=Gayen|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=19 August 2021|date=18 August 2021|archive-date=March 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220306043503/https://www.cbr.com/i-am-batman-0-comic-review/|url-status=live}}</ref> DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen in ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and its successors, [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|the incarnation]] from the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (2011) event, and numerous interpretations from ''[[Elseworlds]]'' stories.

One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic book superheroes and fictional characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and featured in [[Batman franchise media|various media]] and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as ''[[Lego Batman]]'' and video games like the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' series. Batman has been adapted in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s ''Batman'' television series played by [[Adam West]] and [[Batman in film|in film]] by [[Michael Keaton]] in ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Flash (film)|The Flash]]'' (2023), [[Val Kilmer]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), [[George Clooney]] in ''[[Batman and Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]'' (1997),  [[Christian Bale]] in [[The Dark Knight Trilogy|''The Dark Knight'' trilogy]] (2005–2012), [[Ben Affleck]] in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (2016–present), and [[Robert Pattinson]] in ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'' (2022). [[Kevin Conroy]] (also made live action debut in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on infinite earths)]], [[Diedrich Bader]], [[Jensen Ackles]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Jimmy Kimmel]], and [[Keanu Reeves]], among others, have provided the character's voice.

In early 1939, the success of [[Superman]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' prompted editors at [[National Comics Publications]] (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, [[Bob Kane]] created "the Bat-Man".<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=18}}</ref> Collaborator [[Bill Finger]] recalled that "Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of&nbsp;...reddish tights, I believe, with boots&nbsp;...no gloves, no gauntlets&nbsp;...with a small [[domino mask]], swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign&nbsp;...BATMAN".<ref>[[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]]. ''The Steranko History of Comics 1''. Reading, PA: Supergraphics, 1970. ({{ISBN|978-0-517-50188-7}})</ref> The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired as a child by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s sketch of an [[ornithopter]] flying device.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|2004|pp=18–20}}</ref>

Finger suggested giving the character a [[cowl]] instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|pp=21, 23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Havholm|first1=Peter|title=Corporate Authorship: A Response to Jerome Christensen|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=30|issue=#1|date=Autumn 2003|page=192|issn=0093-1896|doi=10.1086/380810|last2=Sandifer|first2=Philip|s2cid=162105264}}</ref><ref name="Archives 3">Biography by Joe Desris, in ''The Batman Archives Volume 3'' ([[DC Comics]], 1994), p. 223. {{ISBN|978-1-56389-099-4}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Daniels|2004|pp=21, 23}}</ref> Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: "Bruce Wayne's first name came from [[Robert the Bruce]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock&nbsp;...then I thought of [[Anthony Wayne|Mad Anthony Wayne]]."<ref name="creation">Kane, Andrae, p. 44.</ref> He later said his suggestions were influenced by [[Lee Falk]]'s popular ''[[The Phantom]]'', a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was also familiar.<ref name="autogenerated1">Kane, Andrae, p. 41.</ref>

Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods, and weaponry. Details find predecessors in [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], [[comic strip]]s, [[newspaper]] headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|2003|p=23}}</ref> As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had predecessors in [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] (created by [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]], 1903) and [[Zorro]] (created by [[Johnston McCulley]], 1919). Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane noted the influence of the films ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like [[Doc Savage]], [[The Shadow]], [[Dick Tracy]], and [[Sherlock Holmes]], made the character a master sleuth.{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|pp=6–7}}<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|2004|p=31}}</ref>

In his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:
{{blockquote|One day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man and I've made some crude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at.' He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it look more ominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.<ref name=autogenerated1 />}}

==== Subsequent creation credit ====
Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say "Batman created by Bob Kane"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] began receiving a "created by" credit on the Superman titles, along with [[William Moulton Marston]] being given the byline for creating [[Wonder Woman]], Batman stories began saying "Created by Bob Kane" in addition to the other credits.

Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of ''Batman'' #169 (February 1965) for example, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] names him as the creator of the [[Riddler]], one of Batman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, "Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by."<ref name="creation" /> At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.

[[Jerry Robinson]], who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Comics Journal]]'':
{{blockquote|Bob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn't sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why&nbsp;...[he was] going to leave [Kane's employ].&nbsp;...[Kane] should have credited Bill as co-creator, because I know; I was there.&nbsp;...That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for, was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman. As with Siegel and Shuster, it should have been the same, the same co-creator credit in the strip, writer, and artist.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Groth |first=Gary |author-link=Gary Groth |date=October 2005 |title=Jerry Robinson |journal=The Comics Journal |volume=1 |issue=#271 |pages=80–81 |issn=0194-7869 |url=http://www.tcj.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=350&Itemid=48 |access-date=November 18, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224083859/http://www.tcj.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=350&Itemid=48 |archive-date=December 24, 2013 }}</ref>}}

Although Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that "it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Batman, t' {{sic}} as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue." Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. "The trouble with being a 'ghost' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit', then one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator."<ref>''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #3. Winter 1999. [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]</ref>

In 1989, Kane revisited Finger's situation, recalling in an interview: {{blockquote|In those days it was like, one artist and he had his name over it [the comic strip] — the policy of DC in the comic books was, if you can't write it, obtain other writers, but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version. So Bill never asked me for it [the byline] and I never volunteered — I guess my ego at that time. And I felt badly, really, when he [Finger] died.<ref>"Comic Book Interview Super Special: Batman" Fictioneer Press, 1989</ref>}}

In September 2015, [[DC Entertainment]] revealed that Finger would be receiving credit for his role in Batman's creation on the 2016 superhero film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' and the second season of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' after a deal was worked out between the Finger family and DC.<ref name="FingerSep2015" /> Finger received credit as a creator of Batman for the first time in a comic in October 2015 with ''Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]] Eternal'' #3 and ''Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis'' #3. The updated acknowledgment for the character appeared as "Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger".<ref name="FingerOct2015" />

==== Early years ====
[[File:Detective Comics 27 (May 1939).png|thumb|Batman made his debut in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' [[Detective Comics 27|#27]] ([[cover date]]d May 1939), cover art by [[Bob Kane]]]]

The first Batman story, "The Case of the Chemical Syndicate", was published in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' [[Detective Comics 27|#27]] ([[cover date]]d May 1939). Finger said, "Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps",<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=25}}</ref> and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in ''Detective Comics''. By that time, Detective Comics was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.<ref>Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-7450-5}}, p. 19.</ref> The two characters were featured side by side as the stars of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', which was originally titled ''World's Best Comics'' when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including [[Jerry Robinson]] and [[Dick Sprang]] also worked on the strips during this period.

Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. "About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman", Kane said.<ref name="vapzdg">{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=29}}</ref> [[Batman's utility belt|Batman's characteristic utility belt]] was introduced in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939), followed by the [[boomerang]]-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the [[Batplane]], in #31 (September 1939). The character's origin was revealed in #33 (November 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that "by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals".<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|inker=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|issue=#33|title=Detective Comics|story=The Batman and How He Came to Be|publisher=DC Comics|date=November 1939|pages=1–2}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=560 ''Detective Comics'' #33] (November 1939), [[Grand Comics Database]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031025045854/http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=560 |date=October 25, 2003}}</ref><ref>John Jefferson Darowski, "[http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontentdm.lib.byu.edu%2FETD%2Fimage%2Fetd2158.pdf&images=yes The Mythic Symbols of Batman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421063924/http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontentdm.lib.byu.edu%2FETD%2Fimage%2Fetd2158.pdf&images=yes |date=April 21, 2008 }}" December 2007.

The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in ''Detective Comics'' #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of [[Robin (character)|Robin]], Batman's junior counterpart.<ref name="Wright_p17">Wright, p. 17.</ref> Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion, because Batman needed a "[[Dr. Watson|Watson]]" with whom Batman could talk.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=38}}</ref> Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of "kid sidekicks".<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|2003|p=36}}</ref> The first issue of the solo spin-off series ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and [[Catwoman]], but for a pre-Robin inventory story, originally meant for ''Detective Comics'' #38, in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Batcave Companion: An Examination of the "New Look" (1964–1969) and Bronze Age (1970–1979) Batman and Detective Comics|last=Eury|first=Michael|date=2009|publisher=TwoMorrows Pub|others=Kronenberg, Michael.|isbn=978-1-893905-78-8|location=Raleigh, NC|page=11|oclc=144224145}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/709/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Detective Comics #37|website=www.comics.org|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424190708/https://www.comics.org/issue/709/|url-status=live}}</ref> That story prompted editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]] to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun.<ref name="dan42">{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=42}}</ref>

By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos.{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|p=9}} In the years following World War II, DC Comics "adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy". The impact of this editorial approach was evident in ''Batman'' comics of the postwar period; removed from the "bleak and menacing world" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a "bright and colorful" environment.<ref>{{harvp|Wright|2001|p=59}}</ref>

=== Silver and Bronze Ages ===

==== 1950s and early 1960s ====
Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story "The Mightiest Team in the World" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discover each other's secret identity.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmund Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Curt Swan]]|story=The Mightiest Team In the World|title=Superman #76|date=June 1952|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Following the success of this story, ''World's Finest Comics'' was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=88}}</ref> The team-up of the characters was "a financial success in an era when those were few and far between";<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=91}}</ref> this series of stories ran until the book's cancellation in 1986.

Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954. Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed [[homosexual]] overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=84}}</ref> Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Comics Code Authority]], a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry. The tendency towards a "sunnier Batman" in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code.{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|p=13}} Scholars have suggested that the characters of [[Batwoman (Kathy Kane)|Batwoman]] (in 1956) and the pre-[[Barbara Gordon]] [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]] (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel.<ref>{{cite journal |last=York |first=Christopher |title=All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s |journal=The International Journal of Comic Art |year=2000 |volume=2 |issue=#2 |pages=100–110 }}</ref>

In the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science fiction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=94}}</ref> New characters such as Batwoman, the original Bat-Girl, [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the [[Justice League]] of America in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #28 (February 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic book series starting later that same year.

==== "New Look" Batman and camp ====
By 1964, sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was "planning to kill Batman off altogether".<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=95}}</ref> In response to this, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] was assigned to the Batman titles. He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the "New Look". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist [[Carmine Infantino]] to help overhaul the character. The [[Batmobile]] was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite were retired. Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed) while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet Cooper, came to live with Bruce Wayne and [[Dick Grayson]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=Gotham Gang Line-Up!|title=[[Detective Comics]]|issue=#328|date=June 1964|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

The debut of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character. The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and ''Batman'' reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies.<ref>Benton, Mike. ''The Comic Book in America: An Illustrated History''. Dallas: Taylor, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-87833-659-3}}, p. 69.</ref> Elements such as the character of [[Batgirl]] and the show's [[Camp (style)|campy]] nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, "When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books."<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=115}}</ref>

Starting in 1969, writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a "grim avenger of the night".<ref>Wright, p. 233.</ref> O'Neil said his idea was "simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after."<ref>{{harvp|Pearson|Uricchio|1991|p=18}} "Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil."</ref>

O'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story "[[The Secret of the Waiting Graves]]" in ''Detective Comics'' #395 (January 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker [[Dick Giordano]], and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was "tremendous".<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=140}}</ref> Giordano said: "We went back to a grimmer, darker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well&nbsp;..."<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=141}}</ref> While the work of O'Neil and Adams was popular with fans, the acclaim did little to improve declining sales; the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and penciler [[Marshall Rogers]] in ''Detective Comics'' #471–476 (August 1977&nbsp;– April 1978), which went on to influence the 1989 movie ''Batman'' and be adapted for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', which debuted in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&id=40748|work=SciFi Wire|date=March 28, 2007|title=Batman Artist Rogers is Dead|postscript=none|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201081512/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&id=40748 |archive-date=February 1, 2009}}: "Even though their Batman run was only six issues, the three laid the foundation for later Batman comics. Their stories include the classic 'Laughing Fish' (in which the Joker's face appeared on fish); they were adapted for ''Batman: The Animated Series'' in the 1990s. Earlier drafts of the 1989 Batman movie with Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight were based heavily on their work."</ref> Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985.{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|p=15}}

=== Modern Age ===

==== ''The Dark Knight Returns'' ====
[[Frank Miller]]'s limited series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (February – June 1986) returned the character to his darker roots, both in atmosphere and tone. The comic book, which tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated interest in the character. ''The Dark Knight Returns'' was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|pp=147, 149}}</ref> The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character's popularity.<ref>Wright, p. 267.</ref>

That year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC's status quo-altering 12-issue miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|pp=155, 157}}</ref> One outcome of this new approach was the "[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]" storyline in ''Batman'' #404–407 (February – May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] redefined the character's origins. Writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Brian Bolland]] continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot issue]] ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'', in which the Joker, attempting to drive [[Commissioner Gordon]] insane, cripples Gordon's daughter [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara]], and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically.

The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a [[Premium-rate telephone number|900 number]] for readers to call to vote on whether [[Jason Todd]], the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a narrow margin of 28 votes (see ''[[Batman: A Death in the Family]]'').<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=161}}</ref>

==== ''Knightfall'' ====
The 1993 "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]" story arc introduced a new villain, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who critically injures Batman after pushing him to the limits of his endurance. Jean-Paul Valley, known as [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]], is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Bruce Wayne's convalescence. Writers [[Doug Moench]], [[Chuck Dixon]], and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] worked on the Batman titles during "Knightfall", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's "[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]" storyline served as the precursor to 1999's "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]", a year-long storyline that ran through all the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion of "No Man's Land", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by [[Bob Schreck]].<ref name="nerd">{{cite book|last1=Weldon|first1=Glen|author-link1=Glen Weldon|title=The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture|date=2016|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-4767-5669-1}}</ref>

Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was [[Jeph Loeb]]. Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries (''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Victory|Dark Victory]]'') that pit an early-in-his-career version of Batman against his entire [[List of Batman family enemies#Classic rogues gallery|rogues gallery]] (including [[Two-Face]], whose origin was re-envisioned by Loeb) while dealing with various mysteries involving [[serial killer]]s [[Holiday killer|Holiday]] and the [[Hangman (DC Comics)|Hangman]]. In 2003, Loeb teamed with artist [[Jim Lee]] to work on another mystery arc: "[[Batman: Hush]]" for the main Batman book. The 12–issue story line has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire rogues gallery, including an apparently resurrected [[Jason Todd]], while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]].<ref name="visual">{{cite book|chapter= 2000s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9}}</ref> While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. The series became #1 on the [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] sales chart for the first time since ''Batman'' #500 (October 1993) and Todd's appearance laid the groundwork for writer [[Judd Winick]]'s subsequent run as writer on ''Batman'', with another multi-issue arc, "[[Batman: Under the Hood|Under the Hood]]", which ran from ''Batman'' #637–650 (April 2005 – April 2006).

In 2005, DC launched ''[[All Star Batman & Robin, the Boy Wonder|All Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder]]'', a stand-alone comic book miniseries set outside the main DC Universe continuity.

Starting in 2006, [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Paul Dini]] were the regular writers of ''Batman'' and ''Detective Comics'', with Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore. Most notably of these elements were the science fiction-themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman experienced under the influence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training. Morrison's run climaxed with "[[Batman R.I.P.]]", which brought Batman up against the villainous "Black Glove" organization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. "Batman R.I.P." segued into ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (also written by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of [[Darkseid]]. In the 2009 miniseries ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', Wayne's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman, and Wayne's son Damian becomes the new Robin.<ref name="comics.ign.com">{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Dan |title=Grant Morrison's New Batman and Robin |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p1.html |date=August 8, 2009 |website=IGN |access-date=August 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609172555/http://comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p1.html |archive-date=June 9, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Interview">{{cite web |last=George |first=Richard |title=Morrison discusses ''Batman and Robin'' |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/961/961488p1.html |date=March 11, 2009 |website=IGN |access-date=August 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305225820/http://comics.ign.com/articles/961/961488p1.html |archive-date=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing ''Batman'', while Grant Morrison was given their own series, titled ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]''.<ref name="io9">{{cite web |last=Wilkins |first=Alasdair |title=Batman Is Reborn&nbsp;...

In 2010, the storyline ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'' saw Bruce travel through history, eventually returning to the present day. Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman, he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well. Bruce decided to take his crime-fighting cause globally, which is the central focus of ''[[Batman Incorporated]]''. DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in ''Batman'', ''Detective Comics'', and ''Batman and Robin'', while Wayne would be the main character in ''Batman Incorporated''. Also, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]''.

==== ''The New 52'' ====

{{See also|The New 52}}
In September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero comic books, including its ''Batman'' franchise, were cancelled and relaunched with new #1 issues as part of ''[[The New 52]]'' [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and is featured in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'', ''[[Detective Comics]]'', ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'', and ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]''. Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract new readers, Batman's history remains mostly intact. ''Batman Incorporated'' was relaunched in 2012–2013 to complete the "Leviathan" storyline.

With the beginning of ''The New 52'', [[Scott Snyder]] was the writer of the ''Batman'' title. His first major story arc was "[[Night of the Owls]]", where Batman confronts the [[Court of Owls]], a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was "[[Death of the Family]]", where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was "[[Batman: Zero Year]]", which redefined Batman's origin in ''The New 52''. It followed ''Batman'' vol. 2 #0, published in June 2012, which explored the character's early years. The final storyline before the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' (2015) storyline was "[[Batman: Endgame|Endgame]]", depicting the supposed final battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus onto Gotham City. The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker's supposed deaths.

Starting with ''Batman'' vol. 2 #41, Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce's mantle as a new, state-sanctioned, robotic-Batman, debuting in the [[Free Comic Book Day]] special comic ''Divergence''. However, Bruce Wayne is soon revealed to be alive, albeit now with almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his life as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne finds happiness and proposes to his girlfriend, [[Julie Madison]], but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to destroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a "strange star" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne discovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot (it is heavily implied that this is the amnesic Joker) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories as the reborn Bruce Wayne. He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor. Gordon gets his job back as the commissioner, and the government Batman project is shut down.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/23/scott-snyder-and-greg-capullo-batman-50-interview |title=Batman's Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo on the New Batsuit and Bloom's Identity |author=Joshua Yehl |date=March 23, 2016 |work=IGN |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423225606/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/23/scott-snyder-and-greg-capullo-batman-50-interview |archive-date=April 23, 2016 }}</ref>

==== ''DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier'' ====

In June 2016, the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles. ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' was rebooted as starting with a one-shot issue entitled ''Batman: Rebirth'' #1 (August 2016). The series then began shipping twice-monthly as a third volume, starting with ''Batman'' vol. 3 #1 (August 2016). The third volume of ''Batman'' was written by [[Tom King (comic book writer)|Tom King]], and artwork was provided by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]] and Mikel Janín. The ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' series introduced two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl.

Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade.{{sfnp|Beatty|2005|p=51}} This is in contrast to the Post-''Crisis'' Superman, whose [[Clark Kent]] persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the facade.<ref>Aichele, G.

Bruce Wayne's principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill. Bruce Wayne believes that our actions define us, we fail for a reason and anything is possible.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holy Wisdom, Batman!: 24 Most Famous Batman Quotes |url=https://brightdrops.com/batman-quotes |website=brightdrops.com |date=August 25, 2017 |access-date=May 13, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-date=May 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513135913/https://brightdrops.com/batman-quotes}}</ref>

Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison<ref>{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title=Batman versus Superman as class warfare? Grant Morrison: 'Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss'|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/13/batman-versus-superman-as-class-warfare-bruce-has-a-butler-clark-has-a-boss/|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015182152/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/13/batman-versus-superman-as-class-warfare-bruce-has-a-butler-clark-has-a-boss/ |archive-date=October 15, 2012}}</ref> notes that both heroes "believe in the same kind of things" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. Morrison notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: "Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss." T. James Musler's book ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All'' explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman.<ref>T. James Musler. 2006. ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All''.</ref>

Will Brooker notes in his book ''Batman Unmasked'' that "the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the young audience&nbsp;...he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him&nbsp;...and they're never wrong."<ref>{{cite book |title=Batman Unmasked |last=Brooker |first=Will |year=2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=NY/London |isbn=978-0-8264-1343-7 |page=368 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNRreYO91ogC&q=Unmasking+Batman&pg=PA137 |access-date=November 8, 2020 |archive-date=July 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210730122644/https://books.google.com/books?id=GNRreYO91ogC&q=Unmasking+Batman&pg=PA137 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Personality ====
Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as ''"wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession"''.<ref name="pearson pg 186" /> The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years with different creative teams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: "[[Julius Schwartz|Julie Schwartz]] did a Batman in ''Batman'' and ''Detective'' and [[Murray Boltinoff]] did a Batman in the ''Brave and the Bold'' and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days."<ref>Pearson; Uricchio. "Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil" p. 23.</ref>

The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that "there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes".<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=31}}</ref> Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist<ref name="ReferenceA">''Detective Comics'' #33 (November 1939), Bill Finger, Bob Kane</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">''Batman'' #1 (spring 1940), Bill Finger, Bob Kane</ref> and to train his body into physical perfection<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref name="ReferenceB" /> to fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref name="ReferenceB" /> He also speaks over 40 different languages.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lewis |first1=Andrew |title=Batman: 15 Things You Didn't Know About Bruce Wayne |url=https://screenrant.com/bruce-wayne-batman-trivia-facts/ |website=ScreenRant |date=January 3, 2017 |access-date=May 13, 2019 |archive-date=May 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513132756/https://screenrant.com/bruce-wayne-batman-trivia-facts/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Another of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the "reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions".<ref>{{harvp|Pearson|Uricchio|1991|p=194}}</ref> The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures.<ref name="pearson pg 186" />

Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as "a [[Dionysus|dionysian]] figure, a force for [[anarchy]] that imposes an individual order".<ref>Sharrett, Christopher. "Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller". ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, p. 44.</ref> Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting,<ref>Pearson, p. 208.</ref> a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty [[conscience]].<ref>Dennis O'Neil, Wizard Batman Special 1998</ref> Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into Batman's characterization,<ref name="Terrence R. Wandtke 91">{{cite book|title=The Amazing Transforming Superhero!: Essays on the Revision of Characters on the Revision of Characters in Comic Books, Film and Television|author=Terrence R. Wandtke|page=91}}</ref> such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and increasingly alienated behavior. Batman, shortly a year after his debut and the introduction of Robin, was changed in 1940 after DC editor Whitney Ellsworth felt the character would be tainted by his lethal methods and DC established their own ethical code, subsequently he was retconned to have a stringent moral code,<ref name="dan42" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Batman & Me: An Autobiography|last=Kane|first=Bob|date=1989|publisher=Eclipse Books|others=Andrae, Tom.|isbn=1-56060-017-9|location=Forestville, CA|page=45|oclc=21114759}}</ref> which has stayed with the character of Batman ever since. Miller's Batman was closer to the original pre-Robin version, who was willing to kill criminals if necessary.<ref>{{cite book|title=Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature|author1=Alex S. Romagnoli |author2=Gian S. Pagnucci |page=27}}</ref>

=== Others ===
On several occasions former Robin [[Dick Grayson]] has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010.<ref name="visual" /> As part of DC's [[The New 52|2011 continuity relaunch]], Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the ''Flashpoint'' crossover event.

In an interview with [[IGN]], Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and [[Damian Wayne]] as Robin represented a "reverse" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, "a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin". Morrison explained their intentions for the new characterization of Batman: "Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the [[Teen Titans]], and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; {{sic|hide=y|He's}} a lot looser and more relaxed."<ref name="comics.ign.com" />

Over the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence. Jean-Paul Valley, also known as [[Azrael (DC Comics)|Azrael]], assumed the cowl after the events of the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' saga.<ref name="visual" /> [[James Gordon (character)|Jim Gordon]] donned a mecha-suit after the events of ''[[Batman: Endgame]]'', and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016. In 2021, as part of the ''[[Fear State]]'' crossover event, [[Lucius Fox]]'s son Jace Fox succeeds Bruce as Batman in a 2021 storyline, depicted in the series ''I Am Batman'', after Batman was declared dead.

Additionally, members of the group [[Batman Incorporated]], Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world.<ref name="visual" /> Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne.

== Supporting characters ==
{{Main|List of Batman supporting characters}}

Batman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.<ref name="pearson pg 186" />

=== Enemies ===
{{Main|List of Batman family enemies}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BatmanRoguesGallery.jpg|thumb|upright|Batman surrounded by his enemies, art by [[Alex Ross]]]] -->

Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime.{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|p=8}} These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's ''[[List of Batman family enemies#Classic rogues gallery|rogues gallery]]''. Batman's "most implacable foe" is the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker represents "everything Batman [opposes]".{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|p=9}} Other long-time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery include [[Catwoman]] (a [[Burglary|cat burglar]] anti-heroine who is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Riddler]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Clayface]], and [[Killer Croc]], among others. Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at [[Arkham Asylum]].

=== Allies ===

;Alfred
{{Main|Alfred Pennyworth}}
Batman's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], first appeared in ''Batman'' #16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. Alfred raised Bruce after his parents' death and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character "[lends] a homely touch to Batman's environs and [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand" to the hero and his sidekick.{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|p=8}}

;"Batman family"
The informal name "[[Batman family]]" is used for a group of characters closely allied with Batman, generally masked vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit approval. They include: [[Barbara Gordon]], Commissioner Gordon's daughter, who has fought crime under the vigilante identity of [[Batgirl]] and, during a period in which she was reliant on a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, the [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] the Oracle; [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], the sole surviving member of a mob family turned vigilante, who has worked with Batman on occasion, primarily as the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] and as Batgirl for a brief stint; [[Cassandra Cain]], the daughter of professional assassins [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], and [[Lady Shiva]], who succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl.

;Civilians
[[Lucius Fox]], a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne's business manager who is well aware of his employer's clandestine vigilante activities; [[Leslie Thompkins|Dr. Leslie Thompkins]], a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate parental figure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity; [[Vicki Vale]], an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman's activities for the ''Gotham Gazette''; [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], Batman's canine partner who was mainly active in the 1950s and 1960s;<ref name="138D">{{harvp|Daniels|1995|p=138}}</ref> and [[Bat-Mite]], an extra-dimensional imp mostly active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.<ref name="138D" />

;GCPD
{{Main|Gotham City Police Department}}

As Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, [[Chief of police|Commissioner]] [[James Gordon (character)|James "Jim" Gordon]] debuted along with Batman in ''Detective Comics'' #27 and has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-fighting [[everyman]], he shares Batman's goals while offering, much as the character of [[Dr. Watson]] does in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, a normal person's perspective on the work of Batman's extraordinary genius.

;Justice League
{{Main|Justice League}}

Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the [[Justice League of America]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of ''World's Finest Comics'' and ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series. In Pre-''Crisis'' continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they are still close friends but an uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 (December 2003), [[Superman]] observes, "Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him."<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | penciller = [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | inker = [[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]] | title = [[Superman/Batman]] | story = Running Wild | issue = #3 | date = December 2003 | publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

;Robin
{{anchor|Robin}}
{{Main|Robin (character)}}

[[File:Batman & Robin (Batman vol. 1 -9 Feb. 1942).jpg|thumb|Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]], art by [[Jack Burnley]]]]
Robin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years.{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|p=7}} Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because "Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking."<ref>{{cite book|last=Langley |first=Travis|title=Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=179}}</ref> The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero [[Nightwing]]. A second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the [[Red Hood]], and became an [[antihero]] vigilante with no qualms about using [[firearm]]s or [[deadly force]]. [[Carrie Kelley]], the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.

The third Robin in the mainstream comics is [[Tim Drake]], who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series, and currently goes by the [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]], a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the first decade of the new millennium, [[Stephanie Brown (character)|Stephanie Brown]] served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made vigilante identity the Spoiler, and later as [[Batgirl]].<ref>Langley, 180–210</ref> After Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to [[Damian Wayne]], the 10-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and [[Talia al Ghul]], in the late 2000s.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Esposito | first = Joey | title = Why Damian Wayne is the Best Robin  | website = IGN | date = March 5, 2013 | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/06/why-damian-wayne-is-the-best-robin/ | access-date = February 17, 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140301042547/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/06/why-damian-wayne-is-the-best-robin| archive-date = March 1, 2014}}</ref> Damian's tenure as ''du jour'' Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of ''[[Batman Incorporated]]'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Saul | first = Josh | title = DC killing off Batman's 'Boy Wonder' Damian Wayne in new comic book | newspaper = The New York Post| date = February 25, 2013 | url = https://nypost.com/2013/02/25/dc-killing-off-batmans-boy-wonder-damian-wayne-in-new-comic-book/ | access-date = February 17, 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140429184730/http://nypost.com/2013/02/25/dc-killing-off-batmans-boy-wonder-damian-wayne-in-new-comic-book/| archive-date = April 29, 2014}}</ref> Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the [[Ornithology|ornithological]] theme nonetheless; she debuted the codename and identity of the [[Bluebird (DC Comics)|Bluebird]] in 2014.

===Relationships===
====Family tree====
[[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]] is the biological daughter of [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Bruce Wayne]] and [[Catwoman#Golden and Silver Age versions|Selina Kyle]] of an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] established in the early 1960s ([[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]) where the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] stories took place. [[Damian Wayne]] is the biological son of Bruce Wayne and [[Talia al Ghul]],<ref name="comics.ign.com" /><ref>''Batman'' #666 (page 2)</ref><ref name="Grant Morrison. Batman #676">Grant Morrison. ''Batman'' #676</ref> and thus the grandson of [[Ra's al Ghul]]. [[Terry McGinnis]] and his brother Matt are the biological sons of Bruce Wayne and Mary McGinnis in the [[DC animated universe]], and Terry has taken over the role as Batman when Bruce has become too old to do so.

==== Romantic interests ====
Writers have varied in the approach over the years to the "playboy" aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona. Some writers show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman, while others have depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the benefits of being "Gotham's most eligible bachelor". Bruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically linked with many women throughout his various incarnations. The most significant relationships occurred with Selina Kyle, who is also [[Catwoman]]<ref name="ReferenceC">geek-news.mtv.com/2011/03/22/batman's-top-10-love-interests/{{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref> and [[Talia al Ghul]], as both women gave birth to his biological offsprings, Helena Wayne and Damian Wayne, respectively.

Batman's first romantic interest was [[Julie Madison]] in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #31 (September 1939); however, their romance was short-lived. Some of Batman's romantic interests have been women with a respected status in society, such as [[Julie Madison]], [[Vicki Vale]], and [[Silver St. Cloud]]. Batman has also been romantically involved with allies, such as [[Batwoman#Kathy Kane|Kathy Kane (Batwoman)]], [[Sasha Bordeaux]], and [[Wonder Woman]], and with villains, such as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle (Catwoman)]], Jezebel Jet, [[Poison Ivy (character)|Pamela Isley (Poison Ivy)]], and [[Talia al Ghul]].

;Catwoman
{{Main|Catwoman}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Catwoman art.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Catwoman]] is Batman's most enduring romance,<ref name="Love Interests" /> art by [[Adam Hughes]]]] -->
While most of Batman's romantic relationships tend to be short in duration, [[Catwoman]] has been his most enduring romance throughout the years.<ref name="Love Interests">{{cite web | title = Batman's Top 10 Love Interests | work = MTV News | date = March 22, 2011 | access-date = May 1, 2016 | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/2621111/batmans-top-10-love-interests/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160410030145/http://www.mtv.com/news/2621111/batmans-top-10-love-interests/ | archive-date = April 10, 2016 }}</ref> The attraction between Batman and Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear, including a love story between their two secret identities as early as in the 1966 film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]''. Although Catwoman is typically portrayed as a villain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic connection.

In an early 1980s storyline, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as "Bruce". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Out of costume, Bruce and Selina develop a romantic relationship during ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]''. The story shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the 12-issue story arc called "[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, "Hush" sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the entire [[List of Batman family enemies#Classic rogues gallery|rogues gallery]] and rekindling their romantic relationship. In "Hush", Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.

The [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world, partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Selina Kyle, as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211. They have a daughter named [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who becomes the Huntress. Along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]], the Huntress takes the role as Gotham's protector once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.

Batman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on the roof of a building in ''Catwoman'' vol. 4 #1 (2011); the same issue implies that the two have an ongoing sexual relationship.<ref name="Catwoman #1 September 2011">''Catwoman'' vol. 4 #1 (September 2011)</ref> Following the 2016 ''DC Rebirth'' continuity reboot, the two once again have a sexual encounter on top of a building in ''Batman'' vol. 3 #14 (2017).<ref name="Batman' 2017">''Batman'' vol. 3 #14 (March 2017)</ref>

''Batman'' vol. 3 Annual #2 (January 2018) centers on a romantic storyline between Batman and Catwoman. Towards the end, the story is flash-forwarded to the future, in which Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle are a married couple in their golden years.

=== Skills and training ===
Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess".<ref name="Wright_p17" /> Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient [[scientist]], he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage.

Superman describes Batman as "the most dangerous man on Earth", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extra-terrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first storyline in ''JLA''.

Batman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist most forms of [[telepathy]] and [[mind control]]. He is a master of [[disguise]], multilingual, and an expert in [[espionage]], often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone. Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and [[escapology]], which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable [[Deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]] with little to no harm.

Batman is an expert in [[interrogation]] techniques and his [[Intimidation|intimidating]] and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the [[Batplane]]), as well as being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he underwent some magician training.

=== Technology ===
Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian [[Les Daniels]] credits [[Gardner Fox]] with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the [[batarang]] and the "Batgyro" in ''Detective Comics'' #31 and 32 (Sept. and October 1939).<ref name="vapzdg" />

;Personal armor
{{Main|Batsuit}}
Batman's [[batsuit]] aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both [[Kevlar]] and [[Nomex]]. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts, and incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.<ref name="A1">{{harvp|Daniels|1999}}{{Page needed|date=February 2021}}</ref>

The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists' interpretations, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=98}}</ref> The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, "We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same&nbsp;...Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it."<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|pp=159–60}}</ref>

Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.<ref name="A1" /> Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey;<ref name="A1" /> as well as black and grey. In the [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle. [[Ben Affleck]]'s Batman in the [[DC Extended Universe]] films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.

;Batmobile
{{Main|Batmobile}}
[[File:USD205998.png|thumb|The 1966 television Batmobile, built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] from a [[Lincoln Futura]] [[concept car]]]]
Batman's primary vehicle is the [[Batmobile]], which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] that suggest a bat's wings.

Batman also has an aircraft called the [[Batplane]] (later called the "Batwing"), along with various other means of transportation.

In proper practice, the "bat" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' live-action television show]] and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series) stretched the practice to [[Camp (style)|campy]] proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a [[Batboat]], [[Bat-Sub]], and [[Batcycle]], among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such "bat-" names as the Bat-computer, Bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-[[shark repellent]] bat-spray, and Bat-rope. The storyline "A Death in the Family" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the "bat" prefix on his own. In ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', Batman tells [[Carrie Kelley]] that the original Robin came up with the name "Batmobile" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle.

The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics [[The New 52|relaunched]] its entire line of comic books, with the Batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics.

;Utility belt
{{Main|Batman's utility belt}}
Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his [[Batman's utility belt|utility belt]]. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it.

Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City.

An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are hand [[gun]]s, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents' murder. In modern stories in terms of his vehicles, Batman compromises on that principle to install weapon systems on them for the purpose of non-lethally disabling other vehicles, forcing entry into locations and attacking dangerous targets too large to defeat by other means.

;Bat-Signal
{{Main|Bat-Signal}}
When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a [[searchlight]] with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.

In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]], Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, [[Wayne Manor]], specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.

;Batcave
{{Main|Batcave}}
The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of caves beneath his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]]. As his command center, the Batcave serves multiple purposes; supercomputer, surveillance, redundant power-generators, forensics lab, medical infirmary, private study, training dojo, fabrication workshop, arsenal, hangar and garage. It houses the vehicles and equipment Batman uses in his campaign to fight crime. It is also a trophy room and storage facility for Batman's unique memorabilia collected over the years from various cases he has worked on.

In both the comic book ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #45 and the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the cave is said to have been part of the [[Underground Railroad]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Batman's history has undergone many [[retroactive continuity]] revisions, both minor and major. Elements of the character's history have varied greatly. Scholars [[William Uricchio]] and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, "Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades."<ref>''Batman'' vol. 3 Annual #2 (January 2018)</ref>

=== 20th century ===

==== Origin ====
{{Main|Origin of Batman}}
[[File:Thomas Wayne 1939.png|thumb|right|[[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]] are shot by Joe Chill in ''Detective Comics'' #33 (November 1939), art by Bob Kane]]
The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's [[origin story]].<ref name="pearson pg 186" /> As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] and his wife [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], murdered with a gun by a mugger named [[Joe Chill]]. Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, "Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number",<ref name="pearson pg 186">Pearson; Uricchio. "'I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise.'" p. 186.</ref> a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.<ref name="pearson pg 191">Pearson, p. 191.</ref>

==== Golden Age ====
{{See also|Batman (Earth-Two)}}
In Batman's first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story=The Case of the Chemical Syndicate|title=Detective Comics #27|date=May 1939|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Batman's origin is first presented in ''Detective Comics'' #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in ''Batman'' #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable [[Gotham City]] socialites. Bruce is brought up in [[Wayne Manor]], and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of 8, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named [[Joe Chill]] while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot", Wayne remarks, "so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible&nbsp;..." As if responding to his desires, a [[bat]] suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Bill Finger|penciller=Bob Kane|story=The Batman Wars Against the Dirigible of Doom|title=Detective Comics|issue=#33|date=November 1939|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

In early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne has a fiancé named [[Julie Madison]].<ref>She first appears in ''Detective Comics'' #31 (September 1939)</ref> In ''Detective Comics'' #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, [[Dick Grayson]], who becomes his vigilante partner, [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. Batman also becomes a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]],<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Paul Levitz]]|penciller=[[Joe Staton]]|story=The Untold Origin of the Justice Society |title=DC Special|issue=#29|date=September 1977|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> although he, like Superman, is an honorary member,<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Gardner Fox]]|penciller= |story= |title=[[All Star Comics]]|issue=#3|date=Winter 1940/1941|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of [[Gotham City Police Department|Gotham City's police department]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story= |title=Batman|issue=#7|date=November 1941|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> During this time, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as their butler.<ref>''Batman'' #16 (May 1943); his original last name, Beagle, is revealed in ''Detective Comics'' #96 (February 1945)</ref>

==== Silver Age ====
The [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as a new, updated version of the [[Flash (DC Comics character)|Flash]]. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as [[Earth-One]]. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.

After the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman (Selina Kyle). The two have a daughter, [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]], once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles, however, often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike the Flash or [[Green Lantern]], Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age.<ref>One example is the Englehart/Rogers run of the late 1970s, which has editorial notes directing readers to issues such as ''Detective Comics'' #46 and ''Batman'' #1 and 59.</ref> Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in ''Batman'' #208 (February 1969)) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=The First Batman|title=Detective Comics|issue=#235|date=September 1956|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmond Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Dick Sprang]]|story=When Batman Was Robin|title=Detective Comics|issue=#226|date=December 1955|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> In 1980, then-editor [[Paul Levitz]] commissioned the ''Untold Legend of the Batman'' [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.

Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the [[Justice League]] of America, Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''The Brave and the Bold'' became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different [[DC Universe]] superhero each month.

==== Bronze Age ====
In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]] into a [[penthouse apartment]] atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. In 1974's "Night of the Stalker" storyline, a diploma on the wall reveals Bruce Wayne as a graduate of [[Yale Law School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Batman went to Yale|url=https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/3113-why-batman-went-to-yale|access-date=2020-08-15|website=yalealumnimagazine.com|language=en|archive-date=February 13, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220213091414/https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/3113-why-batman-went-to-yale|url-status=live}}</ref> Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal [[Psychopathy|psychopath]], and the arrival of [[Ra's al Ghul]], a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes [[Nightwing]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 40–44 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>

In the final issue of ''The Brave and the Bold'' in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. He serves as the team's leader until ''Batman and the Outsiders'' #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.

==== Modern Age ====
After the 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline "[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]" from ''Batman'' #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.<ref>{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Frank | author-link = Frank Miller| author2 = David Mazzucchelli |author3=Richmond Lewis | title =Batman: Year One | publisher = DC Comics| year = 1987 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-1-85286-077-6| author2-link = David Mazzucchelli | title-link = Batman: Year One }}</ref> Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the Post-''Crisis'' universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following ''Crisis'', DC launched a new Batman title called ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the "Year One" period.

Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crimefighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when [[Tim Drake]] becomes the new Robin.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]|penciller=[[Norm Breyfogle]]|story=Master of Fear|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|issue=#457|date=December 1990|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been intertitle crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]". During the storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] to take on the role. After the end of "Knightfall", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in "KnightsEnd", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.<ref>Dixon, Chuck. et al. "Batman: Prodigal". ''Batman'' #512–514, ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #32–34, ''Detective Comics'' #679–681, ''Robin'' vol. 4 #11–13. New York: DC Comics, 1995.</ref>

The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!]]'' changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.

Batman once again becomes a member of the [[Justice League]] during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled ''JLA''. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's "[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]".

Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of "Batman: Officer Down" and "Batman: War Games/War Crimes"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] are forced out of the police department in "Officer Down", while "War Games" and "War Crimes" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]] the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. [[Lex Luthor]] arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper Lynd (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the "Bruce Wayne: Murderer?" and "[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]" story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as "Checkmate" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from [[Talia al Ghul]] in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #1–6.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s ====
DC Comics' 2005 [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' reveals that JLA member [[Zatanna]] had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from [[Lobotomy|lobotomizing]] [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] after he raped [[Sue Dibny]]. Batman later creates the [[OMACs|Brother I]] satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for the Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother EYE and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.

Following ''Infinite Crisis'', Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to "rebuild Batman".<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7, p. 32</ref> In the ''[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]'' storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence.

Bruce publicly announced that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as "Batman, Incorporated". However, due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, ''[[The New 52]]'', Dick Grayson was restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch also interrupted the publication of ''Batman, Incorporated'', which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit the new status quo.

=== The New 52 ===
During ''The New 52'', all of DC's continuity was reset and the timeline was changed, making Batman the first superhero to emerge. This emergence took place during ''Zero Year'', where Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham and becomes Batman, fighting the original Red Hood<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Scott|title=Batman Vol. 4: Zero Year- Secret City|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> and the Riddler.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Scott|title=Batman Vol 5: Zero Year- Dark City|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> In the present day, Batman discovers the [[Court of Owls]], a secret organization operating in Gotham for decades.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Scott|title=Batman Vol. 1: The Court of Owls|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Batman somewhat defeats the Court by defeating Owlman,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Scott|title=Batman Vol. 2: The City of Owls|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> although the Court continues to operate on a smaller scale.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Scott|title=Batman Vol. 10: Epilogue|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> The Joker returns after losing the skin on his face (as shown in the opening issue of the second volume of ''Detective Comics'') and attempts to kill the Batman's allies, though he is stopped by Batman.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Scott|title=Batman Vol. 3: Death of the Family|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> After some time, Joker returns again, and both he and Batman die while fighting each other.

=== DC Rebirth ===
The timeline was reset again during ''Rebirth'', although no significant changes were made to the Batman mythos. {{citation needed|date=March 2022}} Batman meets two new superheroes operating in Gotham named Gotham and Gotham Girl. [[Psycho-Pirate]] gets into Gotham's head and turns against Batman, and is finally defeated when he is killed. This event is very traumatic for Gotham Girl and she begins to lose her sanity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=King|first=Tom|title=Batman Vol. 1: I Am Gotham|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

Batman forms his own [[Suicide Squad]], including Catwoman, and attempts to take down [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]].

It is revealed that the Joker who was working for Bane was really [[Clayface]] in disguise. The real Joker has been plotting a master plan to take over Gotham. This plan comes to fruition during ''The Joker War'', in which Joker takes over the city. Batman defeats the Joker who vanishes after an explosion.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tynion IV|first=James|title=Batman Vol. 2: The Joker War|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Ghost-Maker, an enemy from Batman's past, appears in Gotham, and, after a battle, becomes a sort of ally to Batman.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tynion IV|first=James|title=Batman Vol. 3: Ghost Stories|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> A new group called the Magistrate rises up in Gotham, led by Simon Saint, whose goal is to outlaw vigilantes such as Batman.

During ''Fear State'', Batman battles and defeats both Scarecrow and the Magistrate's Peacekeepers.

== Other versions ==

=== ''Citizen Wayne'' ===
In ''Batman: Citizen Wayne'', the role of Batman is taken on by [[Harvey Dent]] after his whole face has been destroyed by an enemy. Bruce Wayne is a newspaper publisher who is highly critical of Batman and his brutal methods and goes after him when he actually kills the enemy in question, both men dying in the final battle.

=== ''DC Bombshells'' ===
In the opening of the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity set during World War II, Bruce's parents are saved from Joe Chill's attack thanks to the baseball superheroine known as Batwoman. While Batman does not exist in this continuity, Kate Kane does borrow a number of elements from the main version, such as inspiring younger heroines to follow in her steps as Batgirls and losing a child named Jason. In the book's conclusion that takes place 15 years into the future, a grown up Bruce Wayne becomes Batman (not out of tragedy but out of inspiration by the Bombshells) and is trained by the older Catwoman to herald in the new age of superheroes.<ref>''DC Bombshells'' #1</ref>

=== ''The Dark Knight Returns'' ===
{{further|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns}}
The Batman from [[Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and its spin-offs, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' and ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'' is a tired vigilante in a much darker, edgier setting home to Miller's own new interpretations of various DC characters.

=== The Dark Multiverse ===
In the 2017 ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'' event, it is revealed that a Dark Multiverse exists alongside the main DC Multiverse. Each reality in the Dark Multiverse is negative and transient reflection of its existing counterpart, which were intended to be acquired by a third figure in the 'trinity' of the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor, who would feed these timelines to his 'dragon', Barbatos. However, this balance came to an end when Barbatos escaped his bonds and allowed the rejected timelines to remain in some form of existence. Eventually, Barbatos is released onto the DC universe when Batman is treated with five unique metals, turning him into a portal to the Dark Multiverse, with this portal also allowing Barbatos to summon an army of evil alternate Batmen known as the Dark Knights, led by a God-like Batman, who describe themselves as having been created based on Batman's dark imaginations of what he could do if he possessed the powers of his colleagues.

*'''Barbatos''' is a hooded, God-like being in the Dark Multiverse. Barbatos had previously visited Prime-Earth in the DC Multiverse and founded the Tribe of Judas, which would later become the [[Court of Owls]]. Sometime before returning (either willingly or not) to the Dark Multiverse, Barbatos encountered Hawkman/Carter Hall, and was hit by his mace. Barbatos tried to return to the Multiverse but the events of ''Final Crisis'' prevented him from doing so. However, after witnessing Bruce Wayne/Batman being sent back in time by Darkseid's Omega Beams, Barbatos realised the similarities between his and Bruce's Bat emblems and believed he could use him as a doorway. Barbatos' followers manipulated events in order for Bruce to be injected with four out of the five metals needed to create the doorway, and after the fifth was injected in the present day, Barbatos was able to transport himself and the Dark Knights to Prime-Earth to conquer it.<ref>''Dark Nights: Metal'' #1-2</ref>
*'''[[The Batman Who Laughs]]''' is a version of Batman from Earth -22, a dark reflection of the Earth-22. In that reality, the Earth -22 Joker learned of Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne and killed most of Batman's other rogues along with Commissioner Gordon. He then subjected a sizeable population of Gotham's populace to the chemicals that transformed him, subsequently killing several parents in front of their children with the goal of turning them into essentially a combination of himself and Batman. When Batman grappled with the Joker, it resulted in the latter's death as Batman is exposed to a purified form of the chemicals that gradually turned him into a new Joker, the process proving irreversible by the time Batman discovered what was happening to him. The Batman who Laughs proceeded to take over Earth-22, killing off most of his allies and turning Damian into a mini-Joker. The Batman Who Laughs seems to be the de facto leader or second-in-command of Barbatos' Dark Knights and recruited the other members. After arriving on Prime-Earth, the Batman Who Laughs takes control of Gotham and oversees events at the Challenger's mountain. He distributes joker cards to the Batman's Rogues, giving them the ability to alter reality and take over sections of the city. Accompanying him are Damian and three other youths whom he also calls his sons, all four being twisted versions of Robin, having intended to destroy all of reality by linking the Over-Monitor to Anti-Monitor's astral brain. But The Batman Who Laughs is defeated when the Prime Universe Batman is aided by the Joker, who notes the alternate Batman's failure to perceive this scenario due to still being a version of Batman. While assumed dead, the Batman who Laughs is revealed to be in the custody of Lex Luthor who offers him a place in the Legion of Doom.
*'''{{anchor|The Red Death}}The Red Death''' is a version of Batman from Earth -52, originally an aged man who broke after the deaths of Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian. Believing he has a chance to prevent the loss of more loved ones, Bruce decides he needs the Flash's Speed Force to achieve this and equipped himself with the Rogues' equipment of capture the Flash. He is able to knock Barry out and ties him to the Batmobile which has a machine created from reverse-engineering the Cosmic Treadmill attached to it. Using this machine against Barry's wishes, Bruce drove straight into the Speed Force while absorbing Barry in the process. Scarred by the ordeal, he developed a split-personality created from residual traces of the Earth -52 Barry's mind. The newly-born Red Death tests his new powers but realises he cannot stop his Earth from its destruction until he is recruited by The Batman Who Laughs, who promises him a new Earth to live upon. After entering Prime-Earth, the Red Death arrives in Central City and is confronted by Iris West and Wally West, in which he uses his powers to slow Wally and age them both. The Flash confronts the Red Death and before the latter can attack, Doctor Fate saves Barry. The Red Death proclaims that he will save Central City and make it his new home.<ref>''Batman: The Red Death'' #1</ref> After Barry is transported to a 'sand'-filled cave beneath Central City, the Red Death arrives and reveals several Flashmobiles and chases after Barry.<ref name="Justice League vol. 3 #33">''Justice League'' vol. 3 #33</ref> During the events of the ''Wild Hunt'', the Red Death ceased when exposed by an energy wave from the release of a newly born universe with the restored -52 Barry eventually destroyed from the energy consuming him.
*'''The Murder Machine''' is a version of Batman from Earth -44, a dark reflection of the Earth-44. Distraught from having lost Alfred, Batman requested Cyborg to help him finish the Alfred Protocol, an A.I. version of Alfred. But the Alfred Protocol malfunctioned upon activation and began to multiply and kill all of Batman's Rogues Gallery. Bruce pleaded with Cyborg to help find a way to fix it but the latter refused. The Alfred Protocol began to merge with Bruce and the two became the Murder Machine, and his first act as this new entity was to kill Cyborg. After being recruited by the Batman Who Laughs, the Murder Machine arrives on Prime-Earth with the other Dark Knights. He proceeds to the Justice League's Watchtower and confronts Cyborg. After Cyborg is incapacitated by the other Dark Knights, the Murder Machine infects and converts the Watchtower as the Dark Knights' new base of operations.<ref>''Batman: The Murder Machine'' #1</ref>
*'''The Dawnbreaker''' is a version of Batman from Earth -32, a dark reflection of the Earth-32 where [[Batman: In Darkest Knight|Batman became a Green Lantern]]. When Earth -32 Bruce lost his parents to Joe Chill, he is chosen by a Green Power Ring to become a Green Lantern. But Bruce's will overrides the ring's ban on lethal force and corrupts it, enabling him to use it to kill Chill and various criminals. After Bruce killed Gordon when eventually confronted, he wipes out the Green Lantern Corp and the Guardians of the Universe when they confront him. Bruce then entered his giant Green Lantern Power Battery and exits with a new outfit and moniker, the Dawnbreaker. However, he finds that his Earth has begun to collapse and he is met by the Batman Who Laughs who, after recruiting the Red Death and the Murder Machine, recruits the Dawnbreaker, promising him a new world to shroud in darkness. After arriving on Earth-0, Dawnbreaker heads to Coast City where he is confronted by Hal Jordan. Dawnbreaker tries to consume Hal Jordan in a 'blackout' but the latter is rescued by Doctor Fate. With Green Lantern gone, Dawnbreaker takes control of Coast City.<ref>''Batman: The Dawnbreaker'' #1, ''Dark Nights: Metal'' #2</ref> The Dawnbreaker confronts Hal Jordan in a blacked out cave underneath Coast City, claiming that the Green Lantern oath is worthless in his cave.<ref name="Justice League vol. 3 #33"/>
*'''The Drowned''' is a version of Batman from [[Earth-11]], a dark reflection of the reversed-gender Earth-11. Originally known as Batwoman, Bryce Wayne was in a relationship with Sylvester Kyle (Earth-11's male version of Selina Kyle) until he was killed by a metahuman. A revenge-driven Bryce spent 18 months hunting down every rogue metahuman before Aquawoman and the Atlanteans emerged from their self-imposed exile. While Aquawoman claimed her people came in peace, a skeptical Bryce declared war on Atlantis with the Atlanteans flooding Gotham in retaliation when their queen was killed. Bryce survived the disaster by performing auto-surgery on herself by introducing mutated hybrid DNA into her body, giving Bryce the ability to breath underwater, accelerated healing, and water manipulation. She also created an army of Dead Waters to fight for her. Donning a new attire, Bryce called herself The Drowned and successfully conquered Atlantis at the cost of flooding every city. After seeing her signal being lit, the Drowned met the Batman Who Laughs, who recruits her as a Dark Knight. After arriving on Earth-0, the Drowned headed to Amnesty Bay, where she was confronted by Aquaman and Mera. The two were unable to combat the Drowned and her army of Dead Waters, with Mera becoming infected and controlled by the Drowned while Aquaman was saved by Doctor Fate. The Drowned proceeded to take control of Amnesty Bay.<ref>''Batman: The Drowned'' #1</ref> When Aquaman is transported fathoms below Amnesty Bay, the Drowned attacks him, revealing that the infected Mera has mutated into a gargantuan shark/crab/octopus creature.<ref name="Justice League vol. 3 #33"/>
*'''The Merciless''' is a version of Batman from Earth -12. Here Batman is in a relationship with Wonder Woman. Having killed [[Ares]] in a fit of rage when Ares presumably kills Wonder woman , the Earth -12 Batman acquired Ares's helmet and assumed that he can channel its power to war with justice and mercy rather than ruthless brutality. But it corrupted him and the 'Merciless' Batman ended up killing Wonder Woman (who had actually just been knocked out) while eliminating all his enemies. The Merciless is later depicted as destroying the Valhalla Mountain when [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]], [[Amanda Waller]], [[Steve Trevor]] and [[Mister Bones]] attempt a counter-attack against the Dark Batmen after the regular heroes have apparently failed.<ref>''Batman: The Merciless'' #1</ref> The Merciless confronts Wonder Woman after she is transported under the foundation of A.R.G.U.S Headquarters in Washington D.C., revealing his armory filled with the divine arsenal of the Gods he killed on his Earth. He reveals to her that his Diana taught him to fight and after he destroyed the Gods, the Merciless found Themyscria and fought them for three days. The Merciless also reveals that he ordered the Ferryman at the River Styx to gather every coin from every dead Amazon seeking passage into the afterlife which he melted into a giant golden drachma, which he strikes with a hammer, summoning the undead Amazons.<ref name="Justice League vol. 3 #33"/>
*'''The Devastator''' is a version of Batman from Earth -1, a dark reflection of Earth-1. When Superman turned evil and kills friend and foe alike along with Lois, the Earth-1 Batman injected himself with an engineered version of the Doomsday virus to stop the Kryptonian at the cost of his humanity as he transformed into a Doomsday-like monster. Despite his victory, the Devastator still feels remorse for not being able to protect Metropolis from Superman's wrath. The Batman Who Laughs offers The Devastator a second chance at saving those whom he feels are blindly inspired by Superman. Bruce infects the Earth-0 Lois Lane, Supergirl, and all of Metropolis with the Doomsday virus as he views it as the only way to protect them from Superman's strength and false prophecies.<ref name="Batman: The Devastator #1">''Batman: The Devastator'' #1</ref> Along with the Murder Machine, the Devastator was sent to retrieve the Cosmic Tuning Tower, ripping it out of its foundation and throwing it outside the Fortress of Solitude.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 5 #33</ref> He is then confronted by the two Green Lanterns of Earth (Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz), The Flash/Wally West, Firestorm, and Lobo and he proceeds to incapacitate all except Lobo who he throws into the Sun. Grabbing the Cosmic Tuning Tower, the Devastator leaps into space and lands on the Challenger's Mountain, planting the tower on top of it.<ref name="Batman: The Devastator #1"/>

=== ''Injustice: Gods Among Us'' ===
In ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Batman was originally close friends with Superman (with Superman even asking him to be godfather to his child with Lois Lane) but when Superman was tricked by the Joker into killing Lois and destroying Metropolis, their relationship slowly went from estranged to antagonistic to enemies. Superman begins a new world order where he and the Justice League use brute force and fear to coerce people into following the law, but Batman sees the tyranny in this and opposes Superman's Regime with his Insurgency. He suffers a few losses, notably of Dick Grayson by the hands of his biological son Damian (albeit by accident), who sided with Superman. By the end of Year One Superman breaks Batman's back in an attempt to delay any future defiance. During most of Year Two Batman is out of commission, relying on his allies to stop the Regime when the Green Lantern Corps gets involved. In Year Three Batman allies himself with magic-users, notably John Constantine, though this ends with Constantine revealed to have been using Batman to further his own goals. Year Four has Batman look to the Greek gods to stop Superman. However, he comes to regret this when the gods decide to overpower humanity themselves, leading him to enlist the New God Highfather to stop them. He evades a trap set up by Superman when the fallen hero tries to make a meeting to discuss their problems. By the game's events, Batman has suffered many losses by the hands of the Regime and in a last-ditch effort summons the counterparts of Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, and Aquaman from the mainstream universe, needing them to help him retrieve a shard of kryptonite from his now-abandoned Batcave; the kryptonite was meant to be a last resort for if Superman went rogue, but Batman made it he could only access it if key members of the League agreed. Since most of them allied with Superman who are dead (Green Arrow) he needed duplicates. When this plan fails, he is reluctant to bring over the mainstream Superman, convinced that any version of Superman is corruptible. However, his prime counterpart convinces him to have faith and he does so, with the mainstream Superman defeating his counterpart and ending the Regime's influence.

=== ''JLA/Avengers'' ===
In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Batman appears along with his teammates in the [[Justice League]], when they are made to fight the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s cosmic game. While touring the [[Marvel Universe]] for the first time, Batman witnesses the [[Punisher]] killing a gang of drug dealers, and attacks him (the fight takes place off-panel). He later forms an alliance with [[Captain America]] after engaging in a brief fistfight to test his opponent's skills. Due to this alliance, he realizes the stakes of the game and loses it for the JLA. When the two universes are merged by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]], the heroes are left confused as to what actually occurred in their reality; the Grandmaster clarifies by showing them the various tragedies that befell the heroes in their lifetimes. Batman, for his part, witnesses Jason Todd's death and his injury at the hands of Bane. In the final battle, Krona defeats the JLA with minor difficulty, but is defeated when the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Clint Barton|Hawkeye]] disrupt his control of his power source.

=== ''Just Imagine'' ===
{{see also|Just Imagine...}}
''Just Imagine...'' is a series of comics created by [[Stan Lee]] (the co-creator of several [[Marvel Comics]] characters), with reimaginings of various DC characters. 
In this continuity, Wayne Williams is framed for a crime he did not commit, and becomes Batman in a combination of Batman and [[Spider-Man]]'s origin stories.

=== ''Kingdom Come'' ===
The ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' limited series depicts a Batman who, ravaged by years of fighting crime, uses an [[powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]] to keep himself together and keeps the peace on the streets of Gotham using remote-controlled robots. He is late middle-aged and wears an eerie grin. It is no longer a secret that he is Bruce Wayne and is referred to as the "Batman" even when he appears in civilian guise.

=== ''Superman: American Alien'' ===
In ''Superman: American Alien'', a 2016 comic that shows an alternate retelling of Superman's origin, Bruce Wayne is training under [[Ra's al Ghul]] when he is told about someone posing as him at a birthday party thrown for him, causing Bruce to become interested in this person. Years later, having been Batman for a while, he finds out that the same person, revealed to be [[Superman|Clark Kent]], is a reporter who spoke to Bruce's new ward [[Dick Grayson]]. Donning his costume, Bruce confronts Clark but is quickly overpowered, and is shocked when none of his equipment harms Clark. Clark finds out Bruce's identity by taking his mask and cape, and Bruce escapes. He seemingly leaves behind Clark's recording of his conversation with Dick, and Clark does not reveal Bruce's double life to the public. Bruce's cape later becomes part of Clark's prototype costume as he first begins his crime fighting career.

==="Batman:  White Knight" ===
In this reality, Bruce has grown up believing he is a descendant of Malcolm Wayne, the founder of Gotham City.  In reality, though, he is actually a descendant of Dakkar, a man who'd murdered Malcolm Wayne and assumed his identity.  Jean-Paul Valley, aka Azrael, is actually the real Wayne descendant, which Bruce only learns from Jack Napier right before Jack forces Harley Quinn to kill him as the Joker will not let him kill himself.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
Batman has become a [[Popular culture|pop culture]] icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989 ''Batman'' film and its accompanying merchandising "brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness".<ref name="introduction">Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William.

The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October 25, 1943.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=50}}</ref> That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part [[Serial film|serial]] ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'', with [[Lewis Wilson]] becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made occasional guest appearances in ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor [[Bud Collyer]] needed time off.<ref name="Dan99p64">{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=64}}</ref> A second movie serial, ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'', followed in 1949, with [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]] taking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s "helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who never bought a comic book".<ref name="Dan99p64" />

In the 1964 publication of [[Donald Barthelme]]'s collection of short stories ''Come Back, Dr. Caligari'', Barthelme wrote "The Joker's Greatest Triumph". Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Olsen |first1=Lance |title=Linguistic Pratfalls in Barthelme |journal=[[South Atlantic Review]] |date=November 1986 |volume=51 |issue=#4 |pages=69–77 |doi=10.2307/3199757 |jstor=3199757}}</ref>

==== Television ====
The ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, starring [[Adam West]], premiered in January 1966 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. Inflected with a [[Camp (style)|camp]] sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, ''Back to the Batcave'', West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a [[farce]] or [[Parody|lampoon]], and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes, ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the ''Batman'' television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966). [[The Who]] recorded the theme song from the ''Batman'' show for their 1966 EP ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'', and [[The Kinks]] performed the theme song on their 1967 album ''[[Live at Kelvin Hall]]''. Adam West also appeared in character as Batman in several commercials and a 1966 US Government PSA for Savings Bonds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_MYms0wUmQ |title=Batman Sells U.S. Savings Stamps and Bonds (1966) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2022-07-13}}</ref> Despite not having an immediate continuation, the series spawned a (failed) [[pilot episode]] for a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''Batgirl'' television series and, decades later, the ''[[Batman '66]]'' (2013-2016) comic book series, the animated films ''[[Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders]]'' (2016) and ''[[Batman vs. Two-Face]]'' (2017), and even the [[mockumentary]] ''[[Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt]]'' (2003).

In the 1996 episode ''[[Heroes and Villains (Only Fools and Horses)|Heroes and Villains]]'' of ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', [[David Jason]] spoofed the role of Batman.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1367383/only-fools-and-horses-news-david-jason-bbc-batman-robin-nicholas-lyndhurst-leak-tv-uk-spt|title = Only Fools and Horses: David Jason's warning to BBC over Batman and Robin scene leak|date = December 2, 2020|access-date = March 9, 2021|archive-date = March 2, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210302020614/https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1367383/only-fools-and-horses-news-david-jason-bbc-batman-robin-nicholas-lyndhurst-leak-tv-uk-spt|url-status = live}}</ref>

The popularity of the ''Batman'' TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'';{{sfnp|Boichel|1991|p=14}} the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]'' and ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'' which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's ''[[Super Friends]]'' series, which was animated by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. [[Olan Soule]] was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during ''Super Friends'' by Adam West, who also voiced the character in [[Filmation]]'s 1977 series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.

In 1992, ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television network, produced by [[Warner Bros.

[[File:Keaton as Batman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Keaton]] as [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Batman]] in the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 film]].]]
As previously stated, Batman's first cinematic appearances consisted of the 1943 [[serial film]] ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'' and its 1949 sequel ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'', which were both released by [[Columbia Pictures]] and depicted a government-backed version of Batman and Robin (censorship at the time would not have allowed for [[vigilante]]s to be depicted as unauthorized crimefighters). The serials (especially the first one) are, though, notorious for their accentuation on [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s due to their [[World War II]]-period setting. In 1966, [[20th Century Fox]] released Batman's first feature-length film, titled ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (also advertised as ''Batman: The Movie''), based on and featuring most of the cast from the 1960s TV series.

In 1989, [[Warner Bros.]] released the feature film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', directed by [[Tim Burton]] and starring [[Michael Keaton]] as the title character. The film was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing film of the year, but at the time was the fifth highest-grossing film in history.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batman.htm | title= Batman (1989) | website=Box Office Mojo | access-date=May 27, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070513103130/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batman.htm| archive-date= May 13, 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref> The film also won the [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1223147717805 |title=Batman |work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |access-date=October 4, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=Brojam |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The film's success spawned three sequels: ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995) and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), the latter two of which were directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with [[Val Kilmer]] and [[George Clooney]], respectively.

===Interpretations===
====Gay interpretations====
{{Further|Homosexuality in the Batman franchise}}

Gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]] asserted in ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954 that "Batman stories are psychologically homosexual&nbsp;...The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious."<ref>Wertham, Fredric. ''Seduction of the Innocent''. Rinehart and Company, Inc., 1954. pp. 189–90.<br />For discussion of Wertham's impact see Brooker (2001).</ref> Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay "Batman, Deviance, and Camp" that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because "he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality".<ref>Medhurst, Andy. "Batman, Deviance, and Camp." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, p. 150.</ref> Professor of film and cultural studies [[Will Brooker]] argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character.<ref>Brooker, Will (2001) ''Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon'', Continuum. {{ISBN|978-1-62356-752-1}}, pp. 101 ff.</ref> In 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of [[watercolor]]s depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mark Chamberlain (American, 1967) |publisher=Artnet |url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/mark-chamberlain/past-auction-results|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309070124/http://www.artnet.com/artists/mark-chamberlain/past-auction-results|archive-date=March 9, 2014}}</ref> prompting DC to threaten legal action.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167032.stm | title=Gallery told to drop 'gay' Batman | work=BBC News Online | date=August 19, 2005| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104232835/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167032.stm | archive-date=November 4, 2013 }}</ref>

Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, "The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay&nbsp;...everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane&nbsp;...none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm | title=Is Batman Gay? | access-date=December 28, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201072032/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm | archive-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting so much so that he is "borderline pathological", concluding "He'd be much healthier if he ''were'' gay."<ref>Sharrett, p. 38.</ref> [[Grant Morrison]] said that "Gayness is built into Batman&nbsp;...Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120422174916/http://www.playboy.com/playground/entertainment/culture/the-super-psyche ''Playboy'' Grant Morrison interview], accessed May 2, 2012.</ref>

====Psychological interpretations====
{{Expand section|date=April 2019}}
Batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time, and there have been a number of interpretations into the character's psyche.

In ''Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight'', Dr. Travis Langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists [[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] is present in the Batman mythos, such that the character represents the "shadow archetype". This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own dark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself. Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil. Langley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our "shadow selves".<ref name="Langley">Langley, Travis.

"I could have called it something like the Psychology of Nocturnal Vigilantism, but no. I called it Batman," Langley says.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hendrix.edu/news/news.aspx?id=61460|title=Holy Psychology, Batman!|access-date=April 6, 2019|archive-date=July 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726144340/https://www.hendrix.edu/news/news.aspx?id=61460|url-status=live}}</ref>

Several psychologists have explored Bruce Wayne/Batman's mental health. Robin. S. Rosenberg evaluated his actions and problems to determine if they reach the level of mental disorders. She examined the possibility of several mental health issues, including [[dissociative identity disorder]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], and several others. She concluded that Bruce Wayne/Batman may have a disorder or a combination of disorders but due to his fictional nature, a definitive diagnosis will remain unknown.<ref name="Rosenberg">{{cite web|title=Batman's Mental Health, Part 1|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superheroes/201207/batmans-mental-health-part-1|last=Rosenberg|first=Robin S.|access-date=March 6, 2022|archive-date=March 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220306043451/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superheroes/201207/batmans-mental-health-part-1|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Carlson">{{cite web|title=Psychology Of Batman: Fictional Superhero Gets Troubling Real-Life Evaluation|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/276689/psychology-of-batman-fictional-superhero-gets-troubling-real-life-evaluation|last=Carlson|first=Dustin|date=January 24, 2019|access-date=March 6, 2022|archive-date=February 13, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220213083740/https://www.inquisitr.com/276689/psychology-of-batman-fictional-superhero-gets-troubling-real-life-evaluation/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Defife">{{cite web|title=Batman Psychological Disorders|url=https://flowpsychology.com/batman-psychological-disorders/|last=Defife|first=Jared|access-date=March 6, 2022|archive-date=February 13, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220213091411/https://flowpsychology.com/batman-psychological-disorders/|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Langley himself states in his book that Batman is far too functional and well-adjusted, due to his training, confrontation of his fear early on and other factors, to be mentally ill. More likely, he asserts Batman's mental attitude is far more in line with a dedicated Olympic athlete.
