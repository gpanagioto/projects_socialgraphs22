 Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill!  Okay.  ...Yeah. ...Like, you die. Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead. You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?! He's dead for sure. Oh my God...  We have to get out of here! Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail!  Come on, we have to leave!!
