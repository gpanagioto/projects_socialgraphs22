Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, "shit". Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form. You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  That's right out! Very good, Timmy. Yes, that's now fine.  Boys, watch your language! Shit!
