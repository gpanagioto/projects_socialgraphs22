 Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me? If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do. All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain. No, dude! You can't say "I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms." Hey, can we get more coffee over here?  Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains. Look at that. Another tortured soul. Hey Raven, check it out.  That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want. Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
