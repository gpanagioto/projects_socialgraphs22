 Eric, hey! I got us both chocolate milks. The pink and blue one?!  put it on me!  The show's on at five tonight if you want to watch it at your house or my house. Why? What's going on, Boo? Shut up. I don't even try to be funny. What? Babe, stop. I don't think he meant anything by it.  Look, Kyle, I think it's great you're trying to patch things up with everyone, but the truth is Eric and I are just kind of out of it now. We gave up social media and the ugliness that goes along with it and we're in a better place.
