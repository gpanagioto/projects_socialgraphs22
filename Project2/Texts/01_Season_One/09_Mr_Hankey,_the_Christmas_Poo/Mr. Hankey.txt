Howwwwdy-hoooo. Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell. You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers. Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? Howdy-ho! You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold. Aw, gee, that's too bad. Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas. Howdy-ho! Golly, that isn't very nice. I'd sure like to teach him a lesson. Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!! Kyle! Howdy-ho. Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!! Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery. Howdy-ho, Chef! What's all the ruckus? I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey! STOP FIGHTING!! Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies". Howdy-ho, Kyle!!! I brought some friends with me. Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas.
