Uhm'kay. Excuse me uh, I'm sorry, but uh, is anyone else hearing Hootie & The Blowfish like, very very softly? You wanted to see me, PC Principal? Well, she seems to be acclimating fine, ukay, the kids really respect her. What?? Are you out of your fuckin' mind?! Askin' if a coworker is available in today's times?! Oh boy, this is bad! This is real bad! Look, this is real fucking fire you're dealing with, uhkay?! I'm gonna get someone down here from HR! No! Human resources! The people that come in to make sure everything's kept on the level! We gotta get you back on track!  Uh m'kay. Mr. Mackey.  Good morning, uh, Miss Conduct. Yeah, yeah it was good. Oh, ah I'm very open and honest, I promise you that. Oh, I mostly use a semi-cognitive approach adapted by Kiezrick Solomon. Are you serious? Nobody I talked to has ever even heard of him! Well it's just such a na-natural approach, m'kay? When I read it, you know, first I was like "whoa, okay!" "This just really makes sense", you know?

Evens is always nice.
