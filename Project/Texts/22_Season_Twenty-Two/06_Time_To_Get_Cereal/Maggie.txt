Harrison Yates, where have ya been?! I haven't seen ya in days. I've missed you so much. Come have some supper with me. I just played a little bit. You're never home anymore! With all these school shootings! I need a life too, you know?! ISo I robbed a lumber mill in Monto's rest, upgraded my horse and got a sniper rifle. Why can't we have a life together?! Where are ya going?! You can;t possibly go all the way back to the snow level again!
