What madness is this??   just in time for Black Friday. You've murdered us!  I'll deal with these demons!  That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job. I see it in you. You care about people.  Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay. No, damn it!   Back away!  You did ''good''. The watch is yours now. This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend? Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this.
