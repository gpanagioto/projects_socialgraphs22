Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?! Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know! Yes. Yes. Yes. No! I am not no gay fish! I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man! Damn right I'm male. Yeah, I like fishsticks. Yeah. Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass!  There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills.  Doctor, do I have gills? You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions? Love 'em! No I'm not- AAAARGH!   Yo, fuck this noise, yo!  Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish? What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see...  Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish. Shut up!  Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims? I don't need anyone tellin' me "play on words"! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius! Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy? Found who? You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared. Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?! I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.  Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish? Why- Look at me, look at me!  Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play.  Tie up these motherfuckers!  Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?! Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started! What? I, I still don't get anything. He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me.  Untie them guys. I know what I have to do. It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me.  
Uh-huh. Uh-huh, that's right  That is not a hobbit pipe, for your information! It is a personal oral humidifier to keep all the wrinkles around her mouth from showin'. So haha, all you haters, HA!  Oh, you didn't think of that! Oh, I guess she's not a hobbit then! She must be a beautiful, sexy woman! Man, get the fuck out of here, you hobbit trivia bitch!  Bitch, if you're the hobbit, you need to let me know right now, 'cause I'm makin' a fool of myself out here!  I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. I'm sorry.  Sorry, hold up, I'm sorry, it's okay. Hold up, hold on, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, that's okay. I've been jelly before too. I'm sorry.
