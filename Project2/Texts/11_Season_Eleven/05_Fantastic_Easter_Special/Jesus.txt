 I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things. Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan. This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter ''was'' a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope. What are you doing?!  What is your problem, guy?! We'll never get out in time to stop him!  Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me. Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars. Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle! Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately. My son, there is no time! Do it! I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter. Awgh!  Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent! One man cannot be the voice of the Church! Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position.
