==Fictional character biography==
Madame Masque was born as Giulietta Nefaria, the daughter of the master criminal [[Count Nefaria|Count Luchino Nefaria]], in [[Rome, Italy]]. Her mother died when giving birth and Luchino wanted his daughter to lead a respectable life, so he gave the child to Byron Frost, a wealthy financier and an employee of Nefaria, and his wife Loretta Frost.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=128}}</ref>

Frost called the child Whitney and raised her as his own. As a young adult, Whitney was a debutante and socialite, and became engaged to politician Roger Vane. Following the Frosts' deaths, Count Nefaria approached Whitney and revealed her true parentage, as he wishes for her to inherit his position as head of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], a [[American Mafia|Mafia]]-like organization based on the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Whitney at first refused, but when she tells Roger about her father, Roger ends their relationship out of fear that her connections to a known criminal would hamper his political prospects. Heartbroken, Whitney accepted her father's offer to join the Maggia and was trained by the Count in strategy, criminal activities, and combat. She turned out to be a brilliant student and when her father is imprisoned, she becomes the new "Big M", the leader of the Nefaria family of the Maggia. Her role as Big M brought her into conflict with [[Iron Man]], an old enemy of Count Nefaria.<ref>''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #98. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Whitney was forced to flee after a raid on [[Stark Industries]]. The plane she escaped in crashed and Whitney's face was badly scarred, but she was saved by the criminal [[Midas (comics)|Mordecai Midas]] and started to work for him. Midas is obsessed with gold and gave Whitney a golden mask to conceal her disfigured face. She also starts using the alias of "Madame Masque."<ref>''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Madame Masque meets Tony Stark (Iron Man's [[alter ego]]) and the latter shows concern for her despite her scarred face. She turns on Midas to save Stark, but leaves him because of her criminal past. Unable to forget her feelings, she assumes the identity of Krissy Longfellow, Stark's personal secretary. Both come to know each other's true identity and start a romantic relationship. Their happiness is short-lived as Count Nefaria is dying due to a failed attempt to gain superhuman powers. Whitney hires the [[Ani-Men]] to bring her father to her and then asks Stark to find a cure for her father. Count Nefaria threatens Stark, and he is forced to fight the Ani-Men as Iron Man. Whitney is unable to choose between her father and her lover, and when Nefaria's life-support system is damaged in the fight, she goes insane with guilt and grief.<ref>''Iron Man'' #116-117. Marvel Comics.</ref> Whitney returns to the Nefaria family and regains her former position as leader. She resumes her vendetta against Iron Man and his friends.<ref>''Iron Man'' #137-139. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At one point, Frost becomes [[Paranoia|paranoid]] and starts to create physical copies of herself, known as bio-duplicates. One of her bio-duplicates, who is simply referred to as "Masque", turns on her creator and becomes an ally of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #397. Marvel Comics.</ref> She also creates robotic servants known as the ''Inner Guard'' and names them individually after notable historical traitors: Benedict, Brutus, Fawkes, Quisling, Monmouth (based on [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Vidkun Quisling]], and the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]]) and two other, unnamed members.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #32. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/innerguardmasque.htm|Inner Guard}} Retrieved 19.July 2013</ref>

Benedict successfully recaptures Masque for Whitney. Masque tries to convince her the Avengers are benevolent and that she should reach out to Stark again, but Whitney is still too fearful to do so. She continues to be a criminal figure of importance, until her father returns from the dead, now with superhuman abilities, and destroys her base. She reluctantly assists the Avengers and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] against the Count, but she secretly plans to betray and destroy both sides, her increased paranoia causing her to believe that she can trust no one but herself, despite moments of doubt such as when Stark unmasks in her presence but lowers his face-plate back when preparing to talk to the rest of the Avengers.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Masque again tries unsuccessfully to convince her to side with the heroes, then joins the battle in Whitney's place. Masque obtains a weapon designed to disrupt Nefaria's powers that Whitney had prepared for her father, but is slain by Nefaria before she can use it. Madame Masque is shocked by her duplicate's nobility and sacrifice, with Iron Man's dismayed reaction at what appears to be her death compared to Nefaria's glee forcing her to recognize that Masque was right about the Avengers. Whitney joins the battle and plays a key role in her father's defeat, her weapon causing him to begin leaking ionic energy until he finally collapses. She renounces her criminal past, and [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-II]] of the Thunderbolts offers her membership, but she declines, departing to parts unknown to consider her future. Before leaving, she asked MACH-II to thank everyone for her, especially Iron Man.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>
