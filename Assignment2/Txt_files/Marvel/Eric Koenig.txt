==Fictional character biography==
'''Eric Koenig''' was a member of the original [[Howling Commandos]] and fought alongside the team during [[World War II]]. He was a pilot as well as a trainer and was a very anti-Nazi German, as the Nazis killed his sister. He was the replacement of [[Dino Manelli]], who was away on a special mission,{{Issue|date=September 2009}} and then replaced [[Izzy Cohen]] when he was a prisoner of war.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Upon Cohen's return, Koenig stayed as a member of the team.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} In issue #65, "Eric Koenig, Traitor!", Koenig seemed to have been exposed as a Gestapo plant, and his apparent treachery was part of the storyline from then on. This later turned out to have been a complicated double agent operation by the High Command, and in issue #79, Koenig was finally confirmed to be a loyal fighter for the Allies.<ref>''Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos'' #65. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos'' #79. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the war, Koenig was one of the Howlers that joined Nick Fury in forming [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{Issue|date=September 2009}} A [[Life Model Decoy]] of Koenig appeared and was part of the Deltite affair, but destroyed itself after being captured and scanned by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1-3.

When S.H.I.E.L.D. was decommissioned and its agents auto-transferred to the newly founded [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] during the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Eric remained with H.A.M.M.E.R. This was despite the fact that 1200 agents who were Fury loyalists (including Dum Dum Dugan and Gabriel Jones) resigned and formed the Howling Commandos PMC. It later transpired that he was working for them from within, and aided in a heist that saw the HCPMC (now owned by Fury) raid a number of H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarriers, and bolstering their ranks when over 3000 H.A.M.M.E.R. agents defected to their side.<ref>''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #4-6.
