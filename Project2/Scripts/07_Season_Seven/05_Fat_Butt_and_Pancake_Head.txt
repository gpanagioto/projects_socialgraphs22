Kyle : ''[wearing an argyle sweater]'' ...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. ''[cheers from the school crowd before him]''
Principal Victoria : ''[approaches the mic]'' Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.
Mr. Mackey : ''[as Kyle approaches him]'' That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. ''[a shot of the council, which is comprised of five Latinos. ]''
Kyle : Cool.
Principal Victoria : All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman. ''[reads again in disbelief]'' Eric Cartman? ''[a smattering of applause from the kids in the crowd]''
Cartman : ''[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back]'' Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
Kids : Jennifer Lopez?
Kyle : No way.
Cartman : ''[shows off his left hand, which is open]'' Miss Lopez, come on out here. ''[the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it]''
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : ''[Cartman begins to speak in a Spanish cartoon accent and his lips form a tiny smile as his hand begins to move]'' Hallooo. ''[the hand sports a small wig and a paper cutout of a woman's body hanging down from it. The cutout wears a white top and shorts and a heavy brown coat. The cutout's right hand sports some yellow bracelets]''
Principal Victoria : ''[taken aback]'' Oh, Jesus Christ.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos.
Cartman : Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : Oh si, si. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress.
Cartman : Oh, you mean this one? ''[whips out a doll's dress for the occasion]''
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : Oh si si si. I like it very much.

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : ''Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy.''
Cartman : And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. ''[Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation.

Kyle : No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!

Kyle : Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
Cartman : Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
Kyle : She's ''not'' eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : When ''you'' eat a taco it comes out ''your'' backside too, cholo!

Kyle : Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ''[Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman]'' "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"
Stan : Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make ''us'' look dumb?
Kyle : YES, dude! ''[they then walk back into the living room]''
Stan : Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten your''self'' into this mess, then we'll help you.
Cartman : Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : Oh no you don't!
Cartman : Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
Kyle : Out! ''[walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out]''
Cartman : Guys... Uh... Uh... ''[dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]''
+++++Outside, day. Cartman reaches the sidewalk when he sees something.+++++
Ben : There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! ''[Cartman decides to run in the other direction]'' Jenny? ''[Cartman sees a car pull up in front of him and then...]''
Aide 1 : Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! ''[Cartman decides to ran back towards Ben, but runs into a pair of female legs]''
Jennifer Lopez : ''[disheveled, wielding a running chainsaw over her head]'' So you're gettin' married, huh? ''[revs up the motor, and Cartman makes his escape, screaming. In the background, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny have stepped out the door to see what's going on.]''
Ben : Don't you hurt her!
BHI President : We'll sue you!
Kyle : Oh Jesus.
+++++A bridge over a wide river, day. Jennifer Lopez has followed Cartman here. Cartman screams. A police car pulls up from the other end of the bridge. The driver steps out, and both officers draw their guns at Jennifer Lopez, now unrecognizable.+++++
Police officer 1 : Freeze, leafblower! ''[she drops the chainsaw and holds her hands up]''
Aide 1 : Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! ''[the arrest is made]''
Police officer 2 : All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.
Ben : ''[rushes up to "Jennifer Lopez"]'' Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!
Aide 2 : Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! ''[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive]''
Ben : Our love is like rain!
Jennifer Lopez : That's what you said about me, asshole!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : Quiet!
BHI President : Get her out of here!
Jennifer Lopez : Fuck you!
Police officer 2 : Shut up, picante pants!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : Everyone be quiet! ''[Everyone stops what they're doing and look at the hand]'' I'm... I'm not who you think I am.
BHI President : You're not?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez : No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot continue anymore. I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am... ''[Cartman rips off the small wig he had on his hand and delivers a new voice]'' ...Mitch Conner. ''[everyone, including Kyle, gasps]''
Police officer 2 : Who's Mitch Conner?
Mitch Conner : Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'.
Kyle : ''[exasperated]'' Oh no, no, no.
Mitch Conner : I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time.
Kyle : Stop. It.
Mitch Conner : Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart. ''[Ben begins to sob. Cartman walks to one side of the bridge]'' But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down. I wonder, will I dream? ''[as the sun drops below the horizon, Cartman opens his hand and a gust of wind is heard. Whatever was possessing the hand parted. Ben sobs once more as Cartman just stares in wonder]''
Police officer 2 : Well, looks like Mitch Conner has cashed in his last chips. ''[everyone disperses except the boys. Ben stays on for a second, but he too leaves.]''
Kyle : ''[the boys step forward]'' Dude, who the hell is Mitch Conner?
Cartman : I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
Kyle : ''[resigns]'' All right. ''[Cartman beams]'' All right, I guess it's possible.
Cartman : ''[dances back to the other three boys]'' Hahahahahaaaha! ''[into Kyle's face]'' I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
+++++A fast-food Mexican Restaurant, La Taco. People are enjoying their food, one person is waiting for his order, and there are employees behind the counter. One of them looks familiar.+++++
