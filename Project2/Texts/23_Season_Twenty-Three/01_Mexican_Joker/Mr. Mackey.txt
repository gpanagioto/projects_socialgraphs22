 Oh hey, guys. Sorry, the front door was open, so I just walked on in. Seein' if I could still get those seeds from ya, Stephen? Oh, I was gonna try my hand at growin' some weed and Stephen said he'd give me some seeds to get started. Yeah, you know, I think I'll just grow my own weed. My own weed. I'll grow my own weed.
