I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen? Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.  God, I have to do everything around here! ''I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.]'' What the hell's going on?  What?! You're God-damn right I have a problem! ''Terrance and Phillip'' is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?! Fat camp? Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am ''sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!''  Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how ''everyone'' in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies! Well, I'm ''pissed off'', Rick! How are you?  No.  Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!  This... is... bullcrap!  I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.  Take it! I can't eat this crap!  Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass. Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again! Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  Boy, am I glad to see you! You're ''damn right'' you can! Two Roller Pops, please! Hunh?   Memememeee!  Is anyone starting to suspect anything? Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over! What?! Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.  Suck my balls, 20! Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that ''your'' parents think that ''you're'' in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're ''both'' screwed!    Why are you crying, Chad?  Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend. Yes.  ...There you go.   Eh- shut up, you half-Chad! You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight!  What?! Well, screw you, fatasses!
