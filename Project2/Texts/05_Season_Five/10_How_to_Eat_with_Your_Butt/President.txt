Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons. Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room.  That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.  Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center.  Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases. So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years? Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili.  And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years.  Come around here, Ben!  Isn't this wonderful?
