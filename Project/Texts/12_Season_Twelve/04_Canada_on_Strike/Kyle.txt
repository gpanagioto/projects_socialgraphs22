Guys, I'm really worried about my brother. You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass! There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike! Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike.  We totally think you should have more money. Huh? Well we don't really have that much money. The Internet? They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet. We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.   Hello? Wait we're working on it. Sir, we're doing everything we can. We don't want you to die. We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please? Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn. Okay, we did it. Here.  Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now. Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!  Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!  He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything! If they give you something small, will you end the strike? Can you act like you're giving him a lot? Ike. Ike!  It's over. Yeah. Here you go.  Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
