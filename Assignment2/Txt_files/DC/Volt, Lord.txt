'''Lady Quark''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the [[DC Universe]]. In the [[DC Comics]] 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985-1986), the character was one of the rulers of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#Catalogued|Earth-Six]], which was ruled by royalty. In 2011 introduction of [[The New 52]] [[DC Multiverse]], she and her husband Lord Volt are now the monarchs of Earth 48, which appears to be a modern analogue of Earth-Six in the original DC multiverse.

==Fictional character biography==
===''Crisis''===
Lady Quark comes from Earth-Six, where the [[American Revolutionary War]] was not won by the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and where technology has become more advanced than [[Earth-One]]. Lady Quark, her husband Karak ("Lord Volt"), and daughter Liana ("Princess Fern") make up the [[royal family]] that rules Earth-6. While Lord Volt and Princess Fern are both killed when Earth-Six is destroyed during the Crisis, Lady Quark is saved at the last minute by [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]], a dimensional traveler. Lady Quark helps most of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]]'s surviving heroes and they journey to the Dawn of Time to battle the [[Anti-Monitor]]. After the Crisis is over, Lady Quark resettles on Earth with Pariah and the [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]].<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #4</ref>

Missing her husband, Lady Quark approaches [[Starman (comics)#Will Payton|Will Payton]] with the idea of having him become her consort in ''Starman'' #8 (March 1989), but Payton rejects her advances.

===L.E.G.I.O.N.===
Lady Quark is eventually recruited by [[Vril Dox]] to become a member of the peace-keeping force [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '90'' #18. Lady Quark is apparently killed in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #62 after a parasitic shapeshifter absorbs her memories and powers. The shapeshifter replaces her in L.E.G.I.O.N., but later dies in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #70. Lady Quark's corpse is later seen floating in space, heavily maimed.

===Return===
Eleven years later, Lady Quark returns alive and well without explanation in ''[[Villains United]]'' #5 (2005), in which she is captured by [[Sinestro]] at the request of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] She is imprisoned in Luthor's tower as part of his plan to bring the core Earths of the Multiverse back into existence. Lady Quark is later freed and joins Earth's heroes in defeating Luthor in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005-2006).

Lady Quark appears again in several splash pages of ''Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime'' (December 2007), and again in a double page spread of Legionnaires and characters associated with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #5 (July 2009).

===''The New 52''===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' 2011 reboot of ''[[Vibe (comics)|Vibe]]'', Lady Quark is revealed to be one of [[Amanda Waller]]'s and [[A.R.G.U.S.|A.R.G.U.S]]'s interdimensional prisoners. Vibe releases Lady Quark, along with [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]], [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]], and several other formerly absent characters, and the former prisoners begin to attack Amanda Waller and A.R.G.U.S.<ref>''Vibe'' #6 (July 2013)</ref>

===Multiversity: Earth-48===
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Multiversity]]'' series, Lady Quark and her husband, Lord Volt, appear as residents of Earth 48 of ''[[The New 52]]'' 's modified [[DC Multiverse]]. According to subsequent information, this iteration of Earth-48 is a fusion of the Pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' Earth-Six and Warworld (''52'' 's Earth-48). Lady Quark, Lord Volt and their daughter Liana are members of Earth 48's royal family, much as they were on Earth-Six.<ref>''The Multiversity: Hall of Heroes'' (August 2014)</ref><ref>''Multiversity Guidebook'' (January 2015)</ref>

===Infinite Frontier===

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Quark is a [[metahuman]] with the ability to absorb and emit nuclear energies.  She can direct these energies as percussive forces from her body. Her powers allow her to fly and travel through space. If her unexplained reappearance is taken as is, it may be assumed she can regenerate herself even from seeming death.
