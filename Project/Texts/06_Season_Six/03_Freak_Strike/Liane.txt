Yes, sweetie? What's that, my little man? Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop. Of course I do. Sweetie, don't. I'm glad you're not like that, poopsie-kins. Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle. Oh, he's such a cutie. Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear. Oh, I mean, sex and drugs.
