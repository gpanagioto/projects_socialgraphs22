Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle? Kyle! Go get the door, Kyle! ...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...''special'' thing. No, no, you're ''very'' special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids.  Kyle, eh, the problem is... Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts! You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout. Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there.  And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid." Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it. Ike, you behave! Oh my God, what is that?!  This retreat really ''is'' out of the way, isn't it? I'm sure they are. Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny? Try and act Jewish.
