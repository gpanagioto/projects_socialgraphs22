Exactly what kind of trouble is Shelly in, Mr. Mackey? Her butthole??  Why would the recess monitor want a picture of my daughter's butthole?! Jesus Christ, how much worse can things get around here?! Seriously?! Dog's butthole?! That's what we're doin' now, huh?! There's not enough bad things in the world, we get called into school, "Here's a dog's butthole for ya." That's what it's all come to, Shelly?!  I am seriously over it. Don't you just wanna start over? Go back to simpler times? I've had it. School shootings, pieces of shit taking Ambien and tweeting, priests raping kids, and somehow... I'm not laughing anymore. Let's do it, Sharon. What I've always talked about. Let's get out of here. Go buy a farm and live off the land. Never been more serious.  Let's move out to the country. Go back to simple living when things mattered, like hard work and 'tegridy. By growing things and, and selling what we make with our hands. We can do this, Sharon. It's time. Mornin' Joe? How's the farmin'? Well that's fine, Joe, just fine. I'm growin' some Green Willy Stranger myself. And the Catatonic Tegridy Bud is takin' well.  So long, Joe!   Name is right there on the sign. Come on back! Now, what about the Tegridy Jungle Bud? Yeah? Yeeahh?!  All right!  Howdy. What can I do ya for? Yeah, name's right there on the sign. Really? Hey, that'd be great. What kind of company-   Oh no, sorry. I don't want my Tegridy Bud put in those pussy sticks. Yeah, you know. Penis pens, wussy vape, lady joints. Not on my farm, no sirree. That's nice. Now how's about you take that pussy stick and get off my farm before I shove it up your ass and you're blowin' mist out your butthole?  Yeah, whatever. All you're doin' is blowin' smoke -- Sorry, "fruity steam." Pussy. Go vape some more, ya fuckin' puss! Whatcha doin', Joe? Just like that, huh? You gonna let those people with pussy sticks take over everythin'?! Oh. I hope you didn't pack your tegridy, 'cause clearly, Are you still here?! Agh!  Isn't this great, Stan? Livin' off the land?  Well you see that? We're talkin' now.  When was the last time we really talked like this? Ithink we're havin' a breakthrough moment. I want to give you somethin', son. Somethin' I made that I want you to have.  It's a hemp hat. Come on, let's just see how it fits. Here, just-just look. Just try it.  Whoa. Bless us, Lord, and our little cannabis farm, and may we always keep our tegridy. Amen.  So, how was everyone's day?  With a WHAT?! Stan had a vape pen?!   Where did you get this?! Yeah, right! My own son using a pussy stick!  Don't you know what these things are doin' to our way of life?! I've had enough! You think I'm just gonna stand around while they destroy my family?! We've worked this farm and this land for over four days! I'm not about to let some vape queens take it all away from us!   All right, you bunch of vape-smoking' pussies! You try and take my way of life?! Time to show you some tegridy!   Get your stupid mist out of my fucking face! Yup!   I don't think so! Just what the Sam Hell you boys doin' here?! It's good you came clean, son. It shows that you've got-  Yeah. She taught me somethin' else too! If you're gonna fight for your tegridy, don't forget to bring a towel. Yeah!   Well, shit. Looks like we made it to another sunrise. Yup son. I think the fight's just startin'. Farmers like us are under attack.
