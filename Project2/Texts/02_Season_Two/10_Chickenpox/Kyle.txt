Are you guys having a meeting or something? Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here. I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad. Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo. Well, here's Kenny's house. Heheheh, buns. Oh my God. This is like a third-world country. I don't know. Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with. Cartman, what the hell is that? ''No'', it's not cool! Yeah. I feel great! Yeah, dude. I ''told'' you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast. Yes. Why? No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable! Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him. Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young? Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food? But ''why?'' If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of ''our'' food? Gods and clods? Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods! Could we go home now, Ma? But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do. What's "ookie mouth"? Sick, dude! Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma! Argh! I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. What the hell does that have to do with American history? Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes. What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me? "So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."  What?  Oh my God!  You! You! You sent us over to Kenny's house on ''purpose!'' You ''wanted'' us to get sick! Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?! You get away from me, you crazy woman!  Stan! Stan!  Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox? Dude! Our parents sent us over there to ''get'' us sick! They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway. Yeah. And I think I figured out why. Because they're a bunch of assholes. Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago? Yeah, dude. Your mom ''wanted'' you to have herpes on your face. No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em ''all'' back. Chef, we wanna know about herpes. Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust. Do you know anybody with herpes? Cool! Thanks, Chef! Are you old Frida? Someone who wants a favor.  Huh? Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital. D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're ''all'' gonna get herpes! Aw, man.  I don't feel so good. Ugh... We're sorry. This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman. I'm better now. We gave you guys herpes. You bastards!
