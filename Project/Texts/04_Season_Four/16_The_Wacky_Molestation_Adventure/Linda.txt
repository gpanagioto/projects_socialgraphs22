 What do you want from us?? Mark, I don't like this.  What is it?! Acid?! Oh God! Are you blind?! Mark? Mark, look.  What- what do you want?  Mark, I'm scared! Oh God, Mark! Help!  You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?! Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright? Mark, are we doing the right thing? I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.  Hey, I think you'd make a great father. My God! Mark!  What is it?? The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here. Na-a-ah!  Mark! Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone? But what about before that? Yes!! Mark, I'm scared.  Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place.   Uh, uh... Mmrrhhhh! Rrrmm-mmrrhh! Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word. Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all. Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow!   Hey, kids. And I got my tubes tied.
