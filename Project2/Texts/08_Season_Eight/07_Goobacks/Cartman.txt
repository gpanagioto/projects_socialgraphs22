 Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars? Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am! It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  What? Dude, I'm takin' a break. Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers. It works, doesn't it? Did I ''not'' just get us an extra five bucks? Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass! Shoveling accident. You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it. What?! Who?! We can't understand you, asshole!  Look, it's working!  Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
