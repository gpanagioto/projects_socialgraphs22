 Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?  How about I put on the uniform? Huh? What do you think? You know you like it. UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you. If you'll just...  Yeah?  Huh?  And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark! What?  What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo!  Yes, that's mine. Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs.
