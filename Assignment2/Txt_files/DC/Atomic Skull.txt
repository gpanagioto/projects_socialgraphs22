==Fictional character biography==
===Albert Michaels===
Albert Michaels was a brilliant, but genuinely unfriendly scientist-administrator at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] with a rare nervous system disorder that short-circuited the electrical impulses in his brain, creating painful and uncontrollable [[seizures]]. When he could not find a cure, he secretly contacted the criminal organization [[List_of_criminal_organizations_in_DC_Comics#S|SKULL]], and they implanted him with a [[radium]]-powered device designed to harness his neural disorder into deadly atomic "brain-blasts" in exchange for him becoming their agent.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=11}}</ref> However, these mental blasts were difficult to control and only made his condition worse, a situation that he blamed on [[Superman]] after the Man of Steel captured the only SKULL scientists who could have cured him. Swearing revenge, the evil genius donned his distinctive yellow and green costume with its visored, cowl-topped skull mask, called himself the Atomic Skull, and eventually became the organization's leader, flying around in a sleek skull-shaped [[hovercraft]] of his own design and assisted by his similarly costumed lover Felicia, who was a [[Panthera|panther]] that he had [[The Island of Doctor Moreau|artificially evolved into human form]].

Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Michaels made one appearance, battling [[Thunder and Lightning (comics)|Thunder and Lightning]] in ''[[Teen Titans|Teen Titans Spotlight]]''. It is assumed that his background has not changed, although instead of being diagnosed with a nervous disorder, it was said that his powers came because he sought immortality and presumably mutated himself. It is not known if he ever fought the Post-''Crisis'' version of Superman before, as his first (Post-''Crisis'') appearance was in ''[[Captain Atom]]'', yet his history with S.T.A.R. Labs and SKULL remained as established in ''The DC Comics Encyclopedia''.

Michaels returned in 2007 in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #110</ref> He also appeared in the miniseries ''[[Villains United]]'', where he joined Luthor's Society.<ref>''Villains United'' #5</ref>

===Joseph Martin===

Student Joseph Martin was at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] for a routine check-up when it was struck by an intense blast of energy from the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]]' gene-bomb that gave him superhuman strength and caused his flesh to become invisible. Later attacked by some thugs, the resulting brain damage caused insanity, and he took on the guise of "the Atomic Skull" who was a hero from an old [[movie serial]] that he loved. He also emitted dangerous amounts of radiation, later gaining the ability to project it as energy blasts. He has plagued [[Superman]], whom he believed to be the serial's villain Doctor Electron (particularly when Superman had currently acquired electricity-based powers), and [[Lois Lane]], whom he saw as the Skull's love interest, Zelda Wentworth.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger  | first = Robert | contribution = Atomic Skull | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 31  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>

He was later given enhanced powers by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for his soul.<ref>''Underworld Unleashed'' #1</ref> Cured of his delusions, he at first intended to follow the character's example for real as a superhero, but has since appeared as a more conventional supervillain.

He is killed in battle by the [[Maximums]],<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #21</ref> an alternate reality superhero team, but is later seen alive in the pages of ''Action Comics'',<ref>''Action Comics'' #853</ref> assuming that [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]] reversed his death, along with other events having to do with the Maximums.

Recently, Martin crashed a movie premiere in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], having become obsessed with an actress who was in the film. He was defeated by [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Manhunter]].<ref>''Manhunter'' vol. 2 #31</ref>

Martin was among the villains in the ambush of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] led by the Tapeworm.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #29</ref>

While Superman is [[World of New Krypton|off-world]], Martin attempts to cause trouble in downtown Metropolis, but is defeated by [[Mon-El]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 2 #41</ref>

====''The New 52''====
In ''[[The New 52]]'' reboot launched in 2011, the Joseph Martin version of the Atomic Skull is re-introduced in ''Action Comics'' vol. 2 Annual #1, penned by ''[[Chronicle (film)|Chronicle]]'' writer [[Max Landis]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Tony Guerrero |url=http://www.comicvine.com/news/interview-chronicle-writer-max-landis-talks-superman-atomic-skull-and-his-passion-for-comics/145429/ |title=Interview: 'Chronicle' Writer Max Landis Talks Superman, Atomic Skull and His Passion for Comics |publisher=Comic Vine |date=2012-10-25 |access-date=2016-09-23}}</ref>

When a S.T.A.R. Labs submarine crashes far below the surface of the ocean, one of its scientists is exposed to experimental radiation. He is washed to shore, with memories of the life he had, and the woman he loved and lost. Alone on a desert island, he fights to survive, eating the local, tropical vegetation. When a leopard finds and attacks him, he unexpectedly emits a blast of radiation that vaporizes the big cat's body. Eventually, he learns to use this power to his benefit, killing animals for food, and blasting away holes in the rock faces for shelter. The radiation soon takes its toll on him, as he remembers how he had caught his wife flirting with someone at a dance club and murdered her in a jealous rage. In anger, he destroys most of the island. His face, meanwhile, practically melts away, revealing his radioactive skull.<ref>''Action Comics'' vol. 2 Annual #1</ref><ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=22}}</ref>

====''DC Rebirth''====
In June 2016, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic book titles with ''[[DC Rebirth]]''. The Atomic Skull is seen imprisoned in Kamen Maximum Security Prison in ''Superwoman'' #1.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #4</ref>

In ''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #45, the Atomic Skull is shown trying to make amends by being the warden at [[Stryker's Island|Stryker's Island Penitentiary]]. When [[Hal Jordan]] tried to break out [[Hector Hammond]], the Atomic Skull fought him, but before he could do anything else, Hector Hammond renders him temporarily brain dead using his psychic powers and Hal Jordan convinces him to let the Atomic Skull live.<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #45</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Albert Michaels can deliver powerful energy bolts through the visor of his mask. The energy blasts have been described as powerful brain waves, heat vision and atomic blasts throughout the years. Aside from his energy attacks, Michaels is also the head of the SKULL organization and a brilliant scientist.

Joseph Martin has superhuman strength, agility and endurance, comparable to that of Superboy (Conner Kent), Superman, and Mon-El. He can also produce purple atomic blasts from his hands and mouth for long range attacks and use the same energy to power up his already impressive physical strength to a higher degree.

==Other versions==
===Movie serial===
The Atomic Skull is the name of Joseph Martin's favorite hero from a (fictional) 12-episode movie serial made by National Film Studios in 1936. The serial stars Lawrence Dennis (according to ''Superman Villains [[Secret Files and Origins]]'' #1) as the titular character. This Atomic Skull was originally government agent Joe Martin who investigated the evil Doctor Electron and was transformed into the hideous Atomic Skull by one of Electron's inventions. Despite this, he and Zelda Wentworth, Electron's daughter (played by actress Eleanor Hart, whom [[Lois Lane]] has a passing resemblance to<ref>''Superman: The Essential Guide to the Man of Steel'', p. 100</ref>), fell in love. Battling Electron and his minions (such as Rocketman) with his heat ray eye-blasts, the Atomic Skull eventually destroyed the mad scientist's plans and returned to normal. The [[fictional character]] from the serial is visually identical to Albert Michaels, the Pre-''Crisis'' version of the Atomic Skull.

===Dominus' reality===
In a story featuring the reality-altering villain [[Dominus (DC Comics)|Dominus]] recreating various Pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' Superman continuities, the supposed [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Atomic Skull was first introduced. He was '''Lawrence Dennis''', an actor and [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizer who used his reputation as the hero of the serial ''Curse of the Atomic Skull'' as a platform to promote [[Nazism]].

===''Superman: Red Son''===
The Atomic Skull is featured in the alternate reality ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' as one of [[Lex Luthor]]'s experiments.<ref>''Superman: Red Son'' #3</ref>

===''Flashpoint''===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, a version of the Atomic Skull is imprisoned in the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|military Doom prison]] and is working to keep the other prisoners in, as he recognizes that he is a bigger fish in jail than he would ever be in the real world.<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>

He is soon confronted by the combined forces of [[Superman]] and The [[The Elite (DC Comics)|Elite]], who manage to defeat the Atomic Skull through [[Coldcast]] absorbing the Atomic Skull's radiation, but with massive collateral damage. At this point, The Elite's leader [[Manchester Black]] plans to execute the Atomic Skull himself, leaving the decision up to the son of a professor who was killed by the Atomic Skull and a vehement Superman supporter. The boy votes for the Atomic Skull's death and Manchester Black executes the Atomic Skull to the cheer of the watching crowd and the horror of Superman.
