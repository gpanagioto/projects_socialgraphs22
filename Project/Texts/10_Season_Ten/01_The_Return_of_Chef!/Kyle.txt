Going away? For how long? Draw two card, fatass. Yeah! Chef! I can't believe you're back! Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef. Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring. Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles!  Like what? Weirdo.  Good. ...Chef?? A-are you ok? This doesn't make any sense! Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!  Chef, the police are asking questions about you! Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?! He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things. Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex. All right, come on guys! Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something? Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids.  Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff! ...Dude! Dude, what are you doing? Just what the hell is that thing?! HA! I knew it! The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this - fruity little club! All right, come on.  Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club. But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever! No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend. Come on, Chef! You can do it! ...Do you realize how retarded that sounds? We're not going anywhere without Chef. No! Hey! Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend! Chef, come on! Here!  Get outside!  Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef? No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??  You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!! We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains. And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all.
