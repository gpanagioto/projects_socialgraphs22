Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you? And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains. Well, I'm ''trying'' to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head. ...So? Because it's Christmas??? Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you? Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus? The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go? See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan. Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark? You ''are'' the Jewish community! Can we get rid of all the Mexicans? Rats! Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too? Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus. So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs. Yes, Eric? What the...  Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric? Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any ''Christmas'' lights, since they offend people with epilepsy... ...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?  Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.  Okay. Now let's practice our... Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on? Oh brother. Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage? And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there. Okay, kids, get ready to take your places. ''You're'' the ones who made it this way!
