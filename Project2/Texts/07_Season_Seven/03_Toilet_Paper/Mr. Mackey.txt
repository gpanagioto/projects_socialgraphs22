We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please? Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k?  Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know- It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything. You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave. Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?
