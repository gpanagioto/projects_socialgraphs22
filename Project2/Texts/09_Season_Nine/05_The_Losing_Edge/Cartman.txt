 We're done! No more baseball! All right, we did it!  Post-season? Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals! All right, hit one out of the park!  Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it. All right!  Ball. Balll.  That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery! What?!  How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first! What happens if we win the State Championship game? Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team. Exactly right, Clyde. So what ''we'' need... is to find somebody to join ''our'' team, who totally sucks ass. I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!  We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
