==Fictional character biography==
Debra Whitman was a secretary in the biophysics department of Empire State University. While there, she met Peter and they started dating. However, things kept coming up in his secret life as Spider-Man and he kept giving her excuses to get out of the date. Because of Peter's rejections, she started to date Biff Rifkin for emotional support, but her infatuation with Peter did nothing but grow.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #66</ref>

Debra also suffered from a mental instability that led her to idealize people and invert values. With Peter it grew further into her hallucinating that he was Spider-Man. When she told her psychiatrist, Dr. Baily Kuklin, about her hallucinations, he asked Peter to wear the Spider-Man suit to give her a shocking confrontation with reality to get her out of the hallucination. Peter refused, and indicated Biff Rifkin as a more reliable source of information. However, Biff already knew Debra when she was married to Mark Whitman. One day he asked her about her black eye and she gave evasive answers. That night he went to their house and saw Mark beating her. He rescued her and took her to the hospital, but she insisted Mark was a kind and gentle husband, locked in denial.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #74</ref> Peter then wore the suit and told her he was Spider-Man. The shock made her come to her senses and decided to leave New York to get a divorce.<ref name=autogenerated1 />
During the superhero "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", Peter reveals his identity as Spider-Man to the world.<ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref>  Thereafter, Debra is seen on the phone speaking to her co-writer about her new book, entitled "TWO FACED: How Spider-Man Ruined My Life".  She seems discouraged about the title and tone of the book, but is committed to a book signing later in the day. Enraged, she then hurls items around the room to get out her anger before the signing.  At the book signing, Spider-Man and the newly released [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] are both seen planning to crash.<ref name=autogenerated2>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #14-17</ref>

After Spider-Man defeats the Vulture, Debra reveals to [[Betty Brant]] the editors had forced her to exaggerate the mental damage that Peter had "done" to her in order to make for a better book. Debra's mother had been sick and the medical bills were far more than she could pay for, so when the [[Daily Bugle]] dug up all of Peter Parker's past relationships to get dirt on him, she jumped on the chance to write the book. Betty talked Debra into telling the truth to the Daily Globe, confidentially.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

In order to save the life of [[Aunt May|May Parker]] (who was near death with no prospect of recovery), Peter and his wife [[Mary Jane Watson]] agree to allow the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to alter history. In the new timeline, Peter and Mary Jane were never married, and his identity as Spider-Man was forgotten.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545</ref> Consequently, Debra's knowledge of Peter's identity (beyond her suspicions while the two were dating) is erased from history as well.

* Debra Whitman appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by Liz Georges. This version of the character is portrayed as a scientific genius and a love interest for [[Flash Thompson]], while sharing a friendly rivalry with Peter Parker. She also showed interest in [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] prior to Flash. Debra plays a minor supporting role in the series, with one episode seeing her temporarily fall victim to the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and another seeing her being rejected by Morbius and developing a crush on Flash. After learning Morbius became a pseudo-[[vampire]], Debra attempted to make a cure for him, but her failure led to her becoming a party girl until Flash stepped in and reminded her of who she really is. She eventually returned to her original lifestyle and maintained her relationship with Flash.
* Debra Whitman appeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', in a non-speaking role. This version is depicted as [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]]'s African-American secretary. She is older than her comic book counterpart and therefore has no romantic interest in Peter. The show's original depiction of [[Gwen Stacy]] as a nerdy girl wearing glasses was also inspired by Debra in the comics.<!--PLEASE REMOVE ONCE A PROPER WIKIPEDIA-APPROVED SOURCE HAS BEEN BEEN FOUND FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION

===Film===
* Although she does not actually appear, a character named '''Missy Kallenback''' appears in the 2012 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', who seems to be partially inspired by Debra. She is portrayed as a nerdy girl in Peter's class that he is friendly towards, even defending her when Flash Thompson picks on her in gym class.-->
