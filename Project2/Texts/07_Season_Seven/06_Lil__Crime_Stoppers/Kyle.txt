Awww, shit! Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a great idea. Really? Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am. I think we can piece this case together now. Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory. Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet. Then saw off the arms and legs.  But before he could go through with his entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  We're in business! Do you know where your doll is? All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!  But the window isn't locked. Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it. Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty! Yeah, but how? How... ''do'' you make semen come out? Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast. What?  What??  What do we do now? Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people. We've got to do something. ...Grrrr!!!  But they said we can't charge the front door. We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, ass-face!  Ah... a a a meth lab? What is a meth lab, anyway? Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it.  We're sorry. Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore. Better how, dude? We were ''happy'' playing Laundromat Owners. Uh we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison. Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was- No.  Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble. Uh, it's okay. We know the owner. Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat. Certainly. That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
