Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone. But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-   My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya? What?!   I know that, okay?!   Gerald. Please help us. Our house... It has no Internet.  We've got nothing! It's just gone.   Oh no you're not!  What?!  It's not working, Gerald. Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it! Right, Starbucks! No! Nobody's is! Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now. God, the whole neighborhood's affected.  Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store. How do you know?! Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!  Jesus, it's statewide. Jesus... we're all alone...  I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't.   Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop! You're right. We can't just sit here any longer. We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way. Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up! Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go. How. You won't have Internet.  Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet. Sure will be nice.  That's right. We need to get online. Come on, Stan, let's get some rest.  Everyone, wake up!  Do they have Internet here? Marsh. NetZero. So is there Internet here? Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet. Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia! Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way?  Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.  Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.  I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy! Three minutes would be plenty.  Ohhh. Yeah, how'd you know? I know, right? "Internet Porn Simulator"  Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  It's just not the same.  Well at least that part's like the Internet. Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Oh niice... Whoa...   Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!   It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me! Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost!  And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT
