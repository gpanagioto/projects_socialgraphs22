Hello, Mayor,... everybody. What are you doing here? For what? Guys, my season is over. Tegridy Farms' season ended weeks ago. ...You want me to do a... Christmas special? But guys, look behind you.  The crops are dead. How am I supposed to sell weed to people now? Tegridy. Well, you're right about that. Let me call my marijuana science specialist and.... I'll see what I can do. So we use the greenhouse. There's gotta be a way to make a Christmas special. It's what everyone wants. That's 'cause people really didn't like Mexican Joker. I'm not gonna just repackage it. That's not special. Nagh.  Well howdy there, folks. Heard you were all a little down and might need a boost.  Just a little somethin' extra for a special kick. Oh, hi Mayor. What's going on? Are people not liking the Christmas special so far? Okay, okay, look, you busted us. It's a mix of different strains of marijuana we had left over from last season. I know, it's wrong... Oh that? That's cocaine. Yeah, I got the idea praying to Christ. You know, powder, snow, it's what gives Christmas Snow its kick.  Getting enough cocaine was the tricky part, so we started growing our own. Turns out the coca plant is even hardier than the marijuana plant. It can grow even when we're out of season. It is??  Hey hey, it's not a big deal. I've been through this before.  Hang on, I'll handle it. Don't go anywhere. Legalize it! Legalize it! Okay, cocaine's totally legal now. Yeah, legal in seven states including this one, and other states are soon to follow. I told you. It's 2019, dawg. Our Christmas special is so amazing, I don't know how we're gonna keep up with all the demand. We need more help. We're never gonna get enough done in time. Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley, can you help us make more labels for our Christmas special? Oh great. My daughter had a marijuana problem and now she has a problem with cocaine.  What the hell is this? Heheey, fuck you. Who has that kind of power? We can't sell marijuana during the holidays.  We can't give up on the Christmas special. People need it. I think I know a way around this. There you are, ma'am. There you are, sir. This is amazing, Towelie. Tegridy Farms is finally gonna make all the money I ever dreamed of.  O-ho!  Ohhhhh! Hey Santa. We need to talk. Santa, you don't understand. Santa, that's not just cocaine. It's Tegridy cocaine. That's not true! This cocaine is grown locally. By local people. Please, just try it! Please!  Right?  Please, Jesus. It's Tegridy. Hey guys, I'm so happy my Christmas Special turned out okay.
