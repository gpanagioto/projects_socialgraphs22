I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra- But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom! You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here! Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean? It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please! Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on. Okay. Okay, bye, honey.  That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude! She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore! That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship! Oh hey babe, what's going on?  Nothin', just tellin' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan. Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome.  Heidi!  Oh my God, you're not gonna believe this. You were so right  Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat? Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat. So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC. It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it. I know, right?! Isn't that crazy?!  I don't know about you, but I could eat this every day.  Delicious.  Well uh, we've been trying some different foods lately and uh,  Heidi's put on some pounds, you guys. Yeah, Tolkien. Don't start rippin' on me for havin' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it.  Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What's goin' on?  Pick you up? That could be tough.  Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse's office.  Oh sure.  Sure, Kyle. What's up?  Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There's always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it's all part of trying to make each other better.  BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi's comin' through. I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite. You betcha, can't wait.  BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!  Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei-  Hei-, Hei-, Hei- Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Tolkien. I have nothing now, Tolkien. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please? I know how you feel now, Tolkien. To be pissed off at the world. To feel completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff.  Tolkien, pleeease! I'm sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys feel! Please, what time is your family gonna go disrespect the flag and stuff? I wanna go with! Heidi broke up with meeeeee.  Thank youuuu. So... You guys about done with the soup? Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff? Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it? Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt! No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls. Yeah...  What?  Kyle... KYLE!  I should have known. You lying snake! Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?! Shut up, Kyle! You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you and me!  You took everything from me! All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!  Fuck you, Kyle! What are you doing here?  That's good to know, 'cause like, nothing helps more when you're down than knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care. No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault. No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did.
