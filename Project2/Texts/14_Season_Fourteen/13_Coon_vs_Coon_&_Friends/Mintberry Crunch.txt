Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mintberry Crunch!  That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch! Rrright! The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch! Nono. Mintberry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants! Is he? Oh Jesus!  A what? A double rainbow? Shablagoo!  Waaaaaaaaaah!  And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mintberry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him! Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mintberry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists! Mintberry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion!  Hey Mysterion, wait up!  Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going? What? But he'll kill you. Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.  Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you.  Mysterion, no! What are you doing?! ...Uh yes. Yes, please go on. Wow! I will, father. No more running away for... Mintberry Crunch!  I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister.  Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis. Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents. I will. Shaaablagoo!
