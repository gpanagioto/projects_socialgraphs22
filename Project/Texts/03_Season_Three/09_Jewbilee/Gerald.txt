I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts! You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout. Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?  Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout. Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle. Yeah, lie. Hey, it's a bear!  Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back. We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
