 Hey, Jimmy. What's up? Oh. Really?  Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out. What? This is stupid! It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it! Who makes this crap? You... missed school today? Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day? You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium? Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game? Kenny, who told you about this game? Dude, what?! Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?  Dude, what are you doing?! You need to stop recommending that app to people!  Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?! You just push it on other people?! Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?! But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?! You ''have'' your crutches! You're saying these games do this on purpose?! Sure. Come on, guys.   We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then- Wuh, what's done? Hey dude. Y-you alright?
