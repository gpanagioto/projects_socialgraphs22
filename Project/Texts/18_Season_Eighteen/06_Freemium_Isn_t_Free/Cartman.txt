 What are you two boners doing? I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks. How much money did you micropay today, Stan? Yes. Jimmy told ''me'' about this game. The?! Everyone we know says they heard about it from you! It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!  And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?! That makes sense. It's done.  The word is out.  It's trending. Cool.
