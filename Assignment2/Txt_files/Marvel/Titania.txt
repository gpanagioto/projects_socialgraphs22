'''Titania''' ('''Mary MacPherran''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by then-Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]] and introduced in the 1984 crossover limited series ''[[Secret Wars]],'' Titania has since then become a rival of [[She-Hulk]], and has also been a member of several incarnations of the [[Masters of Evil]] and the [[Frightful Four]]. Originally a [[supervillain]], in later years, she has reformed into more of an [[antihero]]. Since her debut, Titania has been described as one of Marvel's strongest supervillains and been called one of She-Hulk's greatest foes.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-08-18 |title=Jameela Jamil's 'She-Hulk' Villain Just Made a Grand Entrance |url=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a40931561/jameela-jamila-titania-she-hulk/ |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=Men's Health |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Rabiroff |first=Zach |date=2022-08-18 |title=She-Hulk’s top rival is her most toxic fan |url=https://www.polygon.com/23308279/she-hulk-titania-explainer-comic-marvel-tv |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=Polygon |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Avina |first=Anthony |date=2019-09-09 |title=10 Villains Fans Hope To See In Marvel’s She-Hulk Series |url=https://www.cbr.com/she-hulk-marvel-comic-villains-disney-plus-series/ |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> 

MacPherran is the second Marvel supervillainess to use the name. The first [[Lascivious (comics)|Titania]] (Davida DaVito) was a female wrestler and member of [[Grapplers (comics)|The Grapplers]] who was murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''Captain America'' #319, July 1986</ref> Upon DaVito's resurrection, her powers were expanded and she took the name Lascivious, as MacPherran had become much more strongly identified with the name Titania.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7 #5, July 2009</ref>

Titania made her live action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] [[Disney+]] series ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'' (2022), portrayed by actress [[Jameela Jamil]].<ref name="Jamil">{{Cite web |last=Otterson |first=Joe |date=June 10, 2021 |title='She-Hulk' Series at Disney Plus Casts Jameela Jamil |url=https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/she-hulk-series-disney-plus-jameela-jamil-1234993894/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210610211614/https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/she-hulk-series-disney-plus-jameela-jamil-1234993894/ |archive-date=June 10, 2021 |access-date=June 10, 2021 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Titania was introduced in ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #3 (July 1984), and has appeared in many Marvel comics since then.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=382}}</ref>

Mary MacPherran is the name of a real-life Marvel production assistant who was asked by Jim Shooter if it was permissible to name a character after her. In 2011, Shooter posted a photo on his blog of a group of Marvel staffers, with a caption identifying the real MacPherran.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/12/man-who-flew-35-kamikaze-missions.html| first= Jim | last= Shooter  |  title= The Man Who Flew 35 Kamikaze Missions | website= jimshooter.com |date= December 7, 2011| access-date= April 19, 2019}}</ref> In a comment, Shooter said of MacPherran:

{{Blockquote|text=Wonderful, gentle, sweet Mary Mac was indeed a smidgen of the basis for Titania, who was a willowy young woman who became uber-robust and Hulk-level strong. If MM minded that I had a tough bad-girl inspired by her, and made the nod in her direction, she never mentioned it. And wicked-smart Volcana had a bit of Mary Jo Duffy at her core. It was a thing we did back when. Now, I suppose the creators would be sued.|author= Jim Shooter<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/12/man-who-flew-35-kamikaze-missions.html?showComment=1323412213369#c1410412538877743077 |title=Blog comment about the real Mary MacPherran| first= Jim | last= Shooter | website= jimshooter.com |date= December 9, 2011| access-date= April 19, 2019}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
Born prematurely in a suburb of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], '''Mary MacPherran''' grew up scrawny and short-statured, inspiring the popular Vanessa Ashwood at school to nickname her "Skeeter" (a slang word for mosquito). While a high school senior, Mary works as a salesclerk alongside her only friend, [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Marsha Rosenberg]], to support her struggling family. Consistently bullied since childhood by the wealthy and cruel Vanessa and her friends, Mary grows resentful and fantasizes about gaining superpowers to become admired, and exact retribution on her tormentors.

After the second [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]] (Julia Carpenter) makes one of her early appearances in their town, Marsha remarks that the new superheroine's reddish-blonde hair color matches Mary's. Mary then falsely confides to her friend that she is secretly Spider-Woman.  Shortly afterward, Mary is invited to a fancy party at Vanessa's house where she realizes that her newfound popularity is due to Marsha spreading the false Spider-Woman rumor.

In the middle of the party, their section of Denver is torn from [[Earth]] and becomes part of the composite planet [[Battleworld]], created by the [[Beyonder]] as a stage for a selected group of superheroes and supervillains to battle each other.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1 (1984)</ref> When the real Spider-Woman arrives on the scene to save the guests from a collapsing structure, the now-enraged Vanessa and her guests turn on Mary and Marsha, chasing them into the forests of Battleworld.<ref name="She-Hulk vol. 1 #10 2004">''She-Hulk'' (vol. 1) #10 (2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Scared and exhausted, the two girls are found by [[Doctor Doom]] in need of further metahuman operatives to further his ambitions.  Mary and Marsha both agree to Doom's offer of power in exchange for serving in his army of supervillains.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Secret Wars''===
Using the highly advanced alien technologies found in Doombase, the villain headquarters, powered by immense energies from the ferocious alien storm outside, Doom recreates both girls by inducing high-level metahuman abilities of specific and particular design.  While Rosenberg (now known as '''[[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]]''') receives a fiery form composed of ionized plasma, MacPherran gains powers diametrically opposed to her previous self&nbsp;– where once she had been "the scrawny one who got her face rubbed in the dirt", she becomes taller, more muscular, and buxom.

Titania's physical changes come with changes in personality. Where Mary MacPherran had been small and timid, the newly named Titania (seemingly as strong as a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]) is brash and confident. When Volcana melts machinery into a large pile of red-hot [[slag]], Titania picks it up, boldly ignoring the possibility of injury and hurls it through the wall. Soon after, she challenges Carl "Crusher" Creel, the [[Absorbing Man]], to a fight which he refuses, stating that he has "nothing to prove... to a dame." Titania begins to work for Doom in earnest, and is one of the villains ordered by Doom to attack the superheroes.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> She battles [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> as well as the [[X-Men]]. She eventually gets the better of [[She-Hulk]] beginning a long rivalry between the two.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the heroes later storm Doombase to rescue She-Hulk, Titania tries to face up against veteran superhero [[Spider-Man]]. Initially extremely confident due to her massive strength and durability, she panics upon realizing that Spider-Man's vastly superior speed, agility, reflexes, intelligence and years of experience against more powerful foes allow him to not only easily avoid her, but also attack her with complete impunity. The fight ends when Spider-Man beats her into the ground, then picks her up and disdainfully tosses her through an exterior wall.  During this fight, Titania's newfound arrogance quickly evaporates, giving way to what Spider-Man mockingly calls the "whining little wimp-ette"&nbsp;— it is clear that her arrogance masks an insecure, fragile personality.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mindful of this beating, Titania avoids coming into contact with Spider-Man while on Battleworld,<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #11 (1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> and harbors a fear of him for some time after returning to Earth.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man 1986">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 1) #283 (1986).

After her run-in with Spider-Man, the Absorbing Man and Titania begin a relationship. Once Owen Reece, the [[Molecule Man]], manages to seal off the chunk of Denver and navigate it toward Earth, Creel and MacPherran reveal that they are done with Doom and his war and simply want to go home.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #11-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the return to Earth, Titania beats up Vanessa Ashwood and destroys her house, but gets no satisfaction out of getting revenge on her childhood tormentor.<ref name="She-Hulk vol. 1 #10 2004"/>

===Back to Earth===
Once back on Earth, Titania and Absorbing Man continue to work as professional criminals by joining [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s latest incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers'' #273. Marvel Comics.</ref> Their first assignment is to recruit the powerful [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], which also prevents them from joining the main group in the assault on [[Avengers Mansion]]. To kill time, Titania robs a jewelry store and attracts the attention of Spider-Man. Too afraid to fight him, she runs but encounters him again at [[LaGuardia Airport]]. Titania avoids fighting, having Creel do so on her behalf. The sight of his near-defeat at Spider-Man's hands proves enough for Titania to temporarily overcome her 'arachnophobia', charging in to save her boyfriend. Creel ends the fight by threatening to destroy a plane full of innocents if Spider-Man refuses to leave the scene, which he reluctantly does.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man 1986"/>

The villain couple receive another assignment from the Masters: to kill [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] who had been gravely injured by the Masters, and was hospitalized. Despite being guarded by only [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]] and the [[Wasp (character)|Wasp]], Hercules survives. Creel is stung by insects in human form and Titania is shrunk to the size of Wasp. She is taken to the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]], a superhuman penitentiary.<ref>''Avengers'' #275. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The stay in the Vault does not last long. When [[Iron Man]] begins the [[Armor Wars]] (the battle to destroy or disable all enhanced armor types based on stolen Iron Man designs), it inevitably leads him to the Guardsmen, The Vault's wardens. The ensuing conflict creates a power failure, allowing Titania and [[Mister Hyde (Marvel Comics)|Mister Hyde]] to escape. While [[Captain America]] manages to subdue and capture Mister Hyde, his colleague [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]] is unsuccessful in apprehending Titania. When allowed the opportunity for a rematch, D-Man simply lets her escape because she is far stronger than him.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 1) #340 (1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Using her newfound freedom, Titania travels to Washington D.C. After losing a succession of battles with She-Hulk, Titania promises to never attack her again and returns to jail.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Broken out yet again, Titania joins with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and [[Hydro-Man]] to become the new [[Frightful Four]]. Battling the [[Fantastic Four]] with Titania taking on the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Sharon Ventura|Ms. Marvel]], the team only wins due to help from Professor Gregson Gilbert's creation [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]] and [[Aron (comics)|Aron, the Renegade Watcher]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #326-328. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the rematch, the Fantastic Four prevails only to have both teams imprisoned by Aron in suspended animation, using clones of the Fantastic Four to act out adventures he wished to witness. When both teams are freed, Aron chooses to witness the dreams of his clones instead and transports the Frightful Four back to The Vault, as a service to the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #333 (1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Titania permanently overcomes her fear of Spider-Man during the 1989-1990 "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" crossover, in which a conspiracy between [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] and the Wizard teams supervillains to fight enemies not usually their own. Titania is dismayed when Doctor Doom, her partner, tells her she would face She-Hulk and not Spider-Man. With the help of a behavior modification device secretly affixed to Titania, Doom stokes her pride and anger, allowing her to engage Spider-Man at the [[Daily Bugle]] offices. After the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]'s claws tear Doom's device from her she cowers from Spider-Man, but he makes her realize that she had been fighting him the whole time, and resumes attacking. At the time, Spider-Man was temporarily bonded with the [[Captain Universe|Uni-Power]], making him Captain Universe. This grants him the power to render Titania unconscious in one massive energy discharge.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #59. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She is freed on the way to the Vault by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] who also collects the [[Trapster]] and the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]]. All had been humiliated by Spider-Man in the Captain Universe guise and along with [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Erik Josten|Goliath]], they make a failing attempt to take revenge. Titania is humiliatingly defeated by a collision with a speeding bus.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #64-65. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Finding romance===
Escaping The Vault once again, Titania joins [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons]], as foes of [[Captain America]] and the [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].<ref>''Captain America'' #389-392. Marvel Comics.</ref> This does not work out and Titania resolves to track down her old flame&nbsp;– the Absorbing Man, finding him battling the [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]] Thor. When she appears injured by a blow from [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], Creel admits his love for her which she gladly reciprocates. Seeing this, Thor allows them to leave.<ref>''Thor'' #436. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While Creel makes an attempt to live a normal life, Titania goes back to robbing jewelry stores. Concerned, Creel attempts to "scare her straight", collaborating with Thor in a ploy involving an exhibit at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]. While the appearance of Spider-Man and special police unit Code: Blue complicates matters, ultimately Titania remembers her love for Creel.<ref>''Thor'' #447–448. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Creel continues to get mad at Mary for not managing to stay legal and violating their parole. In order to alleviate her stress he arranges an official bout with She-Hulk, but Titania nonetheless decides to cheat and ends up losing the fight.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Titania and the Absorbing Man's wedding is attended by many supervillains. While the Avengers interrupt the ceremony, they ultimately leave the couple alone.<ref>''[[Avengers Unplugged]]'' #4</ref> Titania quickly grows bored with her law-abiding reform, and after Absorbing Man tries to buy her a Valentine's present but is nonetheless attacked by the police, they accept having to live a life on the run from the law.<ref>''Marvel Valentine's Special''</ref>

In need of funds the pair assumes the guises of Thunder Girl and Lightning Bolt in order to hunt Spider-Man for the reward offered by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #429</ref> Despite Titania briefly contracting severe skin burns as a result of this escapade, the pair remains unable to reform and commit more robberies. Titania also continues to clash with She-Hulk.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #17; ''Thor'' vol. 2 #14; ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Illness and recuperation===
Despite her enhanced durability, Titania contracts [[cancer]]. Lacking both [[health insurance]] and money, Creel is quickly forced to move her from the hospital to an abandoned building. Creel kidnaps [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]] and brings her to the abandoned building to treat Titania, whose condition is rapidly deteriorating. Due to a battle between Creel and Thor, the building collapses upon the two women. Weakened and barely conscious, but still massively strong, Titania is nonetheless able to save Foster from being killed by holding up the falling debris.<ref>''Thor'' #26–27 (August–September 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> Foster subsequently helps treat Titania's cancer at the hospital.<ref>''Thor'' #28 (October 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a "silent" story containing no word balloons, Captain America fights the Absorbing Man on Christmas Eve, then learns that Creel was trying to get enough money to buy a Christmas present for Titania. Cap then secretly delivers the present in Creel's place, and remains outside their apartment window long enough to watch Titania pick up the gift. In an accompanying script excerpt, writer [[Dan Jurgens]] explains that Titania's illness has been cured.<ref>{{cite web| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20020203205228/http://marvel.com/comics/nuffsaid/capamerica50/part_4.htm | title= ''Captain America'' #50: PLOT for 22 pages| first= Dan | last= Jurgens |url= http://marvel.com/comics/nuffsaid/capamerica50/part_4.htm| website=Marvel Comics|archive-date= February 3, 2002| date= August 11, 2002 | access-date= April 19, 2019}}</ref>

During Christopher Priest's run on ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'', Titania appears as a roommate of Deadpool and the supervillain [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]],<ref>''[[Deadpool]]'' Vol. 3 #38 (March 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> but is later revealed to be the shapeshifter [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Copycat]].<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3, #45 (October 2000, page 11).

===Wielding the Power Gem===
Titania proves unable to stay away from She-Hulk, and undergoes an intense physical regimen to boost her abilities. However, She-Hulk had done so more efficiently, briefly reaching levels almost approaching those of the [[Hulk]] himself. Battered and inadvertently humiliated by her, Titania is offered the chance at revenge after obtaining the Power Gem, one of the legendary [[Infinity Gems]], from its former owner, the former [[Champion of the Universe]], now known as the Fallen One because of his own defeat at She-Hulk's hands. The Fallen One had agreed to cease using the Power Gem as a condition of his defeat, but was free to gain his own revenge by [[wikt:proxy|proxy]] through Titania. After an initial defeat by the newly empowered Titania, She-Hulk tricks her into believing that she had killed the Jade Giantess in a second battle; Titania's initial rush of triumph suddenly melts into uncertainty, as she realized that her life now had no meaning or focus without the object of her obsessive hatred. She-Hulk (in her normal form as Jennifer Walters) then takes advantage of Titania's confusion to pluck the Power Gem from the criminal's forehead, and uses the Gem's power to knock Titania out with a single punch.<ref name="ReferenceB">''She-Hulk'' Vol. 1, #12 (April 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Titania is incarcerated in the [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Lang]] Memorial Penitentiary, a.k.a. the [[Hank Pym|Pym]] Experimental Prison #2, a prison in which superhuman inmates are shrunk with Pym particles to less than an inch in height, to reduce both their chances of escape and their threat to guards and the public.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Titania appears as a member of [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|The Wizard]]'s Frightful Four, battling the Fantastic Four on Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #547. Marvel Comics.</ref> Titania is shown having been returned to the Pym Experimental Prison.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the next issue, having escaped (though still shrunken to diminutive size), she is reunited with the Absorbing Man, and clashes again with She-Hulk. To save She-Hulk from the Absorbing Man, her friend, the [[Skrull]] [[Jazinda]] uses the shrunken Titania as a hostage and throws her into the mouth of a shark.<ref>''She-Hulk'' (volume 2) #23 (2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Titania survives this somehow, as she encounters [[X-Factor Investigations]]<ref>''Second Coming Revelations: X-Factor'' #204. Marvel Comics.</ref> and is later seen at the Raft, commenting along with other female inmates on the prowess of the new warden [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Fear Itself===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, one of the seven Hammers of the Worthy lands near Titania after it was launched to Earth by [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]. When she lifts it, her body becomes possessed by Skirn: Breaker of Men.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|penciller=Stuart Immonen |inker= Wade von Grawbadger|story=The Worthy| title=Fear Itself| volume=1 |issue=2| date= July 2011| publisher=Marvel Comics| page= |panel=}}</ref> Skirn then helps Creel find his own hammer in the capital of Hell. When they find his hammer, they come across a well known thief who has a personal history with Skirn. The thief tries to take the hammer as his own, but Skirn quickly defeats him. [[War Machine]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and their allies appear and try unsuccessfully to keep the hammer from Creel, who becomes the host body for Greithoth): Breaker of Wills when he grasps it.<ref>''Iron Man 2.0'' #6 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shortly after the Worthy are defeated, a distraught Titania is shown in her prison cell imploring Raft personnel to stop Crossbones from stealing Skirn's hammer and committing atrocities with it.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Fearless'' #5 (December 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===All-New Thor===
When Absorbing Man and Titania rob an armored car, the [[Jane Foster|female Thor]] appears to thwart their plans. Upon meeting the female Thor, Creel mocks her for being a woman and for having taken Thor's name for herself, which she answers by breaking his jaw. Titania then appears to confront her. But out of respect for what Thor was doing, she knocks out her husband with his own weapon and surrenders. Despite this surrender, and despite Titania having once saved her life, Thor hits her hard with Mjolnir, knocking her out.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Illuminati===
Titania attempts to quit the supervillain lifestyle, and with She-Hulk's help, gets a security job at a pawn shop. Though she successfully stops a robbery by thugs armed with energy weapons, her powers attract the attention of [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Despite her innocence, the Heroes for Hire view her with suspicion and attempt to subdue her. In the middle of the fight, the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] teleports Titania against her will back to his lair, where he invites her to join his incarnation of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]], promising a way out of supervillainy. She reluctantly agrees to join. It is revealed to the reader that Hood engineered the robbery and is manipulating Titania.<ref>''Illuminati'' #1 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Of her new teammates, Titania is closest with her friend, the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] member [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]]. Over the short life of this team, she fights various supervillains, has a rematch with Thor, and temporarily exhibits new mystical powers, which manifest themselves as purple energy discharges while she uses her super strength.<ref>''Illuminati'' #2-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Titania and Hood attack Pleasant Hill to extract Absorbing Man. There is some brief tension between the reunited couple when Titania overhears Creel confess that he had feelings for [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] while he was under [[Kobik]]'s brainwashing.<ref>''Illuminati'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the final issue of ''Illuminati'', the Hood, having expanded his team of supervillains with the former inmates of Pleasant Hill, plots to kill the Avengers' family members out of revenge for the events of ''Avengers: Standoff!'' Titania feels that this crosses a moral line and refuses to go along. In the ensuing argument, Hood reveals that he manipulated Titania into joining the team and that he used his dark magic to give her new powers. They fight, and Titania, suspecting that Hood's mystical cloak and use of dark magic is corrupting his mind, destroys the cloak (which also removes her new powers) telling Hood that she is saving him from himself. Titania and Absorbing Man then resign themselves to remaining supervillains, though after seeing his wife stand up to the Hood and defeat him, Creel tells Titania that he can't believe that he ever had "mixed-up feelings for Elektra".<ref>''Illuminati'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Teaming with Black Bolt===
In the 2017 series ''Black Bolt'', the Absorbing Man is shown in a cosmic prison, where he befriends the Inhuman king [[Black Bolt]] and a telepathic alien girl named Blinky. Creel is seemingly killed fighting the prison's jailer, but successfully frees his fellow inmates.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Black Bolt and Blinky travel to Earth to inform Titania of her husband's heroic sacrifice. She mourns his death and arranges his funeral, which is attended by Captain America, Thor, and the Wrecking Crew. After the funeral, Black Bolt is attacked by [[Lash (comics)|Lash]]. Titania helps fight off the Inhuman villains, but is unable to prevent them from kidnapping Blinky.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the time when Jailer has possessed Blinky's mind in order to kill Black Bolt, Lockjaw took Titania to Parkwood Cemetery where Absorbing Man suddenly emerged from his grave.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Absorbing Man and Titania helped Black Bolt fight a Jailer-possessed Blinky until they managed to drive Jailer out of him.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Working with Weapon H===
[[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] hired Titania and an ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. operative named Angel to help the team led by [[Weapon H]] and [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] on a mission to [[Weirdworld]]. She calls Absorbing Man to stay out of trouble while she is away.

==Powers and abilities==
Thanks to cellular augmentation through radiation, Titania possesses immense strength that originally enabled her to match individuals such as the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], but later increased after performing rigorous prolonged weightlifting training<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 3, #10</ref> and rivals her nemesis, [[She-Hulk]]. Titania's muscles produce considerably less fatigue toxins than the muscles of an ordinary human, granting her superior stamina. Her body is completely resistant to physical attacks. She can even withstand high caliber bullets, temperature extremes, falling from great heights, and severe blunt force trauma without sustaining injury. Titania has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Eric Diazof ''[[Nerdist]]'' referred to Titania as "one of Marvel Comics’ strongest ladies," writing, "Titania isn’t Marvel’s most complicated villain. Not by a long shot. She doesn’t have the complex motivation of a Magneto nor the royal bearing of a Doctor Doom. Nope—she’s just strong. Really, really strong. Strong enough that she’s taken on the likes of Thor and walked away to tell the tale. But eventually, in her run, Titania found herself as the primary antagonist for Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Marvel Comics History of SHE-HULK's Titania |url=https://nerdist.com/article/she-hulk-titania-marvel-comics-history-mcu-future/ |access-date=2022-08-26 |website=Nerdist |language=en-US}}</ref> Renae Richardson of ''[[MovieWeb]]'' said, "Titania has proved to be one of the strongest female villains in the Marvel universe.
