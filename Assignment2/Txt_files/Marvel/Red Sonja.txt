'''Red Sonja''' is a fictional [[sword and sorcery]] comic-book [[superheroine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/red-sonja-to-become-a-superhero-in-upcoming-comic#|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|author=McMillan, Graeme|title=Red Sonja to Become a Superhero in Upcoming Comic|date=October 26, 2020|access-date=January 26, 2021|archive-date=October 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027003530/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/red-sonja-to-become-a-superhero-in-upcoming-comic}}</ref> created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] for [[Marvel Comics]] in 1973, partially inspired by [[Robert E. Howard]]'s character [[Red Sonya of Rogatino]].

Marvel Comics published stories featuring Red Sonja until 1986, and returned to the character for a one-shot story in 1995. In 2005, [[Dynamite Entertainment]] began publishing stories of the heroine, during which the original Sonja was killed and replaced by a "reincarnation". The series was rebooted by writer [[Gail Simone]] in 2013, telling an altered version of Red Sonja's early life story via flashbacks. Subsequent writers of ''Red Sonja'' have included [[Amy Chu]], [[Mark Russell (comics)|Mark Russell]], Luke Lieberman, [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], and [[Amanda Conner]], among others.

Red Sonja has appeared in numerous titles, both as a solo protagonist and together with [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], as well as in crossovers with characters from Marvel Comics and Dynamite Comics. A Red Sonja novel was published in the 1980s written by [[David C. Smith (author)|David C. Smith]] and [[Richard L. Tierney]], and in 1985, a feature film starring [[Brigitte Nielsen]] in the title role, ''[[Red Sonja (film)|Red Sonja]]'', was released.

Sonja's signature clothing is her [[bikini armor]], consisting typically of [[scale mail]]. In 2011, Red Sonja was ranked 1st in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| author-link = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 5| ISBN = 978-1-4402-2988-6}}</ref>

==History==
===Marvel Comics (1973–1995)===
Red Sonja was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] for [[Marvel Comics]] in 1973, partially based on [[Robert E. Howard]]'s character [[Red Sonya of Rogatino]], a female [[swashbuckler]] from his 1934 short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]".<ref>Afterword by [[Roy Thomas]], in ''The Chronicles of Conan Volume 4: The Song of Red Sonja and Other Stories'' (Dark Horse, 2004)</ref>

Red Sonja debuted in Marvel's ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' #23 (1973).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/redsonja.htm |title=Red Sonja}}</ref> Thomas created a new origin story and transposed the timeline from the 16th century of Howard's original Red Sonya to the [[Hyborian Age]], another Howard creation, in order to have the comic-book Red Sonja interact with [[Conan the Barbarian]]. In 1975, Marvel Comics published the first issue of ''Red Sonja'' after the character headlined ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' for seven issues that same year.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cassell|first=Dewey|title=Marvel Feature|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=18|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redsonja.com/history/|title=History|website=Red Sonja|access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref>
Red Sonja's origin story was told in the story "The Day of the Sword", in ''Kull and the Barbarians'' #3 (1975), written by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Doug Moench]] and illustrated by [[Howard Chaykin]]. The same story was later redrawn by [[Dick Giordano]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] in ''[[The Savage Sword of Conan]]'' #78 (July 1982).

In this version, Red Sonja lives with her family in a humble house in the Western [[Hyrkania (Conan)|Hyrkanian]] steppes. When she is 21, a group of mercenaries kills her family and burns down their house. Sonja attempts to defend herself, but cannot lift her brother's sword. She is [[rape]]d by the leader of the group. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess [[Scáthach]] appears to her and gives her incredible fighting skills, on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat.

Marvel's last published story featuring Red Sonja was the one-shot issue ''Red Sonja: Scavenger Hunt'' #1 (December 1995), written by Glenn Herdling and illustrated by Ken Lashley.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Sonja Scavenger Hunt (1995) comic books|url=https://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=92811|access-date=July 7, 2021|website=mycomicshop.com}}</ref>

===Dynamite Comics (2005–present)===
In 2005 [[Dynamite Comics]] began publishing ''Red Sonja''. The first series, which ran for 80 issues, continued the Marvel Comics' continuity of the character, picking up from where Marvel left off with the character in 1986. Dynamite's first series depicts the original Sonja's death in issue #34. A new character of the same name, described as a reincarnation, takes her place from issue #35 onward. A soft reboot begins in issue #50 using the same continuity as Marvel Comics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/red-sonja-movie-gail-simone-consultant/|publisher=[[CBR.com]]|author=Lovett, Jamie|language=en|title=Red Sonja Writer Gail Simone Consulting on New Movie|date=May 8, 2021|accessdate=February 12, 2022|archivedate=May 8, 2021|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508213925/https://comicbook.com/movies/news/red-sonja-movie-gail-simone-consultant/}}</ref><ref>Reed, Brian.

== Depiction of sexuality ==
=== Bikini armor ===
[[File:Red Sonja (cosplayer at New York Comic Con 2011).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cosplay]]er Mandy Caruso at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]] dressed as Red Sonja]]{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Most artists depict Red Sonja wearing a very brief "[[chainmail bikini]]" costume of [[scale armor]], usually with boots and [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]]. As originally drawn by Barry Windsor-Smith for "The Shadow of the Vulture" and "The Song of Red Sonja" in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' issues 23 and 24 (1972), she wore a long-sleeved mail shirt and short pants of red silk.<ref>''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' #23 - 24 (November - December 1972). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> 

As told by [[Roy Thomas]] in the introduction of ''Red Sonja Adventures'' Volume 1 (Dynamite Entertainment) Spanish artist [[Esteban Maroto]] submitted an uncommissioned illustration to him when he was editing the magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'' where he redesigned the character and for the first time showed her wearing what would become her famous costume, the silver "metal bikini", which resembled other fantasy costumes that other Maroto heroines sported in the 1970s. This illustration had been printed for the first time in [[Jim Steranko]]'s magazine ''Comixscene'' #5 in black and white. It was reprinted in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and in ''[[Marvel Treasury Edition]]'' #15 colored but poorly reproduced, and finally restored and colored by [[José Villarrubia]] as an alternative cover for the Dynamite Entertainment edition of ''Red Sonja'' #2. Maroto drew her in this costume for a double page spread illustration in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #3 and then for her first solo adventure in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and [[John Buscema]] drew her in this costume in the same magazine. Buscema drew her again in this costume in issues 43, 44 and 48 of  ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1974) and [[Dick Giordano]] in the first issue of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' vol. 2 (Nov. 1975) before [[Frank Thorne]] took over from issue #2 (Jan. 1976).

=== Bisexuality ===
In 2016, author Gail Simone indicated that Sonja was bisexual during her run.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GailSimone/status/751546828722573312|author=[[Simone, Gail]]|title=Untitled|date=July 8, 2016|access-date=June 30, 2020|publisher=[[Twitter]]|archive-date=March 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305151759/https://twitter.com/GailSimone/status/751546828722573312}}</ref> In 2020, the series ''Red Sonja: The Price of Blood'' by writer Luke Lieberman and artist Walter Geovani corroborated this, depicting Sonja as having slept with a woman.<ref>''Red Sonja - The Price of Blood'' #1 (2020).
