An alternate equivalent of Arno Stark has since been seen in the mainstream [[Earth-616]] continuity as the previously unknown brother of [[Iron Man]]. He is revealed to have been genetically altered by the [[Recorder (comics)|Recorder]] known as 451, intending for the child to grow up to pilot a suit of armor known as the Godkiller. Upon learning this, [[Howard Stark]] sabotaged the experiment which rendered Arno being born crippled and unable to speak without the use of machines.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #9â€“12. Marvel Comics.</ref> His existence was purposefully kept a secret until decades later when he was discovered by Tony Stark at the [[Maria Stark]] Foundation.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> He and Tony began transforming the decrepit Mandarin City into a futuristic utopia called Troy.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #19.

Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Arno had deployed his [[Iron Man's armor|own suit]] of Iron Man's armor with which he later helped Iron Man and the Trojan Guard fight the enemy forces. After realizing the city would never be safe as long as he was attached to it, Tony quit working directly on Troy, leaving Arno the position of the city's new custodian.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Arno later worked on a remake of the [[Extremis]] virus.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> This Extremis was used to cure [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] of his head injury.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> His technology advancements also eventually allowed him to rewrite his own DNA and abate the symptoms of his congenital disease, though he would assume he had fully conquered his sickness.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, his comatose brother was placed in a rejuvenating pod of Arno's design.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Tony Stark awoke and laid low until recovering, Arno was recruited into a search party.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #597-599. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Amanda Armstrong was confronted by Hydra double agent Jude, Arno was among those who responded to [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s distress call.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #600.

As he went on a globetrotting journey, Arno met [[Sunset Bain]].<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> He joined up with Sunset Bain's company Baintronics in a plot to steal data from Stark Unlimited.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Amidst the crisis in Tony's eScape virtual reality program, Arno hacked Stark Unlimited's surveillance systems and found confronting virtual versions of Howard and Maria called Arsenal Beta and Mistress. He then witnessed Tony using brain power to construct the Godbuster Armor. After Arsenal Beta and Mistress are deleted, Arno salvaged their digital engrams and the Godbuster Armor data.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when Iron Man was dealing with [[Ultron]] / [[Hank Pym]]'s plot to fuse [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] with [[Wasp (character)|Wasp]], Arno used the engrams of Howard and Maria and the bio-restructuring pods to create duplicates of his parents that also had their memories and thoughts.<ref>''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> When it was discovered that his brother is just a simulation and actually died during the ''Civil War II'' storyline, Arno used this to his advantage to acquire Stark Unlimited through a merger with Baintronics.

Now having a new destiny, Arno became the latest person to take on the Iron Man mantle.<ref name="Tony Stark: Iron Man #19">''Tony Stark: Iron Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" storyline, Arno had become convinced the Earth was now in danger from the looming threat of an alien A.I. aberration called the Extinction Entity, in reality a delusion caused by Arno's dormant disease which was going to return and kill him in less than a year. He attempted to prevent this by uniting humanity against this cause, the efforts of which would only enslave it. Realizing he wouldn't be able to convince Arno of his delusion, Tony encased his half-brother in a virtual armor that acts as a life support system while also submerging him in a re-made version of Tony's eScape program, creating a fantasy world where Arno defeated the Extinction Entity and could go on to be the hero he'd always wanted to be.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' #1-6.
