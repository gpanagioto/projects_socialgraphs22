 Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids. Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks? Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh? Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime  here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow. It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes!  Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled. You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you.
