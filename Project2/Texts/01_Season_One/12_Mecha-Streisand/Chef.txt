Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV. Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at an Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in ''my'' cafeteria. I'm Chef. Barbra Streisand? You mean like, ''the'' Barbra Streisand? No. Not since '''Yentl'''. Too late for what? Why do ''you'' care? I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin. Come on, man. What is this all about? Hmmm. Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope. Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a rumor. It was ''just a rumor.'' A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.  Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about! Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-. Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman? Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this! Forget I asked! And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has? ''Mega''-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell ''that'' means, but it doesn't sound good. Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all. There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B. Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too! Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin? Where? Ooh, fudge! Children! I can't - break these - locks! Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure? This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you. Look out, children! Sidney Poitier? Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in ''my'' hometown! Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.  Is ''that'' really necessary?  It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town. We have to say good-bye... to South Park.  Who are you? You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin ''and'' Sidney Poitier. Hey! Where's he goin'?
