No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders! No, Kitty!   No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?  Yes. Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!  Mom! Mom!  Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store! Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!  Mom-Mom! I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store!  ...But Mom, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.  ...But Mom, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool! Sweet. Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon.  Oh, god damnit!  Hey, dickhole. I guess you saw the commercial, too. Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the cutest.  C'mon. C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha-- C'mon. C'mon. Give me Pengin! C'mon! Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin. God damn it, you're supposed to trade, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!  You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon? Oh, please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday. Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle. It's all Chinpokomon now. You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?  Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master! Duhhh! Duhhh! Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.  Cool! This game rules! I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon... <poem><i>Come on, brothers and sisters<br />We've all got to join together<br />Join together and give me money<br />So I can buy more Chinpokomon!<br />We've got to stop this fight and...</i></poem> I haven't made any money yet. Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?! Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!  The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power. Oh, my God, that's so yesterday! Like, eight days ago. Get outta the way! Move it! Ohhh. Is this cool or not? I can't tell. Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana.  Minna-san! Kite kite, churi...  ...Gay. Gay. Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
