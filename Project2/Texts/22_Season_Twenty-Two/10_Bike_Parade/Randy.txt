I can't even believe you would say that, Sharon! It's the stupid Amazon strike! I rely on things for marketing, Sharon! A small business needs products for exposure, and until those assholes go back to work, small businesses are gonna suffer!   Aw yeah yeah, Of course. Out early today, huh?  Yeah, tell me about it. Uh, yeah.  You're strikers? Okay, okay, hold on. Uh, let me got some more weed.  Huh.  All right, there you go, friend. That's an ounce of weed, and thanks for supportin' small business. Next? Sorry friend, that's the law. Us simple farmin' folk respect the law and each other.  Well don't buy weed from them. Their weed sucks. Shit! This whole Amazon strike has more people smoking weed than ever. We have to make sure Tegridy Weed stays ahead of the competition! Yeah, like a, like a delivery service. Some way so people don't have to drive out here and even see the other weed farms! You mean the things that almost killed us all on Halloween? Yeah, I 'member.  Oh shit. We could have Tegridy all over town.   Bezos! Bezos! Hello Bezos! You can take your fulfillment center and fulfill it right up your ass! See, there's one thing you didn't count on, and that's Tegridy! Just look in the eyes of these people!  Everyone has Tegridy now! Tegridy that you will never understand! We aren't just different classes of people anymore, we are a town! Why do you ask that? Oh. Hang on.  Hold on. Okay, I got it. Anyways... you see, Tegridy is something that can't be understood by big corporations! Oh, they'll try to package Tegridy, but only I can really package Tegridy. I got more money now 'cause of Tegridy, and that's 'cause I figured out how to get Tegridy to everyone. And that's- now everyone is in their state of Tegridy that's impenetrable. Am I making sense? The point is, nobody's comin' to work for you! So you can take your whole plan and fulfill it somewhere else!
