Oh, hey Randy. I've never heard of one that big. Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history! But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!  Hey. Hey that's right. Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken! That's great, Randy!
