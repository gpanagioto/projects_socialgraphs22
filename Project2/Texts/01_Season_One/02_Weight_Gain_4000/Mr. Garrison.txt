Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month?  One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize. That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman. Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper. Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner. Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford? And the presentation will be on national television.  Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it. Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement. Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat? Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child. It wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that? How? No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't <i>kill Kathie Lee Gifford!</i> That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.  Mr. Hat! Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her. No, no! No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it. That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat. Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy. Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top. Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage. Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage. Do you have a feather on your head? Then you're an Indian. Okay Bebe, this is your line. They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy. Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days. To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford! Oh my God, what have I said? I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it. Yes... I need a gun. Other.  I don't know, it's a little small.  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.  I'll take it! Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang! Thank you. Thanks. Hello Officer Barbrady. Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee. Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady. Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford. Come on you little bitch.  You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy. Leave us. We must finish what we have begun. You can't know. ...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once. It is... too late for me, young Wendy. You... you're right. Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy. I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV. Really, on what?
