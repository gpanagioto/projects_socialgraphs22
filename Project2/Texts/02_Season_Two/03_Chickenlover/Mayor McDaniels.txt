I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful. He is. No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force. Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh-- Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?! Well, how's the reading coming along? Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night. The perpetrator left ''this clue'' at the crime scene.  You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady! Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!
