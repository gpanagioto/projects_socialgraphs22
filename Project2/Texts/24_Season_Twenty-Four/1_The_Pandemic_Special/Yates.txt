Alright, men! As you all know, due to recent events totally beyond our control, we have lost most of our funding. But this new venture will be great. and I know we will all thrive as elementary schoolteachers. This might be our last chance at a job, so I don't want any unnecessary deaths.  Ahp! Ahp! No unnecessary deaths! And let's show this town just what great leaders we can be. This is gonna be great. Alright, children, welcome back to class. I'm your new teacher, Detective Harris, and this is our homeroom teacher's assistant, Officer Johnston. Let's start the day off with some math. Does anyone understand math? Who would like to lead the class with some math?  I don't know if I can do this, Mitch. I fuckin' hate kids. I can't be a teacher. Got 'im! Alright, students. shut up.  I know this situation is not ideal, but we all have to quarantine together for two weeks. You don't want to infect your families, do you? You were all exposed to a student here who was taken to the hospital due to COVID. Yes? Yes, due to COVID. If it weren't for COVID, all the previous teachers would have still been here, we wouldn't have been in the class, and nobody would have gotten shot. Therefore, the young man is in the hospital due to COVID.  Don't blame this on us teachers! You opened the school and gave us barely enough resources to do our job! Well, I don't know what you're gonna do, Mayor. You took all our funding away. You said our equipment was too extreme. Now, if we had some of that stuff back... Tsst-tst-tst-ch-ch-ch!  Boys? We are back in business! Possible COVID exposure at 4 o'clock!   Protesting slash looting is a violation of the Mayor's health order! You have five minutes to come out or we will have to take action All right, that was about five minutes.  Who the hell is that?
