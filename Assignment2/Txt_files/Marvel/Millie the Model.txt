'''''Millie the Model''''' was [[Marvel Comics]]' longest-running humor title, first published by the company's 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], and continuing through its 1950s forerunner, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], to 1970s Marvel.

==Publication history==
The series ran 207 issues ([[cover-date]]d Winter 1945 to Dec. 1973),<ref name=gcd /> a 28-year span that included one of the first Marvel Comics annuals (in 1962),<ref name=gcd-annual>[http://www.comics.org/series/1516/ ''Millie the Model Annual''] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> and spin-offs including ''A Date with Millie'',<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1206/ ''A Date with Millie'' (Marvel, 1956 Series)] and [http://www.comics.org/series/1440/ ''A Date with Millie'' (Marvel, 1956 Series)] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> ''Life with Millie'',<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1457/ ''Life with Millie''] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> ''Mad About Millie''<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1910/ ''Mad About Millie''] and [http://www.comics.org/series/1990/ ''Mad About Millie Annual''] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> and ''Modeling with Millie''.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1573/ ''Modeling with Millie''] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> At first a funny career-gal book about New York City model Millie Collins, it very quickly changed into a wider, more slapstick comedy– though for a time becoming a [[Romance comics|romantic adventure]] series with all the same characters (#113–153, March 1963 – Aug. 1967) before returning to humor.<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/series/417/ ''Millie the Model Comics''] and [http://www.comics.org/series/79395/ ''Millie the Model''] (same series; numbering consistent following title change) at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> Both the trademarked cover title and the copyrighted title as per its postal indicia are ''Millie the Model Comics'' through issue #94; the cover title then becomes simply ''Millie the Model'', although the copyrighted title did not change to match until issue #144.<ref name=gcd />

The character was created by writer-artist [[Ruth Atkinson]], one of the pioneering women [[cartoonists]] in comic books.<ref>{{cite book| title=Marvel Chronicle | editor-first=Elizabeth | editor-last=Dowsett| publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | date=2008| isbn= 978-0756641238|chapter =Millie the Model debuts| page=31|quote= ''Millie the Model'' was created by cartoonist Ruth Atkinson, who drew the stories in the first issue.

The character's essential look, however, was the work of future [[Archie Comics]] great [[Dan DeCarlo]], who would later create ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' and other Archie icons. DeCarlo's 10-year run on the series, from #18–93 (June 1949 – Nov. 1959), was succeeded by the team of writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Stan Goldberg]], a.k.a. "Stan G.", the main Atlas/Marvel colorist at the time. Goldberg mimicked the house style DeCarlo set, and later went on to work with him at Archie, as did occasional ''Millie'' artist [[Henry Scarpelli]]. [[Al Hartley]] and [[Ogden Whitney]] provided an occasional cover.<ref name=gcd />

The occasional backup feature included a four-page "[[Powerhouse Pepper]]" story by cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]] in #9, and work by humorist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] in #8, 10–11, 13–14, & 16. Lee and Goldberg had Marvel artist and major industry figure [[Jack Kirby]] guest-star in a story in #107 (March 1962), though the image itself did not look like Kirby.<ref name=gcd />

Millie became part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with ''[[The Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #3 (1965), which chronicled the wedding of [[Reed Richards]] and [[Susan Storm]]. Fellow humor-comic stars [[Hellcat (comics)|Patsy Walker]] and Hedy Wolfe, among the sidewalk crowd outside, talk about wanting to catch a glimpse of celebrity Millie, whom they've heard is on the guest list. [[Alex Ross]] depicted her at the ceremony when he revisited the wedding in the 1990s miniseries ''[[Marvels]]''.

She reappeared in the 1980s as an older character running her own modeling agency and minding her niece, the titular star of writer-artist [[Trina Robbins]]' ''Misty'' (Dec. 1985 – May 1986), from Marvel's children's-oriented [[Star Comics]] imprint.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/misty.htm |title=Misty}}</ref> Millie has also appeared in the superhero comics ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #65 (Nov. 1978); ''[[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]'' #34 (Oct. 1985); ''[[She-Hulk|The Sensational She-Hulk]]'' #60 (Feb. 1994); and in the [[kitsch]]y [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] series ''The Age of the Sentry'' #3 (Jan. 2009).

Millie starred alongside [[Patsy Walker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]] in a 23-page story "Un-enchanted Evening", by writer [[Paul Tobin (writer)|Paul Tobin]] and artist [[Colleen Coover]], in ''King-Size Spider-Man Summer Special'' #1 (Oct. 2008). Millie stars in the four-issue [[miniseries]] ''Models, Inc.'' (Oct. 2009 – Jan. 2010).

==Fictional character biography==
Aspiring model Millie Collins of Sleepy Gap, Kansas, moves to New York. She meets photographer Clicker (originally Flicker) Holbrook who arranges an introduction at the Hanover Modelling Agency. She is hired as a model by the agency. At the start of the series her best friend was regular character [[Toni Turner]]; later on Toni became a recurring character, and her role as best friend and confidant was Daisy, the agency's wardrobe assistant. She becomes romantically involved with Clicker Holbrook. At one point, she shares an apartment on the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] with Toni Turner. Near the end of the series, Millie and Daisy shared an apartment.

Throughout the series, redheaded model [[Chili Storm]] was Millie's friendly nemesis (Millie: "Sorry I'm late! I just got back from the salon!"  Chili: "Too bad they didn't have time to take you!" Millie [ringing phone drawn in foreground]: "Oh, there's the phone". Chili: "Wow!  I'll bet you can also identify doorbells and auto horns!"). When Millie wasn't around, however, Chili would sometimes speak up for her colleague. Chili starred in her own 1969–1973 spin-off series.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/1908/ ''Chili''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=136}}</ref>

In addition to regular appearances by Millie, Chili, Clicker and Daisy, there were occasional appearances by Howard Hanover, Toni Turner, Marvin, Agnes Ames (in charge of Wardrobe at the modeling agency) and a colleague who helped with agency sets and maintenance, Chili's wealthy boyfriend Reginald Goldmine, and Miss Scrubbley. Very late in the series, Mr. Hanover had a daffy platinum-blonde assistant, Dolly. Millie's parents are Nancy and Henry Collins. She has one younger brother, Henry Collins Jr.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
In 1968, ''Millie the Model'' won an [[Alley Award]] for "Best Romance Comic" at the [[Comic Art Convention|New York Comic Art Convention]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=1968 Alley Awards |url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/alley68.php |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=www.hahnlibrary.net}}</ref>

Jerry Stanford of ''[[CBR.com]]'' stated, "This is probably the best known of all comics Marvel published outside of the super-hero genre. The character was created by pioneering female creator Ruth Atkinson, who also created Patsy Walker. It had five spin-offs in its 28-year run. The genre of the book went from "working girl" to humor and romance."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stanford |first=Jerry |date=2020-03-31 |title=Marvel: 10 Series That Weren't About Superheroes or Supervillains |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-series-comics-underrated/ |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2003, Marvel's then-president, [[Bill Jemas]], told the press there were plans to reimagine Millie as a 15-year-old tennis player for a comic-book series called ''15 Love'', to be targeted at teenaged girls. The possibility of a Millie movie was also mentioned at that time.<ref>Archive of MacDonald, Heidi. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091310/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic%3Bf%3D36%3Bt%3D000762%3Bp%3D1 "Millie the Model Turns to Tennis?"], Comicon.com, March 4, 2003.</ref> ''15 Love'' was eventually published in 2011.

It ran for three issues, with each as a double-sized 56-page story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/06/03/marvel-comics-exclusive-preview-15-love-1/ |title=Marvel Comics Exclusive Preview: ''15 Love'' #1" |publisher=[[MTV]].com |date=June 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606053607/http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/06/03/marvel-comics-exclusive-preview-15-love-1 |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
