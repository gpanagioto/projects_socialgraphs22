Joker drives Jeremiah to near insanity until the [[Batman]] saves him.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Black Mask II (Dr. Jeremiah Arkham {{!}} Prime Earth) (Comic Book Character)|url=https://comicbookrealm.com/report/character/7471/black-mask-ii-dr-jeremiah-arkham&t=indexing-history|access-date=2021-07-31|website=Comic Book Realm}}</ref> 

In ''[[Batman: No Man's Land]]'', Jeremiah heads to the ruins of [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham]] and finds his late uncle [[Amadeus Arkham|Amadeus]]' journal. Jeremiah decides to rebuild [[Arkham Asylum]] in his uncle's image. While the asylum is finishing renovations, workplace accidents begin to pile up, including [[Killer Croc]]'s tank filtration rupturing, [[Mr. Freeze]]'s room gets warmer, along with the Raggedy Man being freed. Later on, Alyce Sinner is shown to be having sexual relations with [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask (Roman Sionis)]].

In [[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]], Arkham is causing mass-destruction in [[Gotham City|Gotham]] even [[Arson|exploding]] [[Arkham Asylum]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Battle for the Cowl (Story Arc)|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/battle-for-the-cowl/4045-55808/|access-date=2021-08-18|website=Comic Vine|language=en}}</ref> This is his first appearance as Black Mask as it activated after hearing of Batman's death and threatened escapees with acidic nanites of [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] to join him as he raised chaos in Gotham. His new scheme of new False Face Society didn't last after [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]] found out about the nanites and burned them out, forcing Mask to flee from him but the new [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] with only Zsasz becoming his new associate.

In 2011, "[[The New 52]]" rebooted the DC universe. When the [[Court of Owls|Talons]] attack the Asylum, Dr. Arkham gives Sionis his mask back to telepathically influence the inmates into attacking the Talons and keep anyone from following Arkham to his safe room. Black Mask then attempts to use his abilities on Batman, but fails and is forced to escape the asylum.<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol. 2 #9. DC Comics.</ref>

In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called "[[DC Rebirth]]", which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to "The New 52". Jeremiah at one point had sexual relations with Dr. Ingrid Karlsson who gave birth to their child, then Karlsson died during a riot in Arkham Asylum. To keep his daughter Astrid Arkham safe, Jeremiah raised her within the walls of Arkham Asylum, where she developed a hatred for the [[Batman]] and she later became the [[Arkham Knight]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arkham Knight (Character)|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/arkham-knight/4005-156487/|access-date=2021-07-31|website=Comic Vine|language=en}}</ref>
