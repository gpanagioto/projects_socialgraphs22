Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-. Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat? Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next. Well, just make something up, like Eric did. Excellent. A-. Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people. Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan. Well of course Stanley, what is it? Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down. Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold, black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand? Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual. Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda. What do you mean? What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay. I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass. Hey hey, where is little Stanley? Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.  It's obvious where all the talent in that family went! I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo. What the hell is he talking about? Do what?
