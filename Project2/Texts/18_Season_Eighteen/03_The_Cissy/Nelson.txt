Yes? Yeah, that's right.  Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay? I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life. Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology. She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch.
