==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===

Mannheim and his minions kidnap [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]], Goody Rickels, and the [[Newsboy Legion]] and has them eat a meal laced with pyro-granulate. After letting them go, Bruno states that they will burn up in 24 hours.<ref>''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #139. DC Comics.</ref>

Guardian forced Bruno Mannheim into giving up the antidote for the pyro-granulate enabling him to save himself, Jimmy Olsen, and Goody Rickels as wells as the Newsboy Legion.<ref>''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #141. DC Comics.</ref>

===Post-Crisis===
In the ''Post-Crisis'', Bruno Mannheim is a member of Intergang. While Superman was dealing with a storm, Mannheim called a meeting with the Intergang council of war where they need to find a way to discredit Clark Kent, [[Lois Lane]], and [[Cat Grant]] before Morgan Edge's trial.<ref>''Action Comics'' #653. DC Comics.</ref>

Mannheim and Intergang collaborate with [[Toyman]] when using Apokoliptian technology in his revenge on [[Lex Luthor]]. When Mannheim complains that Toyman is going to attract attention to him, Toyman urges Mannheim to stay out of his affairs.<ref>''Action Comics'' #657. DC Comics.</ref>

During the "''[[Infinite Crisis]]''" storyline, Mannheim become one of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most powerful gangsters and the leader of the Intergang.<ref>''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 (2005). DC Comics.</ref>

Since his return in the miniseries ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', he claims now to have been "reborn" thanks to the [[New God]] [[Darkseid]], and to have become a psychopath. During Week 25, now a devoted worshipper of crime itself, he has Intergang follow "The [[Crime Bible]]" of which the original copy is bound by the stone with which [[Cain]] killed [[Abel]]. He is also been shown to now be a cannibal, killing and then eating those whom do not submit to (or simply do not immediately join) Intergang like he did with [[Mirage (DC Comics)|Mirage]]. Bruno Mannheim later abducted [[Kite Man]], Lamelle, Rawson, Sewer King, and [[Squid (DC Comics)|Squid]] in order to get them to join Intergang. Some of them turned him down and were killed as a result.<ref>''52'' Week Twenty-Five. DC Comics.</ref>

Over the course of the series, he comes into conflict with [[Renee Montoya]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and the new [[Batwoman]], whom he wishes to sacrifice. As of Week 48, Mannheim has captured Batwoman and has her bound and gagged to a sacrificial altar, stabbing her through the heart shortly thereafter. When Montoya arrives and rescues her lover, Batwoman rips Mannheim's knife out of her own chest and impales him in the back, seemingly fatally. This is during Mannheim's attempt to turn Gotham into a miniature replica of [[Apokolips]]. Batwoman survives her injuries.<ref>''52'' Week Forty-Eight. DC Comics.</ref>

Superman encounters him several weeks later, mutated to be several stories tall. Before teleporting away, he states that Darkseid is not his master anymore. Based on that comment, someone else is behind Intergang's recent activity.<ref>''Superman'' #654. DC Comics.</ref>
