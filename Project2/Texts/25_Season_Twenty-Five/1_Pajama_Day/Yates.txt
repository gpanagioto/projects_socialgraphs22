Jesus, I've never seen so many arrests in one day! But she's wearing pajamas. Alright, put her in with the others. What now? Oh, finally something normal! Okay, Mr. Billings, but... you have to understand, it is bedtime. Well, you should just understand where your wife is coming from. If any time makes sense to wear pajamas, it would be as you're going to sleep at night. Alright, alright, listen. What if you were on a ski vacation. Hmm? A nice cozy condo after a long day hitting the slopes. The fire is crackling. You've got a cup of cocoa. You're telling me you wouldn't wear pajamas then? Alright, alright, is there any way the two of you could go to sleep tonight in this house together? Okay, then you can just come sleep downtown at the station. Take her in, boys. Take him in, too!  Arrest those people, and all of those people! This whole town is a powder keg about to go off. And tomorrow is pajama day. Alright, you can all go home. It's opposite day. That's fine, you can all wear whatever you want as long as it covers your dick and tits.
