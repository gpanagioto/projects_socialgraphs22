You look familiar. Don't you go to my school? I'm Leslie. Did they bring you in and give you a bunch of tests too? I think they're ex-newsmen. You know, the men in suits who used to be in charge of the news. They told me I was special. Are you special too?  I like that. Do you like our school, Jimmy. I like our school too. I like the kids who go there. I'm starting to wonder about you. I mean, you seem like a nice kid, but... don't you feel like you could be happier?  What? Okay.
