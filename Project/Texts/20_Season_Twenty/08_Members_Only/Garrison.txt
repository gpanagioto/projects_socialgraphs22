 Well, do I look presidential? They really worked on my stank face. Look! Whenever I don't know what people are talking about, I just do this,  They did a really good job on my stank lips. Now I feel ready to take care of business and do what really matters...  in just a minute, I'm gonna do the UV rays a bit longer.  So sorry for the intrusion. You're not too busy, I hope. Excuse me? That's better, bitch.  Do you remember the day you fired me, PC Principal? I was upset because a bunch of immigrants were changing my class and I believe your response was that I needed to go and "learn their language", "be more open-minded". Are you really?  Because you see PC Principal, you helped create me. You insisted that I was a bigot, that I was an intolerant relic left over from another time. But now, I'm your president. And if there's one thing I've learned about becoming president, it's that your penis can get really ''dry''. When all the skin on your penis is drying out from working ''so'' hard to get elected there's only one thing that can fix it, isn't there? Saliva, from a good friend who once doubted you. I need you to fix my problem, PC Principal, so that we can be even-stevens. What do you say, bud? Hey everybody!  Hello, Stephen.  This is the President. Oh, really? I'm kinda busy right now, jeez. War?  So I can do whatever the fuck I want in here now, right?  Okay, good. Thanks! Oh that will come in handy. Oh hell yeah, it's necessary. Let's do it. Love me some football.  Well, jeez, this doesn't look very fun. Why? What the hell happened? What's TROLL TRACE? For what? Well, why are you asking me? Well why would we care about Mexicans?! Well what does that even mean?! I don't know, jeez! What? Memberries? Get inside your head... Wait a minute... Nobody gets in my head, you limey bitch! Are you insulting me?! Stop wasting my time! 'Cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours suckin' my dick!!
