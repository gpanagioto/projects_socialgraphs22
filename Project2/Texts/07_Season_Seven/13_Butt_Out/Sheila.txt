Smoking? Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault. No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them ''wanna'' smoke. We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner. So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke? Well then, you are grounded, mister!
