For what? What? Wow. Our town has only had a Whole Foods for three weeks and we already have our first gay kids. So cool.  Hey, bud. How's it hangin'?  Well, guess what? You've got a really progressive PC dad who knows all about this stuff, okay? Go ahead, ask me anything. Ah, well, you see, it's a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.  Uh are y-, yeah, yeah they do. Uh, the Asians just, you know, the Asians pick who they pick, and um, it's al- it's, the way it's always been.  Yeah, of course. Yaoi, anal intercourse, Maui Zaui, I, I know all this stuff, Stan.  Uh, hi, Mr. Jinping. Thanks for taking my call, I was... just wondering if you could shed some light on how your people decide who will be gay and who will be straight.  I'm sorry, I-I don't speak Asian, but... um, oh uh, oh, y-yao, yaoi. Yaoi, yes? Boizu rabu. Huh, how does that work? Oh, it's Japan that decides?  Aaaa-a-ah, Japan. Of course, is who does the yaoi to make people gay. Uh huh, yes, that of course I do already know about homosexuality. Hey, hey, whoa, you didn't do anything. Yeah, let me handle thisk guys, I'm PC. Look, Thomas, you need to understand that being gay isn't a decision. You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide who's gay and who's not. But it isn't all Asians, it's just specifically the Japanese, okay?  Well, it all goes back to World War II, and atrocities that happened in China called the Rape of Don King. Yes I do.
