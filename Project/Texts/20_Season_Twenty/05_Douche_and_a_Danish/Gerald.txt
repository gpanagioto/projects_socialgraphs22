 It's Gerald. Alright? Alright, look. How do you troll somebody? No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh. It's not mean if it's hilarious. If we all worked together? Maybe.  Maybe. Okay, come on. Office is upstairs.  Oh, hi honey. Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up. Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much!  Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins. Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am. 	What? I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz. Skankhunt42 standing by. Alright, engaging Twitter... now! Prepare for overreaction on my mark. 3... 2... Mark. Did they pick it up on Yahoo? Oh, shit! Go to, go to Huffington! 	Oh yes! This is CNN front page right now. Oh, Kyle! Ahh, hey, I didn't think you'd be leaving yet. 	Well, did you see what was all over the Internet? Everyone's ripping on LEGOs. Yeah, now the whole world is blowing up with Danish jokes. It's hilarious. Wow, fuck Denmark, huh Kyle? That's gotta be what just about everyone is thinking now. Fuck Denmark.
