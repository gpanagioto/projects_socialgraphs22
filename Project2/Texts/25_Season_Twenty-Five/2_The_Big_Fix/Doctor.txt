Hey-hey! Stan the man! How ya doin' buddy?  The nurse said you came here by yourself. No parents? Oh, okay, pal. What is it? Well, kiddo... you don't normally go to a doctor's office for feeling racist, but tell me what happened. Uh huh, Tolkien. Great name. Uh huh... and how long have you thought that? Wow. Fuck you. You really thought a couple of black people had a child and named him Token? Why would anyone name a black kid Token? You're a piece of shit. You were just going along with the dominant culture of the white paradigm, that's what you were just– Get out of my office, you make me sick! I don't know what's wrong with some people. I wonder if anyone else thought that this kid's name was Token? Hmm? Anybody? Anyone else just assume his name was Token? Because that's disgusting, and you are the problem. I thought I told you to get out of my office, because you seriously make me sick– I'm gonna shit my fucking pants right now. Oh, you wanna change? Then I suggest you start doing a lot of reading.  The story of young Stan Marsh might seem incredible, but the fact is many people suffer from unconscious biases.  If you or someone you know might have also thought the name Tolkien didn't come from J.R.R. Tolkien, then please call... 1-800-I AM A GIANT PIECE OF SHIT. Because you are the fucking problem.
