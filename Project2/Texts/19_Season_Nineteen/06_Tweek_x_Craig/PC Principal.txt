Alright, everyone, listen up.  from our Asian-American students presented by our student-body president, Wendy Testaburger. Alright, guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me. What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that. That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent. IF there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration. Now in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright? I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to touch Craig's penis, you can't just go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like "Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?" Okay? Let's try it out. You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important! Okay, good. Now, Craig, you might say "You may touch my penis. I'm comfortable with that.".  Or of course you could say "No, you may not touch my penis at this time.". Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now, Craig, what would you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole? Hello, Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today. Yes, with his boyfriend. Just a lovers' quarrel, probably.  Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis. There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day.
