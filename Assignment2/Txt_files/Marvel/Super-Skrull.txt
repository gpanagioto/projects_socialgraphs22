Super-Skrull first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #18 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

=={{anchor|Fictional character biography}}Fictional character biography==
The Super-Skrull is from the [[Skrull]] world of Tarnax IV (in the Tarnax system of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]), which has been destroyed by [[Galactus]]. He was a decorated soldier in the army and married a Skrull countess from the planet Zaragz'na and had two children, his beloved son named Sarnogg and a daughter named [[Jazinda]], whom he despised.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> Because of his duty, he was kept away from his family and after the defeats outnumbered his victories, he was banished from Zaragz'na and was not allowed to see his son due to his wife.<ref name=AnSuSk14/>

Skrull emperor [[Dorrek VII]] devised a way to strike back against the [[Fantastic Four]], who thwarted the Empire's invasion of Earth.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=333}}</ref> Dorrek chose the warrior Kl'rt, who was given the combined abilities of the Fantastic Four. Kl'rt was stronger than the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]]; had superior flight and greater pyrokinetic ability than the [[Human Torch]]; had better control of invisibility and force fields than the [[Invisible Woman]], and could stretch further than [[Reed Richards|Mister Fantastic]]. The Super-Skrull retained his shapeshifting and hypnotic abilities, and was sent to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four and pave the way for a new Skrull Empire invasion.

During their first encounter, the Super-Skrull keeps the Fantastic Four at bay and forces them to retreat. Mister Fantastic senses that Kl'rt's powers are augmented by an energy beam from the Skrull homeworld. Blocking the beam with a device placed on him by the Invisible Girl deprives Kl'rt of his new powers. Defeated, he is imprisoned in a crater by the Human Torch when he pursues the Invisible Girl.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #18 (Sep. 1963). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Super-Skrull returns as the Invincible Man after the Skrulls restored his powers to fight the Fantastic Four. He breaks out of his prison, travels to New York and kidnaps [[Human Torch|Johnny]] and Sue Storm's jailed father [[Franklin Storm]]. The Fantastic Four recognize his deception and return him in exchange for Storm. Storm dies when a bomb placed on him by the Skrull Warlord Morrat (in a final attempt to kill the Four) explodes, but he saves the Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Super-Skrull was among the villains summoned by [[Doctor Doom]] to attack Reed and Sue at their wedding, but Mister Fantastic used a machine to remove the villain's memories.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Repeatedly sent back to Earth, he battles [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Thor'' #142 (Jul. 1967). Marvel Comics.</ref> and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #2-3 (Jun.-Jul. 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Super-Skrull is the Empire's agent on Earth during the [[Kree-Skrull War]]; he temporarily disbands the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and kidnaps Mar-Vell, the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #89-97 (Jun. 1971-Mar. 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref> With the war ending in a truce, the disgraced Super-Skrull sides with [[Thanos]] and (with Skragg) aids Thanos in his quest for the [[Cosmic Cube]]. The Super-Skrull, attempting to capture [[Rick Jones (character)|Rick Jones]] for Thanos, fights Mar-Vell and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]; Mar-Vell defeats him and Thanos.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #25-33 (Nov. 1970-Apr. 1971).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

A Canadian research team accidentally pulls Kl'rt back from deep space. He kills the group except for the physicist superhero, [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]. Kl'rt discovers that the radiation belt has given him [[cancer]]. Sasquatch is initially defeated by the Super-Skrull but tricks him, converting him into a stream of dissociated particles and sending him back into deep space.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #9-10 (Apr.-May 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Super-Skrull, later freed by the [[Silver Surfer]], discovers that his cancer is in remission (apparently due to a "chronal anomaly" which reverted his cellular makeup to its precancerous state).<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #25-31 (Jul.-Dec. (last two issues in one month) 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kl'rt is freed from the Van Allen belt and cured of cancer by the sorcerer [[Master Khan]],<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> and used against hero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Khan brainwashes the Super-Skrull into believing that he is Bobby Wright, a twelve-year-old boy who acquires superhuman powers and a terminal disease from exposure to an alien spore. "Bobby" uses his powers to assume the identity of adult superhuman Captain Hero and ingratiate himself with Iron Fist and his crime-fighting partner, [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]. Captain Hero's misuse of powers leaves Iron Fist apparently dead and triggers his disintegration.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #15-18 (Jun.-Sep. 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Super-Skrull's imprisonment shielded him from the effects of Zabyk's Disaster, when the Skrulls lost their shape-shifting ability.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #14 (1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Empire falls into disarray, Kl'rt goes into hiding on Earth and later attacks the [[Fantastic Four]].

He escapes his imprisonment and resumes contact with the Skrull Empire. The Super-Skrull seeks to take [[Young Avengers]] member [[Hulkling]] into protective custody because he has Skrullian heritage on his mother's side as the son of [[Anelle|Princess Anelle]]. He impersonates the willing Hulkling (who wishes to remain on Earth) and returns to space able to spy on the Skrulls and the Kree, who also have a stake in Hulkling's mixed parentage since he is the son of Kree hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]].<ref>''Young Avengers'' #9-12 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]], Kl'rt tries to stop the destructive wave before it reaches the Skrull world, where his son was. After he is nearly overwhelmed by the forces of [[Annihilus]], he sacrifices himself by destroying the warship ''Harvester of Sorrow'', however unable to save his son.

While [[Amadeus Cho]]'s Hulk form was fighting the Warlord, Super-Skrull unearthed the [[Infinity Gems|Time Stone]] and plans to use it to restore the Skrull Empire to its former glory.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #713.

During the "[[Infinity Wars]]" storyline, [[Doctor Strange]] took the Time Stone from the Skrull sorcerer Mt'nox and used it to loop through time, creating multiple versions of himself to defeat Kl'rt.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Super-Skrull took part in the Kree/Skrull Alliance and was recruited by Tanalth the Pursuer to become part of Hulkling's inner circle. Though Hulkling did punch Super-Skrull for what he did to his mother. Super-Skrull states that the woman who raised him was Anelle's chambermaid and he has since regretted the action.<ref>''Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the persuasion of Tanalth the Pursuer, Super-Skrull talks about it stating that when a star builds up enough energy and detonates, the Pyre happens. Super-Skrull revealed that he had to use it on the Kral system where the Skrull colonies that imitated Earth's culture were wiped out during the Cotati's invasion much to the shock of Captain Marvel.<ref>''Empyre'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the Cotati's defeat, Hulkling makes Super-Skrull pay for what he did to his foster mother by making him live with his actions and transferring him to diplomatic services effective immediately.<ref>''Empyre: Aftermath Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his first diplomatic mission, Super-Skrull and his subaltern Val-Korr go into peace talks with [[Noh-Varr]] of the Kree, Nova of the Nova Corps, Lani Ko Ako of the [[Badoon]] Sisterhood, Nymbus Sternhoff of the Kymellians, Emperor Stote of the [[Zn'rx]] who went to the restroom, Mentacle of the [[Rigellians (comics)|Rigellians]], Oracle-2 of the [[Shi'ar]], Zoralis Gupa from the planet Silnius, Empress Victoria of Spartax, and Peacekeeper of the [[Chitauri]]. The representatives go into peace talks while bringing up the Pyre incident and Hulkling's marriage to Wiccan. Nova proposes that all pan-world treaties remain in force and all forbidden weaponry to be decommissioned which Empress Victoria supports. When Emperor Stote is found dead and Marvel Boy is a suspect after attacking Val-Korr, Nova calls in the Guardians of the Galaxy to investigate Emperor Stote's murder.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 6 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> After reviewing what had happened up to Emperor Stote's murder, Super-Skrull states that a Snarkwar has begun in the Zn'rx race to decide his successor and declines Oracle-2's suggestion of a mind-probe. When asked by Rocket Raccoon to shoot Noh-Varr in the head with Val-Korr's gun, he does and part of Super-Skrull's head gets shot off and regenerates. Rocket Raccoon states that the gun is a gene-scanner which kill anyone who uses it on a Kree and suspects that one of the representatives was responsible. He has the Proscenium's computer system initiate the voice override code 877-Delta for one hour, instructs Oracle-2 and Mentacle to scan the minds, has Moondragon scan Oracle-2 and Mentacle's minds at the same time. The scan goes on until it reaches the mind of Peacekeeper as he initiates a bio-bomb on his chest while stating that he was to bring peace to the enemies who despise hive-kind. As Hercules and Phyla-Vell restrain Peacekeeper, Nova and Noh-Varr work to disarm the bio-bomb as Rocket Raccoon figures out that Lani Ko Ako is the true culprit since the Badoon Sisterhood have never left their planet nor sent anyone to represent them. Lani Ko Ako deactivates her image inducer revealing that she is the Profiteer who interfered in the peace meeting since it would put her out of work of selling weapons to feuding sides. After Zoralis Gupa takes an urgent call while mentioning to the person on the other side to warn all neighboring systems, he tells Victoria that it is the End of Everything as different planets are starting to die in the planets owned by the Shi'ar, the Kree/Skrull Alliance, and the Zn'rx while rendering the galactic economy fragile enough to go bankrupt. Knowing that she will not make a profit, the Profiteer teleports Peacekeeper and the bio-bomb away. While thanking Zoralis Gupa for fooling the Profiteer with the bluff, Zoralis Gupa states to Super-Skrull and everyone present that something darker than Galactus is destroying the worlds and its name is [[Knull (character)|Knull]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 6 #8.

==Powers and abilities==
Kl'rt can shapeshift (like all Skrulls) but, thanks to his re-engineering by Skrull scientists, he has versions of the Fantastic Four's superpowers. These include greater malleability; superhuman strength, stamina and durability; flight, heat manipulation and energy projection (in the forms of plasma, concussive force and anti-matter blasts); invisibility and the creation of invisible force fields. He has developed his expertise over time. The Super-Skrull also has a unique power: the ability to control the minds of others or paralyze them by emitting hypnotic force from his eyes.

He is an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, expert in armed and unarmed combat and highly trained in the martial applications of his powers. A tactician, the Super-Skrull has detailed knowledge of (and access to) technology which is centuries ahead of Marvel Earth science. He is a competent starship pilot and a talented impersonator.

==Other Super-Skrulls==
Kl'rt is not the only Super-Skrull serving the Skrull Empire. They are immune to detection by Wolverine's senses, Doctor Strange's magic, Spider-Man's spider-sense, Professor X's telepathy, and Iron Man's technology due to the effects of the Skrull infiltration ritual. They are not immune to [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s magic at the time when they were derived from [[Dormammu]]. Known Super-Skrulls include:
