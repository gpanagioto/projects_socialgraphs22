 Get out of here. Get. Outta here!   What are you gonna do? No? What does that have to do with Passover? Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies. I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.  If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you! Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth! These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid. What are you doing? Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.  Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry. That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys! It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart! It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go. That's just how God is. This is what God told us to do! You'll see!  Yeah.  I know, you're not.
