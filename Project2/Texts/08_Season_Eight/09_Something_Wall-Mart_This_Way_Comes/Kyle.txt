That is fucking stupid, Cartman! Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish? Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie? You only need one copy, r-tard! Okay, fine, I will!  Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night.  Why, Mr. Farkle?  Cartman, stop it! See?! That sucks, dude! Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  What the hell?  Butters? What the hell are you doing? But you ''run'' the Wall-Mart. You hate Wall-Mart, too?  No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.  It wasn't ''my'' idea to burn the Wall-Mart down. Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the? How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here? Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?! But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here! Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all! No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart. Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha! I was working for Wall-Mart all along!" or something. All right, fine. Come on, fatass!   I heard that! You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart! He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding! God-damnit!  It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires! Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town. We want to talk to who's in charge. So how do we stop it? The heart of Wall-Mart? All right. C'mon you guys. We have to get back home.  All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it. I knew you were! Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this! Yes, I did! Yes, I did! Yes, I did! Yes. I did!   -and I told you that-  We've gotta find the television department.  I think I see the television department in the back! Who are you? Where's the heart? The question is, "Where is the heart?" The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out NOW!  All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back. Duh.
