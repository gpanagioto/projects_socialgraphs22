 Aaah, I don't know. Why? In my jeans?  ...Yeah. I do. Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel. You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?! Every time? Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup.  <poem><i>Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.</i></poem>  <poem><i>Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.</i></poem>  Shelly, that's enough time on your phone. You know we're all cutting down on phone time.  Oh really? A-About... about what? Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde. It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down. Yah, that's my cover. Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs. Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."</i></poem> Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Stan?  You wanted to see me, boss?  Hi Carol. Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined. I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music. With what?   It's okay, it's gluten free.
