Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and "Stinky Britches" by our artist, Alanis Morissette. I am above the law! Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you. Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business. And that chair, too. I want that chair. You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too. Take this, too. I can take whatever I want. I am above the law! I told you not to mess with me.  You wouldn’t. That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me! I am above the law! What are you bastards doing? Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this! We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts.
