Hello, everybody! You know, Jesus, there've been ''so'' many songs written about us over the years. <poem><i>And heaven and nature sing...</i></poem> <poem><i>And heaven and nature sing...</i></poem> <poem><i>Up on the housetop, click click click.<br />Down through the chimney with good old... me.</i></poem> Go away?? ''Where'' away? Here's one, <poem><i>Jol-</i></poem> Hey, it's my turn. Uh. <poem><i>Santa Cl- em</i></poem> <poem><i>Saint Nicholas... can't think of one.</i></poem> I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving.  Aw, fuck you, Jesus!  Aw. <poem><i> Well, since I've no place to go.</i></poem> <poem><i>But I brought some corn for poopity-poppin'.</i></poem> <poem><i>And, my dear, we're still good-bop-be-byein',</i></poem> 
I bring happiness and love to children all over the world. Christmas is for giving! 
 Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!  Mr. Hankey, how are you? I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me. Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end. You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation. Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run! And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room. Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!  Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all! Merry Christmas!  Hold on!   North Pole. This is Santa.  Where are you taking me??   To bring happiness and joy to the children. No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?! I don't know, I live in the North Pole.  What are you doing?? Oh no. Not Santa's balls!   I'm gonna fucking kill you! Then we're in for a long night, because I don't know shit!  Jesus Christ!  Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus!  Santa's legs are broken.  I just couldn't do it.   No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch. We sure did, Jesus.  I'm here, Jesus.  Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh!  You're right, kid.  I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it!  Hohoho! Merry Christmas!  Merry Christmas! Hohoho! Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!   Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day, we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus. Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do.   
 All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?! Little boy, you should be ashamed! Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters!  Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into. Don't do it, Kyle!   We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul. What? Well little boy, it seems that ''you''  have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year? 
What? What happened? Huh?  Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home. 
Sorry, boys. I tried.  That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear, and be willing to hurt people, and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence. 
 Ho ho ho ho!  I heard some people here might need a little Christmas magic. Well, that's no problem for the hometown of my favorite holiday poo! Where is Mr. Hankey?  Where is that old bundle of Christmas cheer?  Got rid of him? Jesus, what did he do? Fuck a kid?  Merry Christmas! Have fun sucking Jeff Bezos' dick, you bunch of cunts!  
 Did you know that the holidays are when the most DUIs and drinking-related accidents occur? Please, be sure to celebrate the holiday season responsibly, because last holiday season  The-, the most drunk-driving accidents than ever bef- Okay, okay, Come on. All Santa is saying is that drinking and driving during the holidays- Well, how about a little baby Yoda doll? What on earth??  What the-? How are people still drinking and driving?? Marijuana? This isn't what Santa meant! I got rid of liquor and now you assholes are all just getting high?! God-fucking-damnit!   Marijuana-free Christmas Snow? Do you realize that tomorrow is Christmas Eve?! Santa to base, come in. Sleigh is too loaded down to fly. Gonna have to take the roads until I can find a place to dump all this blow.  Oh shit!  Ho ho ho!  Stay back, mutherfucker! Oh, Santa understands plenty! You assholes drink and drive and you think marijuana is somehow different, go driving around on that, and then you go and make this shit! Oh, don't give Santa that! Coke is coke!  Santa's done coke before. Santa knows what- It's, it's cocaine. Just like every other cocaine Santa's ever tried. You people really think that the holidays are- Okay, yeah, that's pretty good. But it doesn't matter! Because Christmas is a- Wow, that is really clean. It's like not speedy at all. It's really mellow.  Honestly, I didn't think cocaine could be this pure, wow. No, you can tell. It's really clean. Santa likey.  Maybe I have been a little too old-fashioned in my thinking. Oh Jesus. Jesus, you really gotta try it. You cut out the middle man, nobody dies in South America, nobody dies from impurities . It's fucking pure. What are you doing, Jesus? It's more than okay. Tegridy cocaine is smooth and has a great finish.
