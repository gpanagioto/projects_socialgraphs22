Fine. You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something. Really? Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind! God damn it, that wasn't my idea! Hi. I've uh...   No, that... I thought that was a lot.  Oh crap.  I don't know. He did? Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night. Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There ''has'' to be another reason. I don't want you to jump them, retard! Oh my God. Holy shit, dude!  Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy. You barely made it over one, fatass! God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a- What's it doing?  What about you? We're nine. Shut up, Cartman! Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over ''one'' homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over ''that'' guy! You son of a bitch.  I knew it! It ''wasn't'' because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!  No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea. That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it! We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other! All right, hit it.
