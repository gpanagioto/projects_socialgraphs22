Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here. We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play? I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?  Hey, look at this!  It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.  Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan? Well.  Alrighty then. Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week? Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission. Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us? Oh, that's a splendid mission! Bosley! Bosley! Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels. Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs. So Bosley, what's our next mission? We did it! Great job, Angels! What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley? Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission? Oh dear. We've angered Bosley. Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits. Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission. But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again. Now what do we do?   I think that's got it. Did I do a nice job? Really? O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day!  There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
