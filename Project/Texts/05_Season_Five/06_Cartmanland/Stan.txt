"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez." "It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."  Yeah, awesome! ...Why? You'd better not be lying, Kenny.  Oh my God. Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket? Yeah, it's unbelievable. Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money.  Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle? Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but-- Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.  Oh, hey, dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start. What's that? Heh, heh.  Sorry. Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.  That does it, dude! We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not!  Come on, dude! Aw, crap. Dude!  Alright, let's go. You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better! You'll see! We'll get in!  Dude, are you okay? Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in. Jesus. Goddamnit Cartman, let me in! It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole! AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman! Kyle, you gotta see!!  Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached? Then damnit man, do it! Look, Kyle. Look.  Kyle! Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
