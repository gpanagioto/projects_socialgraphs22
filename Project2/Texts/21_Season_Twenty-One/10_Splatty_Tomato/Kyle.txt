Ike... Ike, I'm sorry that I caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on Canada. I was just- you know, I was just trying to get shows that were toxic taken down. You know, those shows can be really harmful. [Him and Stan walk up with their bikes] What's going on? Who did? You saw the President? It's my fault. Ike went to go take matters into his own hands. I have to find him. I don't need anyone to go with me. I would never have the hots for the person you are now. We need to keep going guys. Ike! Ike? Can we go please?! Here it is. [Opens the door] Ike? He's not here either. You don't understand Canadians. They're fiercely loyal to their country. When Canada is attacked, they all join in the fight. Oh, my God! Look! These are Ike's toy binoculars! He was here! Ike!
