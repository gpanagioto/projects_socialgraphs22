==Publication history==
[[Stan Lee]] chose the name "the Abomination", which he realized belonged to no other character, before conceiving the character's background and appearance. Lee recalled that he simply told the artist [[Gil Kane]] to "make him bigger and stronger than the [[Hulk]] and we'll have a lot of fun with him."<ref>{{Cite news|author=Tim Lammers |title=Stan Lee Pumped Over Return Of 'Incredible Hulk' |work=[[KCRA-TV]] |date=2008-06-11 |url=http://www.kcra.com/entertainment/16574962/detail.html |access-date=2008-06-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013230843/http://www.kcra.com/entertainment/16574962/detail.html |archive-date=2008-10-13 }}</ref>

Emil Blonsky first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', and was introduced as a [[KGB]] agent and spy<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=8}}</ref> who became the Abomination after deliberately exposing himself to a greater quantity of the same gamma radiation that transformed Bruce Banner into his [[alter ego]] the Hulk, using a machine Banner was planning on using to commit suicide. In his first appearance, Blonsky became a large scaly humanoid even stronger than the Hulk.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=185}}</ref> In accordance with Lee's wishes, the character defeated the Hulk in their first battle.<ref name="Astonish' 1967">''Tales to Astonish'' #90–91 (April–May 1967).

==Fictional character biography==
Emil Blonsky was born in [[Zagreb]] (now the capital and largest city of [[Croatia]], then part of [[Yugoslavia]]) and became a [[KGB]] agent who infiltrated an Air Force Base in New Mexico where Dr. Bruce Banner was attempting to kill the Hulk through overexposure to gamma rays. Blonsky triggers Banner turning into the Hulk, subsequently becoming a hideous lizard-like creature himself.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #89 (April 1967). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =[[The Encyclopedia of Super-Villains]] |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=1}}</ref>

The Abomination reappears when summoned by a [[coven]] of [[witches]] to briefly battle the cosmic hero the [[Silver Surfer]]<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #12 (Jan. 1970). Marvel Comics.</ref> and summons [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] (via an absent Stranger's technology) to aid him in escaping the Stranger's laboratory world. Thor frees the Abomination and the other captives, but, on discovering they are all evil, uses his mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] to [[time travel]] several hours into the past to undo his mistake. After defeating the Abomination and placing the Abomination in prison, Thor departs.<ref name="Thor  #178 July 1970"/> When the Hulk is defeated by the alien Xeron the Star Slayer and brought aboard a space vessel, the Abomination is revealed to be [[Chief mate|First Mate]] of the alien crew. When the captain of the vessel directs Xeron and the crew to battle a creature in space, the Hulk and the Abomination are thrown from the vessel and battle until the pair are drawn into Earth's [[orbit]] and separated.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #136–137 (March–April 1971). Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that the Abomination entered into a [[coma]]-like state upon impacting with Earth and is buried for two years. Revived by an off-course [[missile]] fired from [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] Base (under Ross's jurisdiction), the Abomination joins forces with General Ross to defeat the Hulk, but is battered into submission by an angered Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #159 (Jan. 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Abomination reappears with fellow Hulk foe the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], and the pair activates a gamma bomb at the Hulkbuster base in an attempt to destroy the Hulk. The Hulk's companion of the time, [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]], deactivates the bomb and the Hulk tricks the villains during combat, forcing them to collide and knock each other [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #171 (Jan. 1974). Marvel Comics.</ref> A comatose Abomination is eventually found by soldiers at Ross's direction and has a miniature bomb implanted in his [[Human skull|skull]], being told to fight and defeat the Hulk or be killed. The Abomination tricks the Hulk into an alliance and betrays Ross by attempting to [[ransom]] the captured [[Kennedy Space Center]]. The plan fails when the Hulk turns on the Abomination and the pair fight, with the Abomination being caught on a [[rocket]] when it explodes.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #194–196 (Dec. 1975–Feb. 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

An [[illusion]] of the Abomination also appears with illusions of other Hulk foes when the Hulk (at the time possessing the intelligence of Banner, thanks to being made to a device called the Encephalo-Helmet) enters the [[brain]] of [[Colonel]] [[Glenn Talbot]] at [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] size to excise a [[mental block]] placed in Talbot's mind by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #200 (June 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Abomination eventually reappears as a servant of the alien entity the [[Galaxy Master]], having been empowered with even greater strength. After another extended battle with the Hulk, the Hulk attacks and destroys the Galaxy Master, causing the Abomination to weaken and apparently become lost in [[Outer space|space]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #270 (April 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[MODOK]] invades Hulkbuster Base, he colludes with General Ross to revive the Abomination, who was found in a block of ice above Earth and kept in [[cryogenic]] storage for further study. MODOK intends to use the Abomination against his superiors at [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], while Ross wants to use him to destroy the Hulk. The Abomination, however, has become afraid of the Hulk as a result of their past battles and has to be mentally forced by MODOK to even ''fight'' the Hulk. MODOK, however, is ousted by A.I.M., and a hesitant Abomination is beaten by the Hulk when he intervenes to save Banner's laboratory assistant. The Abomination refuses to rejoin the fight, and is disintegrated by MODOK.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #287–290 (Sept.–Nov. 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' storyline, the Abomination is restored by the demon-lord [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]], who directs the Abomination and other villains against the cosmic entity the [[Beyonder]] as a member of the Legion Accursed.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #1–9 (July 1985–March 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The restoration is temporary, as a still-disembodied Abomination's atoms mingle with the disembodied atoms of the villain [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]], who reintegrates the Abomination's body and places it under his mind's control. Tyrannus, as the Abomination, then comes into conflict with the Gray Hulk, and quickly defeats the weaker version of their foe. When the Hulk reverts to Banner, Tyrannus forces him to create a procedure that will remove Blonsky's mind, who is mentally fighting Tyrannus' mind for control of the Abomination's body. The process is successful and Blonksy is restored to his human form, free of Tyrannus, whose mind is still occupying the form of the Abomination. An enraged Gray Hulk defeats Tyrannus, who is placed into custody by the organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 Annual #15 (Jan. 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After encounters against [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[Wonder Man]]<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #25 (Oct. 1987).

Marvel Comics.</ref> the Tyrannus-controlled Abomination reappears during the "[[Atlantis Attacks]]" storyline with the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Ghaur]] freeing Tyrannus from the body of the Abomination by restoring Tyrannus' mind to a duplicate of his own body and placing Blonsky's mind within the Abomination's body once more. The process drives Blonksy insane, and he battles heroes [[Spider-Man]] and the [[She-Hulk]], managing to knock both unconscious. The Abomination is eventually driven off when set on fire by the She-Hulk.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #23 (1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Abomination's mental faculties eventually return and the Abomination reappears in the "Countdown" storyline as a pawn of another Hulk foe, the [[Leader (character)|Leader]]. The Abomination is sent to a [[toxic waste]] site to collect samples and encounters the gray version of the Hulk again, who is outmatched and also weak due to being [[poison]]ed. The Hulk, however, throws the Abomination into toxic waste that partially dissolves and horribly scars the Abomination.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #364–367 (Dec. 1989–March 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Abomination temporarily teams with villains [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]] and [[Gargantua (comics)|Gargantua]]<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Annual #19 (Jan. 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> and finds and stalks his former wife, Nadia (a famous [[ballet]] dancer). The Abomination captures her and after taking her into the New York City sewers, reveals his true identity. After a brief skirmish, the Hulk persuades the Abomination to free his wife.<ref name="Hulk' 1991"/>

The Abomination is also captured by the [[robot]] [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]s, but is eventually freed by the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 2 #6–8 (July, Oct. and Dec. 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Marvel Comics.</ref> The Abomination retaliates against the [[NYPD]] when the [[Police Commissioner]] orders the sewers be cleared of all homeless, who the Abomination has placed under his protection. After killing several police officers, he is eventually driven away when confronted by the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #431–432 (July–Aug. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Abomination battles the mutant [[Nate Grey]] (who is searching the sewers for his lover and fellow mutant [[Threnody]], who had been one of the homeless followers of the Abomination), who uses his mental abilities to trick the Abomination in thinking that he defeated Grey.<ref>''X-Man'' vol. 2 #19–20 (Sept.–Oct. 1996). Marvel Comics.</ref> He battles a [[delusion]]al Hulk<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #459 (Dec. 1997).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

When [[Betty Ross]] dies in the title ''Hulk'', Banner mistakenly thinks her proximity to the Hulk has induced a fatal case of [[radiation poisoning]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #468 (Sept. 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> Using a gamma device, a vindictive General Ross tracks what he believes to be the Hulk to a destroyed town, where the Abomination reveals he was the true culprit.

The circumstances of Betty's death are eventually revealed: Blonksy's transformation into the Abomination apparently alienates his former wife Nadia, driving his hatred of Banner; Blonsky, deciding to deprive Banner of Betty in return, secretly [[poison]]s her with his radioactive blood. After hearing the Abomination's admission, Banner eventually discovers the truth and the Hulk defeats the Abomination in combat. Taken into custody by the military, Blonsky is forced to watch old [[home movie]]s of him and his wife together (prior to his transformation) as punishment.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #24–25 (March–April 2001).

The Abomination reappears after the events of ''World War Hulk'', encountering a new foe called the [[Red Hulk]]. This new opponent savagely beats, shoots, and kills the Abomination.<ref name="Hulk' 2008"/> Later on, it is revealed that the Abomination's killer, the Red Hulk, is actually General Ross's gamma-powered alter ego; he killed Blonsky as an act of revenge for his deliberate gamma poisoning (and later death) of Ross's daughter Betty.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #23.

Marvel Comics</ref> bent on gaining control of the Hulk harvests biological material from a mortally wounded Bruce Banner. After Banner regains consciousness following the experiment and escapes as the Hulk, the organization uses this material to resurrect the Abomination under their control, leaving him "free of a mind or a conscience" and with an ability to seek out Banner/the Hulk for retrieval.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #1–2 (April–May 2014).

Tissue samples of the Abomination were later used by the U.S. Hulk Operations to graft to the corpse of Rick Jones that revives him as an Abomination/A-Bomb-like creature that Dr. Charlene McGowan calls Subject B.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After ripping Rick Jones from Subject B's body in a brutal battle, Hulk Operations Commanding Officer General Reginald Fortean teleports to Gamma Flight Headquarters in space, killing Sasquatch and temporarily killing Doctor Samson to retrieve the Subject B husk. Fortean then willingly fuses himself with the body.<ref>''The Immortal Hulk'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Devil's Reign]]" storyline, Abomination appears as a member of the Thunderbolts and shows up to stop Jessica Jones and the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] from interfering in the Thunderbolts' apprehension of most of the Purple Children. As Jessica notes that Abomination would not normally be someone to work for Mayor [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]], Abomination states that Mayor Fisk has the information that he seeks.<ref>''Devil's Reign'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> The recruitment of Abomination was the result of [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] leaving the group as he crossed the line of hunting children.<ref>''Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Abomination is similar to the Hulk in terms of strength, stamina, speed, and durability, including his healing factor. In contrast with the Hulk, he retains his intellect after transforming, and cannot change back into human form. He also possesses [[gills]], enabling him to breathe underwater. Due to extreme pain, cold, or bereft of [[oxygen]], he could enter into suspended animation for long periods. Initially, the Abomination is twice as strong as the Hulk, but unlike the Hulk, his strength does not increase/decrease in proportion to level of rage, with result that the Hulk is able to gain an advantage over the Abomination if the fight takes a sufficient amount of time for him to unleash his anger.

After being empowered by Amatsu-Mikaboshi, an [[undead]] Abomination is considerably larger than before. Formerly, he could project hellfire and was strong enough to rip an armored shell off of his successor [[Rick Jones (character)#Becoming A-Bomb|A-Bomb]] (something that even the Red Hulk had previously been unable to do).<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #618–619. Marvel Comics. Marvel Comics.</ref> After his second resurrection by this Illuminati-dubbed Order of the Shield, a cloned Abomination gains more augmentation through Banner's biological grafts. Currently, he has the ability to track down the Hulk anywhere at will.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #2 (May 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> Another feature for him is also to manipulate his own gamma ray output in such a way that he can make it toxic and overwhelm the most resilient of individuals, including energy absorbers such as the Hulk, [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Sunspot (Marvel Comics)|Sunspot]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #4 (July 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>
