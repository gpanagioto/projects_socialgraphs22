'''Alexander Bont''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]], appearing in the series ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''. He was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Alex Maleev]], first appearing in ''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #66 (Dec. 2004). He was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] into being the '''Kingpin of Crime''' before [[Wilson Fisk]]. His story was told via flashbacks, which were drawn to resemble artwork from the [[Silver Age of comic books]]. The climax of ''Daredevil'' Vol. 2, #65 (Nov. 2004) alluded to Murdock having been Bont's attorney at one time. This plot thread was dropped however as it was revealed in later issues that Matt refused to be his lawyer.

A female version of Bont, primarily known as '''Alexandra''', is portrayed by [[Sigourney Weaver]] in the 2017 [[miniseries]] [[The Defenders (miniseries)|''The Defenders'']], a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] between [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's Netflix series]] set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), depicted as one of the five "fingers" of [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]] and its leader.

==Fictional character biography==
===The First Kingpin===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:youngbont.JPG|thumb|left|A younger Alexander Bont.]] -->Alexander Bont first made a name for himself when he killed the hero known as the Defender.<ref name="Daredevil vol. 2, #67">Daredevil vol. 2, #67</ref> After that, he soon rose up the ranks and became the head of organized crime.

The Fixer, the man who ordered the hit on Jack Murdock, paid up to Bont. When Daredevil found this out, he confronted Bont and got him arrested.<ref name="Daredevil vol. 2, #67"/> Bont got out on bail. He later asked Matt Murdock for legal help, but was refused.

When he got out, he paid a visit to the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]] who had worked for Bont in the past. He ordered Potter to kill Daredevil. "I made my rep on the blood of one masked mystery man...I'm not--I am ''not'' going to lose it over another one."

The Gladiator attacked Daredevil, but was defeated. Daredevil found out that Bont had hired him, and told Bont that he'd see him in jail for this.

Bont was found guilty and sent to prison. The last thing he saw before being loaded into the bus was Daredevil perched on top of a nearby building, smirking at him.

===Bont's Revenge===
When Bont was released from jail, he was now a bitter old man. He had found out that Daredevil was really Matt Murdock from ''The Globe'' and had acquired a possession of Mutant Growth Hormone.<ref>Daredevil vol. 2, #69</ref>

The world had changed a lot in his absence. Places had changed and his beloved wife died while he was imprisoned. Furious, Bont set out to get revenge on Daredevil.

He met up with Melvin Potter again, who refused to work with him. Bont threatened him with the death of his daughter. "I've arranged for the murder of your four-year-old daughter. She's never ''met'' you, but she'll die ''because'' of you. ''You'' do what ''I'' say."

Potter kidnapped Matt Murdock, and was forced to beat him while Bont videotaped it. He then dragged Matt out (in his Daredevil costume) to show the public. When the new [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]] arrived on the scene and defeated Melvin Potter, Bont took some MGH and threw Matt into a window, savagely beating him and telling him that this was where his father was killed.

However, the action, coupled with the overdose of MGH, proved to be too much for Bont. His heart exploded, killing him.<ref>Daredevil vol. 2, #70</ref>

Thousands of years before the events of the series, the elders of [[K'un-Lun]] came together to study the healing powers of ''[[qi]]''. After five among their number to use this power to become [[Immortality|immortal]] by sacrificing a [[dragon]], they are cast out, becoming the five "fingers" of the [[secret organization]] [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]], led by a woman known as Alexandra in modern times, alongside Madame Gao, Sowande, Murakami, and [[Bakuto (comics)|Bakuto]]. In the series, the Hand having defeated all that oppose them except for [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] (events depicted during the events of [[Daredevil (TV series)|''Daredevil'']]) and the [[Iron Fist (comics)|Immortal Iron Fist]] (events depicted during the events of [[Iron Fist (TV series)|''Iron Fist'']]). In modern times, with their immortality waning, Alexandra seeks to tunnel to dragon bones buried behind a mystical door beneath [[New York City]] to renew it, the process of which destroying will result in a series of [[earthquake]]s decimating the city, leading her to become opposed by [[Defenders (comics)|the Defenders]]. Following the death of [[Elektra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Elektra]], Alexandra resurrects her body with the last of their resources to bring the ancient weapon known as Black Sky into existence, prophesied to destroy all enemies of the Hand, seeking to use her to steal the Iron Fist from [[Danny Rand (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Danny Rand]]. Criticized by the other "fingers" Under Alexandra's tutelage, Murakami questions Alexandra's reliance on the Black Sky suggests that they devise a new plan without Alexandra. After Sowande is killed by Stick, the other Hand leaders continue losing faith in Alexandra, as Elektra begins to regain memories of her previous life, before killing Stick on Alexandra's orders. As Alexandra gloats to the other leaders about this victory, she is killed herself by Elektra (after attempting to order [[Matt Murdock (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Matt Murdock]] killed, whom Elektra had been romantically involved with in her original life), who claims leadership of the Hand.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=July 21, 2017|title=Elektra and Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra will have a strange relationship in ''The Defenders''|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/7/21/16013584/defenders-elektra-alexandra|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723065322/https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/7/21/16013584/defenders-elektra-alexandra|archive-date=July 23, 2017|access-date=July 21, 2017|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>
