'''Superman''' is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; superheroes (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[superhero]] who appears in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], and debuted in the comic book ''[[Action Comics]]'' [[Action Comics 1|#1]] ([[cover-date]]d June 1938 and published April 18, 1938).<ref name=actioncomics1copyright>The copyright date of ''[[Action Comics]]'' [[Action Comics 1|#1]] was registered as April 18, 1938.<br />See {{cite book|url= https://archive.org/stream/catalogofcopyrig332lib#page/n141/mode/2up|title= Catalog of Copyright Entries.

Superman was born on the fictional planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] and was named '''Kal-El'''. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]]. He was found and adopted by farmers [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], who named him '''Clark Kent'''. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where he works as a journalist for the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Superman's [[List of Superman supporting characters|supporting characters]] include his [[Superman and Lois Lane|love interest]] and fellow journalist [[Lois Lane]], ''Daily Planet'' photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]] and editor-in-chief [[Perry White]], and his [[List of Superman enemies|enemies]] include [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], [[General Zod]], [[Darkseid]], and his archenemy [[Lex Luthor]].

Superman is the archetype of the [[superhero]]: he wears an outlandish costume, uses a codename, and fights evil with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier characters who arguably fit this definition, it was Superman who popularized the superhero genre and established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books up until the 1980s.<ref name=DallasEtAl2013p208>[[#refDallasEtAl2013|Dallas et al.

[[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] met in 1932 while attending [[Glenville High School]] in [[Cleveland]] and bonded over their admiration of fiction. Siegel aspired to become a writer and Shuster aspired to become an illustrator. Siegel wrote amateur [[science fiction]] stories, which he self-published as a magazine called ''Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization''. His friend Shuster often provided illustrations for his work.<ref name=Ricca2014/> In January 1933, Siegel published a short story in his magazine titled "[[The Reign of the Superman]]". The titular character is a homeless man named Bill Dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental drug. The drug gives Dunn the powers of mind-reading, mind-control, and clairvoyance. He uses these powers maliciously for profit and amusement, but then the drug wears off, leaving him a powerless vagrant again. Shuster provided illustrations, depicting Dunn as a bald man.<ref>Jerry Siegel (under the pseudonym Herbert S. Fine). "The Reign of the Superman". ''Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization'' #3. January 1933<br />Summarized in [[#refRicca2014|Ricca (2014), ''Super Boys'', p. pp. 70–72]].</ref>

Siegel and Shuster shifted to making [[comic strip]]s, with a focus on adventure and comedy. They wanted to become syndicated newspaper strip authors, so they showed their ideas to various newspaper editors. However, the newspaper editors told them that their ideas were insufficiently sensational. If they wanted to make a successful comic strip, it had to be something more sensational than anything else on the market. This prompted Siegel to revisit Superman as a comic strip character.<ref>Jerry Siegel, quoted in {{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 15: "When we presented different strips to the syndicate editors, they would say, 'Well, this isn't sensational enough.' So I thought, I'm going to come up with something so wild they won't be able to say that."</ref><ref>Jerry Siegel. ''Creation of a Superhero'' (unpublished memoir, written c.1978; Scans available from [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k3rb8by5oupsjhz/Creation%20of%20a%20Superhero%20by%20Jerry%20Siegel.pdf?dl=0 Dropbox] and [https://www.scribd.com/document/382800890/Creation-of-a-Superhero-by-Jerry-Siegel Scribd]{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).:<br />"...one of the things which spurred me into creating a "Superman" strip was something a syndicate editor said to me after I had been submitting various proposed comic strips to him. "The trouble with your stuff is that it isn't spectacular enough," he said. "You've got to come up with something sensational! Something more terrific than the other adventure strips on the market!""</ref> Siegel modified Superman's powers to make him even more sensational: Like Bill Dunn, the second prototype of Superman is given powers against his will by an unscrupulous scientist, but instead of psychic abilities, he acquires [[superhuman strength]] and [[Invulnerability|bullet-proof skin]].<ref>[[#refTye2012|Tye (2012), ''Superman'', p. 17]]: "The version he was drafting would again begin with a wild scientist empowering a normal human against his will, but this time the powers would be even more fantastic, and rather than becoming a criminal, the super-being would fight crime "with the fury of an outraged avenger.""</ref><ref>Jerry Siegel. ''Creation of a Superhero'' (unpublished memoir, written c.1978; Scans available from [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k3rb8by5oupsjhz/Creation%20of%20a%20Superhero%20by%20Jerry%20Siegel.pdf?dl=0 Dropbox] and [https://www.scribd.com/document/382800890/Creation-of-a-Superhero-by-Jerry-Siegel Scribd]{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).:<br />p. 30: "The hero of 'THE SUPERMAN' comic book strip was also given super-powers against his will by a scientist. He gained fantastic strength, bullets bounced off him, etc. He fought crime with the fury of an outraged avenger."<br />50: "What, I thought, could be more sensational than a Superman who could fly through the air, who was impervious to flames, bullets, and a mob of enraged amok adversaries?"</ref> Additionally, this new Superman was a crime-fighting hero instead of a villain, because Siegel noted that comic strips with heroic protagonists tended to be more successful.<ref>Siegel in {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}, p. 10: "Obviously, having him a hero would be infinitely more commercial than having him a villain.  I understand that the comic strip Dr. Fu Manchu ran into all sorts of difficulties because the main character was a villain.  And with the example before us of Tarzan and other action heroes of fiction who were very successful, mainly because people admired them and looked up to them, it seemed the sensible thing to do to make The Superman a hero.  The first piece was a short story, and that's one thing, but creating a successful comic strip with a character you'll hope will continue for many years, it would definitely be going in the wrong direction to make him a villain."</ref> In later years, Siegel once recalled that this Superman wore a "bat-like" cape in some panels, but typically he and Shuster agreed there was no costume yet, and there is none apparent in the surviving artwork.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 17: "... usually [Shuster] and Siegel agreed that no special costume was in evidence, and the surviving artwork bears them out."</ref><ref>Siegel and Shuster in {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}, p.9-10: "Shuster: [...] It wasn't really Superman: that was before he evolved into a costumed figure. He was simply wearing a T-shirt and pants; he was more like Slam Bradley than anything else — just a man of action. [...]<br />Siegel: In later years – maybe 10 or 15 years ago – I asked Joe what he remembered of this story, and he remembered a scene of a character crouched on the edge of a building, with a cape almost a la Batman.  We don't specifically recall if the character had a costume or not. [...] Joe and I – especially Joe – seem to recall that there were some scenes in there in which that character had a bat-like cape."</ref>

Siegel and Shuster showed this second concept of Superman to Consolidated Book Publishers, based in Chicago.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 17</ref>{{efn|Consolidated Book Publishers was also known as Humor Publishing. Jerry Siegel always referred to this publisher as "Consolidated" in all interviews and memoirs. Humor Publishing was possibly a subsidiary of Consolidated.}} In May 1933, Consolidated had published a proto-comic book titled [[Dan Dunn|''Detective Dan: Secret Operative 48'']].<ref name=comicbookdate>The copyright date of ''Detective Dan Secret Operative 48'' was registered as May 12, 1933.<br />See {{cite book|url= https://archive.org/stream/catalogofcopyri301libr#page/351|title= Catalog of Copyright Entries.

''Superman on Film, Television, Radio and Broadway'', p. 6: "''Detective Dan—Secret Operative 48'' was published by the Humor Publishing Company of Chicago. Detective Dan was little more than a Dick Tracy clone, but here, for the first time, in a series of black-and-white illustrations, was a comic magazine with an original character appearing in all-new stories. This was a dramatic departure from other comic magazines, which simply reprinted panels from the Sunday newspaper comic strips."</ref> Siegel and Shuster put together a comic book in a similar format called ''The Superman''. A delegation from Consolidated visited Cleveland that summer on a business trip and Siegel and Shuster took the opportunity to present their work in person.<ref>Jerry Siegel. ''Creation of a Superhero'' (unpublished memoir, written c.1978; Scans available from [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k3rb8by5oupsjhz/Creation%20of%20a%20Superhero%20by%20Jerry%20Siegel.pdf?dl=0 Dropbox] and [https://www.scribd.com/document/382800890/Creation-of-a-Superhero-by-Jerry-Siegel Scribd]{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}):<br />"I do recall, though, that when Mr. Livingston visited Cleveland, Joe and I showed 'THE SUPERMAN' comic book pages to Mr. Livingston in his hotel room, and he was favorably impressed."</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Beerbohm |first=Robert |date=1996 |title=Siegel & Shuster Presents...

[[File:Siegel Shuster Superman 1933 concept.png|thumb|Cover of an unpublished comic book, 1933]]
Siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and Shuster were young and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster.<ref name=riccap99>[[#refRicca2014|Ricca (2014), ''Super Boys'', p. 99]]: "Jerry was convinced, just as he was in those early pulp days, that you had to align yourself with someone famous to be famous yourself. [...] Over the next year, Jerry contacted several major artists, including Mel Graff, J. Allen St. John, and even Bernie Schmittke [...]"</ref> When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover. They continued collaborating on other projects, but for the time being Shuster was through with Superman.<ref>[[#refTye2012|Tye (2012), ''Superman'', p. 18]]: "When I told Joe of this, he unhappily destroyed the drawn-up pages of 'THE SUPERMAN' burning them in the furnace of his apartment building. At my request, he gave me as a gift the torn cover. We continued collaborating on other projects."<br />In an interview with {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}, Shuster said he destroyed their 1933 Superman comic as a reaction to Humor Publishing's rejection letter, which contradicts Siegel's account in Siegel's unpublished memoir. [[#refTye2012|Tye (2012)]] argues that the account from the memoir is the truth and that Shuster lied in the interview to avoid tension.<br />See also ''Creation of a Superhero'' (unpublished memoir by Jerry Siegel, written c.1978; Scans available from [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k3rb8by5oupsjhz/Creation%20of%20a%20Superhero%20by%20Jerry%20Siegel.pdf?dl=0 Dropbox] and [https://www.scribd.com/document/382800890/Creation-of-a-Superhero-by-Jerry-Siegel Scribd]{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).</ref>

Siegel wrote to numerous artists.<ref name=riccap99/> The first response came in July 1933 from Leo O'Mealia, who drew the ''[[Fu Manchu]]'' strip for the [[Bell Syndicate]].<ref>[[#refTye2012|Tye (2012), ''Superman'', p. 18]]:"Next on the list was Leo O’Mealia, who drew the ''Fu Manchu'' comic and soon found in his mailbox Jerry's more fully developed script for Superman."</ref><ref>Jerry Siegel.

Just before the Earth explodes, he escapes in a time-machine to the modern era, whereupon he immediately begins using his superpowers to fight crime.<ref>[[#refTye2012|Tye (2012), ''Superman'', p. 18]]</ref> O'Mealia produced a few strips and showed them to his newspaper syndicate, but they were rejected. O'Mealia did not send to Siegel any copies of his strips, and they have been lost.<ref>Jerry Siegel.

In June 1934, Siegel found another partner: an artist in Chicago named Russell Keaton.<ref>Jerry Siegel.

[...] Russell Keaton's letter to me of June 14, 1934, was very enthusiastic.  He stated that in his opinion "Superman" was already a tremendous hit and that he would be glad to collaborate with me on "Superman"."</ref><ref name=jonesp112-113>{{harvp|Jones|2004}}. ''Men of Tomorrow'', p. 112-113</ref> Keaton drew the ''[[Buck Rogers (comic strip)|Buck Rogers]]'' and ''[[Skyroads (comics)|Skyroads]]'' comic strips. In the script that Siegel sent Keaton in June, Superman's origin story further evolved: In the distant future, when Earth is on the verge of exploding due to "giant cataclysms", the last surviving man sends his three-year-old son back in time to the year 1935. The time-machine appears on a road where it is discovered by motorists Sam and Molly Kent. They leave the boy in an orphanage, but the staff struggle to control him because he has superhuman strength and impenetrable skin. The Kents adopt the boy and name him Clark, and teach him that he must use his fantastic natural gifts for the benefit of humanity. In November, Siegel sent Keaton an extension of his script: an adventure where Superman foils a conspiracy to kidnap a star [[American football|football]] player. The extended script mentions that Clark puts on a special "uniform" when assuming the identity of Superman, but it is not described.<ref>[[#refRicca2014|Ricca (2014), ''Super Boys'', p. 101-102]]<br />Excerpts of Siegel and Keaton's collaboration can be found in Exhibit A (Docket 373–3), Exhibit C (Docket 347–2), Exhibit D (Docket 347–2), and Exhibit E (Docket 347–2) in ''Laura Siegel Larson v Warner Bros.

He wrote that he was completely withdrawing from any participation at all in the "Superman" comic strip and that as far as he was concerned: "the book is closed".

Siegel and Shuster reconciled and resumed developing Superman together. The character became an alien from the planet Krypton. Shuster designed the now-familiar costume: tights with an "S" on the chest, over-shorts, and a cape.<ref>Interview with Joe Shuster by Bertil Falk in 1975, quoted in ''Alter Ego'' #56 (Feb 2006):<br />"SHUSTER: [...] I conceived the character in my mind's eye to have a very, very colorful costume of a cape and, you know, very, very colorful tights and boots and the letter "S" on his chest.<br />FALK: You did that, not Siegel?<br />SHUSTER: Yes, yes.

''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 18</ref><ref>Over the years, Siegel and Shuster made contradictory statements regarding when they developed Superman's familiar costume. They occasionally claimed to have developed it immediately in 1933. {{harvp|Daniels|1998}} writes: "... usually [Shuster] and Siegel agreed that no special costume was in evidence [in 1933], and the surviving artwork bears them out." The cover art for their 1933 proposal to Humor Publishing shows a shirtless, cape-less Superman. Siegel's collaboration with Russell Keaton in 1934 contains no description nor illustration of Superman in costume. [[#refTye2012|Tye (2012)]] writes that Siegel and Shuster developed the costume shortly after they resumed working together in late 1934.</ref> They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and conceived his colleague [[Lois Lane]], who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman but does not realize that he and Kent are the same person.<ref>Siegel's unpublished memoir, [https://www.scribd.com/document/322254278/The-Story-Behind-Superman ''The Story Behind Superman''] ({{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913103321/https://www.scribd.com/document/322254278/The-Story-Behind-Superman |date=September 13, 2016 }}), as well as an interview with Thomas Andrae in ''Nemo'' #2 (1983), corroborate each other that Clark Kent's timid-journalist persona and Lois Lane were developed in 1934.</ref>

In June 1935 Siegel and Shuster finally found work with National Allied Publications, a comic magazine publishing company in New York owned by [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]].<ref>Wheeler-Nicholson offered Siegel and Shuster work in a letter dated June 6, 1935.

Wheeler-Nicholson's financial difficulties continued to mount.

Siegel and Shuster produced stories for ''Detective Comics'' too, such as "[[Slam Bradley]]".

=== Influences ===
Siegel and Shuster read [[Pulp magazine|pulp science-fiction and adventure magazines]], and many stories featured characters with fantastical abilities such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and superhuman strength. One character in particular was [[John Carter of Mars]] from the novels by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]. John Carter is a human who is transported to Mars, where the lower gravity makes him stronger than the natives and allows him to leap great distances.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "...when I did the version in 1934, (which years later, in 1938, was published, in revised form, in Action Comics #1) the John Carter stories did influence me. Carter was able to leap great distances because the planet Mars was smaller that [sic] the planet Earth; and he had great strength. I visualized the planet Krypton as a huge planet, much larger than Earth; so whoever came to Earth from that planet would be able to leap great distances and lift great weights."</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/the-history-behind-supermans-ever-changing-superpowers-1684736603|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326231729/http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-history-behind-supermans-ever-changing-superpowers-1684736603|url-status=dead|title=The History Behind Superman's Ever-Changing Superpowers|archivedate=March 26, 2017|website=Gizmodo}}</ref> Another influence was [[Philip Wylie]]'s 1930 novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'', featuring a protagonist named [[Hugo Danner]] who had similar powers.<ref>Jerry Siegel.

Superman's stance and devil-may-care attitude were influenced by the characters of [[Douglas Fairbanks]], who starred in adventure films such as ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "... I was inspired by the movies.  In the silent films, my hero was Douglas Fairbanks Senior, who was very agile and athletic.  So I think he might have been an inspiration to us, even in his attitude.  He had a stance which I often used in drawing Superman. You'll see in many of his roles—including Robin Hood—that he always stood with his hands on his hips and his feet spread apart, laughing—taking nothing seriously."</ref> The name of Superman's home city, Metropolis, was taken from the [[Metropolis (1927 film)|1927 film of the same name]].<ref name=Andrae1983>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}</ref> [[Popeye]] cartoons were also an influence.<ref name="Andrae1983"/>

The name "Clark Kent" was created by taking the first names of actors Clark Gable and Kent Taylor. "Clark" was also inspired by explorer William Clark especially when coming up with the names "Lois and Clark" a nod to the 19th-century American explorers [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]].{{cn|date=September 2022}}

Clark Kent's harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as Don Diego de la Vega in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' and Sir Percy Blakeney in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]''. Siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor.<ref>Jerry Siegel, quoted in {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "I loved ''The Mark of Zorro'', and I'm sure that had some influence on me.

In addition, it would, in a comic strip, permit some humorous characterization."</ref> Another inspiration was slapstick comedian [[Harold Lloyd]]. The archetypal Lloyd character was a mild-mannered man who finds himself abused by bullies but later in the story snaps and fights back furiously.<ref>Siegel: "We especially loved some of those movies in which Harold Lloyd would start off as a sort of momma's boy being pushed around, kicked around, thrown around, and then suddenly would turn into a fighting whirlwind."<br />Shuster: "I was kind of mild-manned and wore glasses so I really identified with it"<br />{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUrFYU2e_I |title=Superman – The Comic Strip Hero |publisher=BBC |people=Anthony Wall |medium=Television production |date=1981 |time=00:04:50 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228030413/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUrFYU2e_I |archive-date=December 28, 2015 }}</ref>

Kent is a journalist because Siegel often imagined himself becoming one after leaving school. The love triangle between [[Lois Lane]], Clark, and Superman was inspired by Siegel's own awkwardness with girls.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: Siegel: "As a high school student, I thought that someday I might become a reporter, and I had crushes on several attractive girls who either didn't know I existed or didn't care I existed. [...] It occurred to me: What if I was real terrific? What if I had something special going for me, like jumping over buildings or throwing cars around or something like that? Then maybe they would notice me."</ref>

The pair collected comic strips in their youth, with a favorite being [[Winsor McCay]]'s fantastical ''[[Little Nemo]]''.<ref name=Andrae1983/> Shuster remarked on the artists which played an important part in the development of his own style: "[[Alex Raymond]] and [[Burne Hogarth]] were my idols&nbsp;– also [[Milt Caniff]], [[Hal Foster]], and [[Roy Crane]]."<ref name=Andrae1983/> Shuster taught himself to draw by tracing over the art in the strips and magazines they collected.<ref name=Ricca2014/>

As a boy, Shuster was interested in fitness culture<ref>Shuster in {{harvp|Andrae|1983}} "I tried to build up my body. I was so skinny; I went in for weight-lifting and athletics. I used to get all the body-building magazines from the second-hand stores — and read them...."</ref> and a fan of [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]] such as [[Siegmund Breitbart]] and [[Joseph Greenstein]]. He collected fitness magazines and manuals and used their photographs as visual references for his art.<ref name=Ricca2014/>
[[File:Johny Weissmuller-publicity.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Johnny Weissmuller]], 1940]]
The visual design of Superman came from multiple influences. The tight-fitting suit and shorts were inspired by the costumes of wrestlers, boxers, and [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]]. In early concept art, Shuster gave Superman laced sandals like those of strongmen and classical heroes, but these were eventually changed to red boots.<ref name=Andrae1983_boots/> The costumes of Douglas Fairbanks were also an influence.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "It was inspired by the costume pictures that Fairbanks did: they greatly influenced us."</ref> The emblem on his chest may have been inspired by the uniforms of athletic teams. Many pulp action heroes such as swashbucklers wore capes. Superman's face was based on [[Johnny Weissmuller]] with touches derived from the comic-strip character [[Dick Tracy]] and from the work of cartoonist Roy Crane.<ref name=Ricca2014p124>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}. ''Super Boys'', p. 124: "The overall physical look of Superman himself is from Johnny Weissmuller, whose face Joe swiped from movie magazines and news articles. ... Joe just squinted the eyes like his idol Roy Crane [did with his characters] and added a Dick Tracy smile."

The word "superman" was commonly used in the 1920s and 1930s to describe men of great ability, most often athletes and politicians.<ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}. ''Super Boys'', p. 129: "What the boys did read were the magazines and papers where "superman" was a common word. Its usage was almost always preceded by "a."

A mere decade later, in 2001, the average age of comic book readers was 25."</ref> A major reason for this shift was DC Comics' decision in the 1970s to sell its comic books to specialty stores instead of traditional magazine retailers (supermarkets, newsstands, etc.) — a model called "direct distribution". This made comic books less accessible to children.<ref>{{harvp|Gordon|2017}}. ''Superman: The Persistence of an American Icon'' p. 164</ref>

===Newspaper strips===
{{See also|Superman (comic strip)}}
Beginning in January 1939, a ''Superman'' daily comic strip appeared in newspapers, syndicated through the [[McClure Syndicate]]. A color Sunday version was added that November. Jerry Siegel wrote most of the strips until he was conscripted in 1943. The Sunday strips had a narrative continuity separate from the daily strips, possibly because Siegel had to delegate the Sunday strips to [[ghostwriter]]s.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.tcj.com/reviews/superman-the-golden-age-sundays-1943-1946/| title= Reviews: ''Superman: The Golden Age Sundays 1943–1946''| first= Paul|last=Tumey| work=[[The Comics Journal]] |date=April 14, 2014| access-date= March 1, 2016|archive-date=May 29, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529211844/http://www.tcj.com/reviews/superman-the-golden-age-sundays-1943-1946/ | url-status=live| quote=...Jerry Siegel had his hands — and typewriter — full, turning out stories for the comic books and the daily newspaper strips (which had completely separate continuities from the Sundays).}}</ref> By 1941, the newspaper strips had an estimated readership of 20 million.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}.

===Editors===
Initially, Siegel was allowed to write Superman more or less as he saw fit because nobody had anticipated the success and rapid expansion of the franchise.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 49: "Initially Harry [Donenfeld], Jack [Liebowitz], and the managers they hired to oversee their growing editorial empire had let Jerry [Siegel] do as he wished with the character..."</ref><ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 41: "Neither Harry [Donenfeld] nor Jack [Liebowitz] had planned for a separate Superman comic book, or for that to be ongoing. Having Superman's story play out across different venues presented a challenge for Jerry [Siegel] and the writers who came after him: Each installment needed to seem original yet part of a whole, stylistically and narratively. Their solution, at the beginning, was to wing it..."</ref> But soon Siegel and Shuster's work was put under careful oversight for fear of trouble with censors.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 42: "...the publisher was anxious to avoid any repetition of the censorship problems associated with his early pulp magazines (such as the lurid ''Spicy Detective'')."</ref> Siegel was forced to tone down the violence and social crusading that characterized his early stories.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 49: "Once Superman became big business, however, plots had to be sent to New York for vetting. Not only did editors tell Jerry to cut out the guns and knives and cut back on social crusading, they started calling the shots on minute details of script and drawing."</ref> Editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]], hired in 1940, dictated that Superman not kill.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 42: "It was left to Ellsworth to impose tight editorial controls on Jerry Siegel. Henceforth, Superman would be forbidden to use his powers to kill anyone, even a villain."</ref> Sexuality was banned, and colorfully outlandish villains such as [[Ultra-Humanite]] and [[Toyman]] were thought to be less nightmarish for young readers.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 47: "No hint of sex. No alienating parents or teachers. Evil geniuses like the Ultra-Humanite were too otherworldly to give kids nightmares... The Prankster, the Toyman, the Puzzler, and J. Wilbur Wolngham, a W. C. Fields lookalike, used tricks and gags instead of a bow and arrows in their bids to conquer Superman. For editors wary of controversy, 1940s villains like those were a way to avoid the sharp edges of the real world."</ref>

[[Mort Weisinger]] was the editor on Superman comics from 1941 to 1970, his tenure briefly interrupted by military service. Siegel and his fellow writers had developed the character with little thought of building a coherent mythology, but as the number of Superman titles and the pool of writers grew, Weisinger demanded a more disciplined approach.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 162: "Before Mort came along, Superman's world was ad hoc and seat-of-the-pants, with Jerry and other writers adding elements as they went along without any planning or anyone worrying whether it all hung together. That worked fine when all the books centered around Superman and all the writing was done by a small stable. Now the pool of writers had grown and there were eight different comic books with hundreds of Superman stories a year to worry about."</ref> Weisinger assigned story ideas, and the logic of Superman's powers, his origin, the locales, and his relationships with his growing cast of supporting characters were carefully planned. Elements such as [[Bizarro]], his cousin [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], the [[Phantom Zone]], the [[Fortress of Solitude]], alternate varieties of [[kryptonite]], [[Superman robots|robot doppelgangers]], and [[Krypto]] were introduced during this era. The complicated universe built under Weisinger was beguiling to devoted readers but alienating to casuals.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 173: "But Weisinger's innovations were taking a quiet toll on the story. Superman's world had become so complicated that readers needed a map or even an encyclopedia to keep track of everyone and everything. (There would eventually be encyclopedias, two in fact, but the first did not appear until 1978.) All the plot complications were beguiling to devoted readers, who loved the challenge of keeping current, but to more casual fans they could be exhausting."</ref> Weisinger favored lighthearted stories over serious drama, and avoided sensitive subjects such as the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[civil rights movement|American civil rights movement]] because he feared his [[right-wing]] views would alienate his left-leaning writers and readers.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 165: "Weisinger stories steered clear of the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, the black power movement, and other issues that red the 1960s. There was none of what Mort would have called "touchy-feely" either, much as readers might have liked to know how Clark felt about his split personality, or whether Superman and Lois engaged in the battles between the sexes that were a hallmark of the era. Mort wanted his comics to be a haven for young readers, and he knew his right-leaning politics wouldn't sit well with his leftist writers and many of his Superman fans."</ref> Weisinger also introduced [[Comic book letter column|letters columns]] in 1958 to encourage feedback and build intimacy with readers.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 102: "One of the ways the editor kept in touch with his young audience was through a letters column, 'Metropolis Mailbag,' introduced in 1958."</ref>

Weisinger retired in 1970 and [[Julius Schwartz]] took over. By his own admission, Weisinger had grown out of touch with newer readers.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 168: "He admitted later he was losing touch with a new generation of kids and their notions about heroes and villains."</ref> Schwartz updated Superman by making Clark Kent a television anchor, and he retired overused plot elements such as kryptonite and robot doppelgangers.<ref>Julius Schwartz, quoted in {{harvp|Daniels|1998}}: "I said, 'I want to get rid of all the kryptonite. I want to get rid of all the robots that are used to get him out of situations. And I'm sick and tired of that stupid suit Clark Kent wears all the time. I want to give him more up-to-date clothes.  And maybe the most important thing I want to do is take him out of the Daily Planet and put him into television.' I said 'Our readers are not that familiar with newspapers. Most of them get their news on television, and I think it's high time after all these years.'"</ref> Schwartz also scaled Superman's powers down to a level closer to Siegel's original. These changes would eventually be reversed by later writers. Schwartz allowed stories with serious drama such as "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]" (''Superman Annual'' #11), in which the villain [[Mongul]] torments Superman with an illusion of happy family life on a living Krypton.

Schwartz retired from DC Comics in 1986 and was succeeded by [[Mike Carlin]] as an editor on Superman comics. His retirement coincided with DC Comics' decision to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the [[DC Universe]] with the companywide-crossover storyline "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]". Writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] rewrote the Superman mythos, again reducing Superman's powers, which writers had slowly re-strengthened, and revised many supporting characters, such as making [[Lex Luthor]] a billionaire industrialist rather than a mad scientist, and making Supergirl an [[Supergirl#Matrix|artificial shapeshifting organism]] because DC wanted Superman to be the sole surviving Kryptonian.

Carlin was promoted to Executive Editor for the [[DC Universe]] books in 1996, a position he held until 2002. K.C. Carlson took his place as editor of the Superman comics.

===Aesthetic style===
In the earlier decades of Superman comics, artists were expected to conform to a certain "house style".<ref>{{harvp|Harvey|1996|p=144}}: "Artistic expressiveness of a highly individualistic sort had never been particularly welcomed by traditional comic book publishers. The corporate mind, ever focused on the bottom line of the balance sheet, favored bland "house styles" of rendering..."</ref> Joe Shuster defined the aesthetic style of Superman in the 1940s. After Shuster left National, [[Wayne Boring]] succeeded him as the principal artist on Superman comic books.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{harvp|Eury|Adams|Swan|2006}}. ''The Krypton Companion'', p. 18: "In 1948 Boring succeeded Shuster as the principal superman artist, his art style epitomizing the Man of Steel's comics and merchandising look throughout the 1950s."</ref> He redrew Superman taller and more detailed.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 74: "...Superman was drawn in a more detailed, realistic style of illustration.  He also looked bigger and stronger. "Until then Superman had always seemed squat," Boring said. "He was six heads high, a bit shorter than normal. I made him taller–nine heads high–but kept his massive chest."</ref> Around 1955, [[Curt Swan]] in turn succeeded Boring.<ref name="Curt Swan 1987">Curt Swan (1987). ''Drawing Superman''. Essay reprinted in {{harvp|Eury|2006|pp=58}}: "For 30 years or so, from around 1955 until a couple of years ago when I more or less retired, I was the principal artists of the ''Superman'' comic for DC Comics."</ref> The 1980s saw a boom in the diversity of comic book art and now there is no single "house style" in Superman comics.<ref>{{harvp|Wandtke|2012}}</ref>

The episodes were initially 15 minutes long, but after 1949 they were lengthened to 30 minutes. Most episodes were done live.<ref>{{harvp|Hayde|2009}}. ''Flights of Fantasy''</ref> [[Bud Collyer]] was the voice actor for Superman in most episodes. The show was produced by [[Robert Maxwell (producer)|Robert Maxwell]] and Allen Ducovny, who were employees of Superman, Inc. and Detective Comics, Inc. respectively.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 88: "[Harry Donenfeld] drafted Maxwell into Superman, Inc., first to oversee the licensing of toys and other products, then to bring the superhero into the world of broadcast."</ref><ref>{{harvp|Scivally|2007}}. ''Superman on Film, Television, Radio and Broadway'', p. 16: "Superman was brought to radio by Allen Ducovny, a press agent with Detective Comics, and Robert Maxwell (the pen name of Robert Joffe), a former pulp fiction author who was in charge of licensing the subsidiary rights of the company's comic book characters."</ref>

===Stage===
In 1966 Superman had a [[Tony Awards|Tony]]-nominated musical play produced on Broadway. ''[[It's a Bird... It's a Plane...

The first episode had a production budget of $50,000 with the remaining episodes at $30,000 each<ref>{{harvp|Pointer|2017}}: "...the budget for each short – an astonishing $30,000..."</ref> ({{Inflation|US|30000|1941|fmt=eq|r=-3}}), which was exceptionally lavish for the time; $9,000 – $15,000 was more typical for animated shorts.<ref>Dave Fleischer, quoted in {{harvp|Daniels|1998}} ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 58: "The average short cost nine or ten thousand dollars, some ran up to fifteen; they varied."</ref> Joe Shuster provided model sheets for the characters, so the visuals resembled the contemporary comic book aesthetic.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}. ''Superman'', p. 94: "Max and Dave [Fleischer's] composers knew what Superman, Lois, and the others should look like, thanks to model sheets provided by Joe Shuster."</ref>

* ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', which aired from 1952 to 1958, was the first television series based on a superhero. It starred [[George Reeves]] as Superman. Whereas the radio serial was aimed at children, this television show was aimed at a general audience,<ref>Bernard Luber, quoted in ''Flights of Fantasy'' {{harv|Hayde|2009}}: "The show wasn't strictly for youngsters.

===Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster===
{{Main|Copyright lawsuits by Superman's creators}}

In a contract dated 1 March 1938, [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] gave away the copyright to Superman to their employer, [[DC Comics]] (then known as Detective Comics, Inc.{{efn|National Allied Publications was founded in 1934 by Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson. Due to financial difficulties, Wheeler-Nicholson formed a corporation with Harry Donenfeld and Jack Liebowitz called Detective Comics, Inc. In January 1938, Wheeler-Nicholson sold his stake in National Allied Publications and Detective Comics to Donenfeld and Liebowitz as part of a bankruptcy settlement. On September 30, 1946, these two companies merged to become National Comics Publications. In 1961, the company changed its name to National Periodical Publications. In 1967 National Periodical Publications was purchased by Kinney National Company, which later purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts and became Warner Communications. In 1976, National Periodical Publications changed its name to DC Comics, which had been its nickname since 1940. Since 1940, the publisher had placed a logo with the initials "DC" on all its magazine covers, and consequently "DC Comics" became an informal name for the publisher.|name=dccomicshistory}}) prior to Superman's first publication in April. Contrary to popular perception, the $130 that DC Comics paid them was for their first Superman story, not the copyright to the character — that, they gave away for free. This was normal practice in the comic magazine industry and they had done the same with their previous published works ([[Slam Bradley]], [[Doctor Occult]], etc.),<ref name=Jones2004p125/> but Superman became far more popular and valuable than they anticipated and they much regretted giving him away.<ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}.

DC Comics rehired Jerry Siegel as a writer in 1959.

In 1965, Siegel and Shuster attempted to regain rights to Superman using the renewal option in the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], but the court ruled Siegel and Shuster had transferred the renewal rights to DC Comics in 1938. Siegel and Shuster appealed, but the appeals court upheld this decision. DC Comics fired Siegel when he filed this second lawsuit.{{fact|date=May 2022}}

In 1975, Siegel and a number of other comic book writers and artists launched a public campaign for better compensation and treatment of comic creators. Warner Brothers agreed to give Siegel and Shuster a yearly stipend, full medical benefits, and credit their names in all future Superman productions in exchange for never contesting ownership of Superman. Siegel and Shuster upheld this bargain.<ref name=Ricca2014/>

Shuster died in 1992. DC Comics offered Shuster's heirs a stipend in exchange for never challenging ownership of Superman, which they accepted for some years.<ref name=Sergi2015/>

Siegel died in 1996. His heirs attempted to take the rights to Superman using the termination provision of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. DC Comics negotiated an agreement wherein it would pay the Siegel heirs several million dollars and a yearly stipend of $500,000 in exchange for permanently granting DC the rights to Superman. DC Comics also agreed to insert the line "By Special Arrangement with the Jerry Siegel Family" in all future Superman productions.<ref>Exhibit 2 (Docket 722–1) in ''Laura Siegel Larson vs Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., DC Comics, case no 13-56243''.</ref> The Siegels accepted DC's offer in an October 2001 letter.<ref name=Sergi2015/>

Copyright lawyer and movie producer [[Marc Toberoff]] then struck a deal with the heirs of both Siegel and Shuster to help them get the rights to Superman in exchange for signing the rights over to his production company, Pacific Pictures. Both groups accepted. The Siegel heirs called off their deal with DC Comics and in 2004 sued DC for the rights to Superman and Superboy. In 2008, the judge ruled in favor of the Siegels. DC Comics appealed the decision, and the appeals court ruled in favor of DC, arguing that the October 2001 letter was binding. In 2003, the Shuster heirs served a termination notice for Shuster's grant of his half of the copyright to Superman. DC Comics sued the Shuster heirs in 2010, and the court ruled in DC's favor on the grounds that the 1992 agreement with the Shuster heirs barred them from terminating the grant.<ref name=Sergi2015/>

===Captain Marvel===
{{See also|National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications}}
Superman's success immediately begat a wave of imitations. The most successful of these at this early age was [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], first published by [[Fawcett Comics]] in December 1939. Captain Marvel had many similarities to Superman: Herculean strength, invulnerability, the ability to fly, a cape, a secret identity, and a job as a journalist. DC Comics filed a lawsuit against Fawcett Comics for copyright infringement.{{fact|date=May 2022}}

The trial began in March 1948 after seven years of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]. The judge ruled that Fawcett had indeed infringed on Superman. However, the judge also found that the copyright notices that appeared with the Superman newspaper strips did not meet the technical standards of the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] and were therefore invalid. Furthermore, since the newspaper strips carried stories adapted from ''Action Comics'', the judge ruled that DC Comics had effectively abandoned the copyright to the ''Action Comics'' stories and Superman, and therefore forfeited its right to sue Fawcett for copyright infringement.<ref name="Sergi2015"/>

DC Comics appealed this decision. The appeals court ruled that unintentional mistakes in the copyright notices of the newspaper strips did not invalidate the copyrights. Furthermore, Fawcett knew that DC Comics never intended to abandon the copyrights, and therefore Fawcett's infringement was not an innocent misunderstanding, and therefore Fawcett owed damages to DC Comics.{{efn|See [https://www.copyright.gov/history/1909act.pdf Copyright Act of 1909] § 20}} The appeals court remanded the case back to the lower court to determine how much Fawcett owed in damages.<ref name="Sergi2015"/>

At that point, Fawcett Comics decided to settle out of court with DC Comics. Fawcett paid DC Comics $400,000 ({{Inflation|US|400000|1953|fmt=eq}}) and agreed to stop publishing Captain Marvel. The last Captain Marvel story from Fawcett Comics was published in September 1953.<ref>''The Marvel Family'' #89.

United States Library of Congress. 1954. p. 268.</ref>

DC Comics licensed Captain Marvel in 1972 and published crossover stories with Superman. By 1991, DC Comics had purchased Fawcett Comics and with it the full rights to Captain Marvel. DC eventually renamed the character "Shazam" to prevent disputes with [[Marvel Comics]], who had created [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|a character of their own named "Captain Marvel"]] back when the Fawcett character had lingered in limbo.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article">{{cite journal| last1 = Thomas| first1 = Roy| author-link1=Roy Thomas|first2= Jerry|last2= Ordway|author-link2=Jerry Ordway|title = Not Your Father's Captain Marvel!

==Character overview==
This section details the most consistent elements of the Superman narrative in the myriad stories published since 1938.

===Superman himself===
In ''[[Action Comics]]'' [[Action Comics 1|#1]] (1938), Superman is born on an alien world to a technologically advanced species that resembles humans. Shortly after he is born, his planet is destroyed in a natural cataclysm, but Superman's scientist father foresaw the calamity and saves his baby son by sending him to Earth in a small spaceship. The ship is too small to carry anyone else, so Superman's parents stay behind and die. The earliest newspaper strips name the planet "Krypton", the baby "Kal-L", and his biological parents "Jor-L" and "Lora";<ref>[http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/daily/ep01_15/episode1_1.jpg ''Superman'' comic strip, January 16, 1939] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008215921/http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/daily/ep01_15/episode1_1.jpg |date=October 8, 2016 }}, reprinted at {{cite web|url=http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/daily/ep01_15/ep1.html |title=Episode 1: Superman Comes to Earth |publisher=TheSpeedingBullet.com |access-date=March 27, 2016 |archive-date=March 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306164334/http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/daily/ep01_15/ep1.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> their names were changed to "Jor-el", and "Lara" in a 1942 spinoff novel by George Lowther.<ref>Lowther, George (1942).

In ''Action Comics'' #1 and most stories published before 1986, Superman's powers begin developing in infancy. From 1944 to 1986, DC Comics regularly published stories of Superman's childhood and adolescent adventures, when he called himself "[[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]". From 1986 on (beginning with ''Man of Steel'' #1), Superman's powers emerged more slowly and he began his superhero career as an adult.

The Kents teach Clark he must conceal his otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good. Clark creates the costumed identity of Superman so as to protect his personal privacy and the safety of his loved ones. As Clark Kent, he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his Superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment's notice. To complete this disguise, Clark avoids violent confrontation, preferring to slip away and change into Superman when danger arises, and in older stories he would suffer occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice.

In ''Superboy'' #78 (1960), Superboy makes his costume out of the indestructible blankets found in the ship he came to Earth in. In ''Man of Steel'' #1 (1986), Martha Kent makes the costume from human-manufactured cloth, and it is rendered indestructible by an "aura" that Superman projects. The "S" on Superman's chest at first was simply an initial for "Superman". When writing the script for [[Superman (1978 film)|the 1978 movie]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]] made it Superman's Kryptonian family crest.<ref name=MankiewiczCrane2012p203/> This was carried over into some comic book stories and later movies, such as ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''. In the comic story ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', the crest is described as an old Kryptonian symbol for hope.

Clark works as a newspaper journalist. In the earliest stories, he worked for ''The Daily Star'', but the second episode of [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|the radio serial]] changed this to the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. In comics from the early 1970s, Clark worked as a television journalist (an attempt to modernize the character). However, for [[Superman (1978 film)|the 1978 movie]], the producers chose to make Clark a newspaper journalist again because that was how most of the public thought of him.<ref name=Daniels1998/>

The first story in which Superman dies was published in ''Superman'' #149 (1961), in which he is murdered by Lex Luthor by means of kryptonite. This story was "imaginary" and thus was ignored in subsequent books. In ''Superman'' #188 (April 1966), Superman is killed by kryptonite radiation but is revived in the same issue by one of [[Superman robots|his android doppelgangers]]. In the 1990s ''[[The Death of Superman|The Death and Return of Superman]]'' story arc, after a deadly battle with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Superman died in ''Superman'' #75 (Jan. 1993). He was later revived by the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] using Kryptonian technology. In ''Superman'' #52 (May 2016) Superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning, and this time he is not resurrected, but replaced by the Superman of an alternate timeline.

Superman maintains a secret hideout called the "Fortress of Solitude", which is located somewhere in the Arctic. Here, Superman keeps a collection of mementos and a laboratory for science experiments. In ''Action Comics'' #241, the Fortress of Solitude is a cave in a mountain, sealed with a very heavy door that is opened with a gigantic key too heavy for anyone but Superman to use. In the 1978 movie, the Fortress of Solitude is a structure made out of crystal.

=== Clark Kent ===
{{redirect|Clark Kent}}
Superman's [[secret identity]] is Clark Joseph Kent, a reporter for the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Although his name and history originate from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', he receives late-breaking news before the general public, always has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his publication deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities—bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.batman-superman.com/superman/cmp/index.html | title=The New Batman/Superman Adventures | publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202074631/http://www.batman-superman.com/superman/cmp/index.html |archive-date=February 2, 2007}}</ref> In the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], Clark Kent was featured in a series that appeared primarily in ''[[The Superman Family]]'', "The Private Life of Clark Kent" where Superman dealt with various situations subtly while remaining Clark.

To deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a mainly passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice, and a slight slouch. This personality is typically described as "mild-mannered", as in the opening narration of [[Max Fleischer]]'s [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|''Superman'' animated theatrical shorts]]. These traits extended into Clark's wardrobe, which typically consists of a bland-colored business suit, a red necktie, black-rimmed glasses, combed-back hair, and occasionally a [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]]. Clark wears his Superman costume underneath his street clothes, allowing easy changes between the two [[persona]]e and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar "S" emblem when called into action. His hair also changes with the clothing change, with Superman sporting a small curl or [[spit curl]] on his forehead. Superman usually stores his Clark Kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape,<ref>{{Cite comic |penciller=John Sikela|story=The Origin of Superboy's Costume! |title=Superboy |volume=1 |issue=78 |date=January 1960 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=New York, NY}}</ref> though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location (such as the ''Daily Planet'' storeroom<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Steven T. Seagle|Seagle, Steven T.]] |penciller=[[Scott McDaniel|McDaniel, Scott]] |inker=Owens, Andy |story=Truth |title=Superman: The 10¢ Adventure |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=March 2003 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=New York, NY}}</ref>) for later retrieval.

As Superman's [[alter ego]], the personality, concept, and name of Clark Kent have become synonymous with [[secret identity|secret identities]] and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities. In 1992, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster told the ''Toronto Star'' that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men [[Clark Gable]] and [[Kent Taylor]], but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic [[Harold Lloyd]] and himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidschutz.tripod.com/superman3.html |title=When Superman Worked at The Star |last=Schutz |first=David |website=The Adventures of Superman |date=April 26, 1992 |access-date=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717013550/http://davidschutz.tripod.com/superman3.html |archive-date=July 17, 2010 }}</ref> Clark's middle name is given variously as either Joseph, Jerome, or Jonathan, all being allusions to creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.

=== Personality ===
In the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman's personality is rough and aggressive. He often uses excessive force and terror against criminals, on some occasions even killing them. This came to an end in late 1940 when new editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]] instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing.<ref name="TCS42">{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 42</ref> The character was softened and given a sense of [[humanitarianism]]. Ellsworth's code, however, is not to be confused with "[[Comics Code Authority|the Comics Code]]", which was created in 1954 by the [[Comics Code Authority]] and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century.<ref>[[Lee, Jim]].

In his first appearances, Superman was considered a vigilante by the authorities, being fired upon by the National Guard as he razed a slum so that the government would create better housing conditions for the poor. By 1942, however, Superman was working side-by-side with the police.<ref name="Weldon33"/><ref>{{harvp|Weldon|2013}}.

===Powers, abilities, and weaknesses<!--'Heat vision (fiction)' redirects here-->===
The catalog of Superman's abilities and his strength has varied considerably over the vast body of Superman fiction released since 1938.

Since ''[[Action Comics]]'' [[Action Comics 1|#1]] (1938), Superman has superhuman strength. The cover of ''Action Comics'' #1 shows him effortlessly lifting a car over his head. Another classic feat of strength on Superman's part is breaking steel chains. In some stories, he is strong enough to shift the orbits of planets<ref>Example: ''DC Comics Presents'' #3 (1978)</ref> and crush coal into diamond with his hands.

Since ''Action Comics'' #1 (1938), Superman has a highly durable body, invulnerable for most practical purposes. At the very least, bullets bounce harmlessly off his body. In some stories, such as [[Kingdom Come (comics)|''Kingdom Come'']], not even a nuclear bomb can harm him.

In the earliest stories, Superman's costume is made out of exotic materials that are as tough as he is, which is why it typically doesn't tear up when he does superman feats. In later stories, beginning with ''Man of Steel'' #1 (1986), Superman's body is said to project an aura that renders invulnerable any tight-fitting clothes he wears, and hence his costume is as durable as he is even if made of common cloth.

In ''Action Comics'' #1, Superman could not fly. He traveled by running and leaping thanks to his superhuman speed, which he could do to a prodigious degree thanks to his strength. Superman gained the ability to fly in the second episode of [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|the radio serial]] in 1940.<ref name=radioserialep2>{{Cite episode |title=Clark Kent, Reporter |series=The Adventures of Superman |number=2 |station=WOR |date=February 14, 1940}}:<br />–&hairsp;''Look! Look! There, in the sky! It's a man!''<br />–&hairsp;''Why, he's flying!''<br />–&hairsp;''It can't be! It's not possible!''</ref> Superman can fly at great speeds. He can break the sound barrier, and in some stories, he can even fly faster than the speed of light to travel to distant galaxies.

Superman can project and perceive X-rays via his eyes, which allows him to see through objects. He first uses this power in ''Action Comics'' #11 (1939). Certain materials such as lead can block his X-ray vision.

Superman can project beams of heat from his eyes which are hot enough to melt steel. He first used this power in ''Superman'' #59 (1949) by applying his X-ray vision at its highest intensity. In later stories, this ability is simply called "heat vision".

Superman can hear sounds that are too faint for a human to hear, and at frequencies outside the human hearing range. This ability was introduced in ''Action Comics'' #11 (1939).

Since ''Action Comics'' #20 (1940), Superman possesses superhuman breath, which enables him to inhale or blow huge amounts of air, as well as holding his breath indefinitely to remain underwater or space without adverse effects. He has a significant focus of his breath's intensity to the point of freezing targets by blowing on them. The "freeze breath" was first demonstrated in ''Superman'' #129 (1959).

''Action Comics'' #1 (1938) explained that Superman's strength was common to all Kryptonians because they were a species "millions of years advanced of our own". In the first newspaper strips, Jor-El is shown running and leaping like Superman, and his wife survives a building collapsing on her. Later stories explained they evolved superhuman strength simply because of Krypton's higher gravity. ''Superman'' #146 (1961) established that Superman's abilities other than strength (flight, durability, etc.) are activated by the light of Earth's yellow [[sun]]. In ''Action Comics'' #300 (1963), all of his powers including strength are activated by yellow sunlight and can be deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of Krypton's sun.

Exposure to green [[kryptonite]] radiation nullifies Superman's powers and incapacitates him with pain and nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. Although green kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with peculiar effects.<ref name="TCS106107">Daniels (1998), pp. 106–107.</ref> Gold kryptonite, for instance, nullifies Superman's powers but otherwise does not harm him. [[Kryptonite]] first appeared in a 1943 episode of [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|the radio serial]].<ref>''The Meteor From Krypton'' (June 1943). Per {{harvp|Hayde|2009}}: "Only one arc in 1943 managed to transcend its era: "The Meteor from Krypton." Debuting on June 3, it marked the debut of kryptonite..."</ref> It first appeared in comics in ''Superman'' #61 (Dec. 1949).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/7882/#74473 ''Superman'' #61] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427020730/http://www.comics.org/issue/7882/ |date=April 27, 2016 }} at the [[Grand Comics Database]]. "Indexer notes ... Green Kryptonite introduced in this story."</ref>

Superman is also vulnerable to magic. Enchanted weapons and magical spells affect Superman as easily as they would a normal human. This weakness was established in ''Superman'' #171 (1964).

Like all Kryptonians, Kal-El is also highly susceptible to psychokinetic phenomena ranging along Telekinesis, Illusion casting, Mind control, etc. As shown in ''Wonder Woman'' Vol 2 # 219  (Sept. 2005). A powerful enough psionic can affect either the psyche or microbiology of Superman to induce strokes or mangle his internals, as well as disrupt his mind and perceptions of the world; something a young power amped Gene-Bomb meta showcased in ''Superman'' #48 (Oct. 1990).

===Supporting characters===
{{See also|Superman character and cast|List of Superman supporting characters}}

Superman's first and most famous supporting character is [[Lois Lane]], introduced in ''Action Comics'' #1. She is a fellow journalist at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. As Jerry Siegel conceived her, Lois considers Clark Kent to be a wimp, but she is infatuated with the bold and mighty Superman, not knowing that Kent and Superman are the same person. Siegel objected to any proposal that Lois discover that Clark is Superman because he felt that, as implausible as Clark's disguise is, the love triangle was too important to the book's appeal.<ref>"If Lois should ACTUALLY learn Clark's secret, the strip would lose about 75% of its appeal—the human interest angle. I know that a formula can possibly prove monotonous through repetition but I fear that if this element is removed from the story formula that makes up SUPERMAN, that this strip will lose a great part of its effectiveness." Siegel, in his script notes, quoted in {{harvp|Ricca|2014}} (''Super Boys'').</ref> However, Siegel wrote stories in which Lois suspects Clark is Superman and tries to prove it, with Superman always duping her in the end; the first such story was in ''Superman'' #17 (July–August 1942).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/2212/ ''Superman'' #17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415134500/http://www.comics.org/issue/2212/ |date=April 15, 2016 }} at the Grand Comics Database.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/06/28/when-we-first-met-30/ | title=When We First Met |publisher=(column #30) [[ComicBookResources.com]]| first=Brian |last=Cronin | date= June 28, 2011 |access-date=March 16, 2016 | archive-date= October 17, 2013| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131017031635/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/06/28/when-we-first-met-30/ | url-status=live}}</ref> This was a common plot in comic book stories prior to the 1970s. In a story in ''Action Comics'' #484 (June 1978), Clark Kent admits to Lois that he is Superman, and they marry. This was the first story in which Superman and Lois marry that wasn't an "imaginary tale." Many Superman stories since then have depicted Superman and Lois as a married couple, but about as many depict them in the classic love triangle. In modern era comic books, Superman and Lois are a stable married couple, and the ''Superman'' supporting cast was further expanded with the introduction of their son, [[Jon Kent (comics)|Jonathan Kent]].

Other supporting characters include [[Jimmy Olsen]], a photographer at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', who is friends with both Superman and Clark Kent, though in most stories he doesn't know that Clark is Superman. Jimmy is frequently described as "Superman's pal", and was conceived to give young male readers a relatable character through which they could fantasize being friends with Superman.

In the earliest comic book stories, Clark Kent's employer is George Taylor of ''The Daily Star'', but the second episode of [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|the radio serial]] changed this to [[Perry White]] of the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.<ref>{{harvp|Scivally|2007}}. ''Superman on Film, Television, Radio and Broadway'': "The episode also introduced Julian Noa as Clark Kent's boss, whose name had evolved from Paris White to Perry White. White's newspaper changed from ''The Daily Flash'' to the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Soon after the radio show appeared, the comic books also changed their ''Daily Star'' editor George Taylor to ''[[Daily Planet]]'' editor Perry White..."</ref>

Clark Kent's foster parents are [[Ma and Pa Kent]]. In many stories, one or both of them have died by the time Clark becomes Superman. Clark's parents taught him that he should use his abilities for altruistic means, but that he should also find some way to safeguard his private life.

===Antagonists===
{{Main|List of Superman enemies}}
The villains Superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans, such as gangsters, corrupt politicians, and violent husbands; but they soon grew more colorful and outlandish so as to avoid offending censors or scaring children. The mad scientist [[Ultra-Humanite]], introduced in ''Action Comics'' #13 (June 1939), was Superman's first recurring villain. Superman's best-known nemesis, [[Lex Luthor]], was introduced in ''Action Comics'' #23 (April 1940) and has been depicted as either a mad scientist or a wealthy businessman (sometimes both).<ref name="TCS160">{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman: The Complete History'', p. 160</ref> In 1944, the magical imp [[Mister Mxyzptlk]], Superman's first recurring super-powered adversary, was introduced.<ref>Though created to appear in ''Superman'' #30 (Sept. 1944), publishing lag time resulted in the character first appearing in the ''Superman'' daily comic strip that year, per [http://www.comics.org/issue/3811/ ''Superman'' #30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311072244/http://www.comics.org/issue/3811/ |date=March 11, 2016 }} at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> Superman's first alien villain, [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], debuted in ''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958). The monstrous [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], introduced in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #17–18 (Nov.-Dec. 1992), was the first villain to evidently kill Superman in physical combat without exploiting Superman's critical weaknesses such as kryptonite and magic.

===Alternative depictions===
{{Main|Alternative versions of Superman}}
{{See also|Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman (Earth-One)}}
The details Superman's story and supporting cast vary across his large body of fiction released since 1938, but most versions conform to the basic template described above. A few stories feature radically altered versions of Superman. An example is the graphic novel ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', which depicts a communist Superman who rules the Soviet Union. DC Comics has on some occasions published crossover stories where different versions of Superman interact with each other using the plot device of parallel universes. For instance, in the 1960s, the Superman of "Earth-One" would occasionally feature in stories alongside the Superman of "Earth-Two", the latter of whom resembled Superman as he was portrayed in the 1940s. DC Comics has not developed a consistent and universal system to classify all versions of Superman.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
===The superhero archetype===
Superman is often thought of as the first [[superhero]]. This point can be debated: [[Ogon Bat]], [[the Phantom]], [[Zorro]], and [[Mandrake the Magician]] arguably fit the definition of the superhero yet predate Superman. Nevertheless, Superman popularized this kind of character and established the conventions: a costume, a codename, extraordinary abilities, and an altruistic mission. Superman's success in 1938 begat a wave of imitations, which include [[Batman]], [[Captain America]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. This flourishing is today referred to as America's [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], which lasted from 1938 to about 1950. The Golden Age ended when American superhero book sales declined, leading to the cancellation of many characters; but Superman was one of the few superhero franchises that survived this decline, and his sustained popularity into the late 1950s led to a revival in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], when characters such as [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], and [[The X-Men]] were created.

After World War 2, American superhero fiction entered Japanese culture. [[Astro Boy]], first published in 1952, was inspired by [[Mighty Mouse]], which in turn was a parody of Superman.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schodt |first=Frederik L. |title=The Astro Boy Essays: Osamu Tezuka, Mighty Atom, and the Manga/Anime Revolution |year=2007 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |isbn=9781933330549 |page=45}}</ref> The [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|''Superman'' animated shorts from the 1940s]] were first broadcast on Japanese television in 1955, and they were followed in 1956 by the TV show [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Adventures of Superman'']] starring [[George Reeves]]. These shows were popular with the Japanese and inspired Japan's own prolific genre of superheroes. The first Japanese superhero movie, ''[[Super Giant]]'', was released in 1957. The first Japanese superhero TV show was ''[[Moonlight Mask]]'' in 1958. Other notable Japanese superheroes include [[Ultraman]], [[Kamen Rider]], and [[Sailor Moon]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Craig |first=Timothy |title=Japan Pop: Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture |year=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317467212 }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Hirofumi|last= Katsuno |title=The Grotesque Hero: Depictions of Justice in Tokusatsu Superhero Television Programs |encyclopedia= Introducing Japanese Popular Culture |editor1=Freedman, Alisa |editor2=Slade, Toby |year=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317528937 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Jonathan |last1=Clements |first2=Motoko|last2= Tamamuro |year=2003 |title=The Dorama Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese TV Drama Since 1953 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |isbn=9781880656815 }}</ref>

== Literary analysis ==
Superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms in the years since his debut, with [[Umberto Eco]] noting that "he can be seen as the representative of all his similars".<ref>{{cite book |last=Eco |first=Umberto |author-link=Umberto Eco |editor=Heer, Jeet Heer |editor-first2=Worcesterm |editor-last2=Kent |title=Arguing Comics |year=2004 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=1-57806-687-5|page=162 |chapter=The Myth of Superman |orig-year=1962 }}</ref> Writing in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1971, Gerald Clarke stated: "Superman's enormous popularity might be looked upon as signaling the beginning of the end for the [[Horatio Alger myth]] of the [[self-made man]]." Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance and thus representing the mood of the nation. He regarded Superman's character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world, which he saw as a place in which "only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Gerald |last=Clarke |author-link=Gerald Clarke (author) |title=The Comics On The Couch |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842864,00.html |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |issn=0040-781X |pages=1–4 |date=December 13, 1971 |access-date=January 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930062820/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C842864%2C00.html |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> Andrew Arnold, writing in the early 21st century, has noted Superman's partial role in exploring assimilation, the character's alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level.

A.C. Grayling, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', traces Superman's stances through the decades, from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of [[Al Capone]], through the 1940s and World War II, a period in which Superman helped sell [[war bonds]],<ref name="60Y64">{{harvp|Daniels|1995}}. ''DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes'', p. 64</ref> and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the [[Cold War]] as being one where "matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions", and discusses events post [[9/11]], stating that as a nation "caught between the terrifying [[George W. Bush]] and the terrorist [[Osama bin Laden]], America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. And here he is, the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape".<ref>{{cite news|first=A C |last=Grayling |title=The Philosophy of Superman: A Short Course |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/archive/features/23525/the-philosophy-of-superman.thtml |work=The Spectator |location=UK |issn=0038-6952 |date=July 8, 2006 |access-date=January 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011230733/http://spectator.co.uk/archive/features/23525/the-philosophy-of-superman.thtml |archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}</ref>

[[Scott Bukatman]] has discussed Superman, and the superhero in general, noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space, especially in Superman's ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of Metropolis. He writes that the character "represented, in 1938, a kind of [[Le Corbusier|Corbusierian]] ideal. Superman has X-ray vision: walls become permeable, transparent. Through his benign, controlled authority, Superman renders the city open, modernist and democratic; he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925, namely, that 'Everything is known to us'."<ref name="MOG">{{cite book | last=Bukatman | first=Scott | author-link=Scott Bukatman | year=2003 | title=Matters of Gravity: Special Effects and Supermen in the 20th century | url=https://archive.org/details/mattersofgravity0000buka | url-access=registration | publisher=[[Duke University Press]] | isbn=0-8223-3132-2 }}</ref>
[[File:Library of Congress celebration of Action Comics and Superman.jpg|alt=Three men seated onstage, flanked by Superman material|thumb|The [[Library of Congress]] hosting a discussion with [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[Paul Levitz]] for Superman's 80th anniversary and the [[Action Comics 1000|1,000th issue]] of ''[[Action Comics]]''.]]
[[Jules Feiffer]] has argued that Superman's real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona, noting that what "made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent." Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman's popularity in simple wish fulfillment,<ref>[[Jules Feiffer]] ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', (2003). [[Fantagraphics]]. {{ISBN|1-56097-501-6}}</ref> a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that "If you're interested in what made Superman what it is, here's one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. Joe and I had certain inhibitions… which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That's where the dual-identity concept came from" and Shuster supporting that as being "why so many people could relate to it".<ref>Andrae (1983), [https://web.archive.org/web/20031207220852/http://superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=10 p.10].</ref>

[[Ian Gordon (historian)|Ian Gordon]] suggests that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. He defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman, he notes was very much part of that effort.<ref>[[Ian Gordon (historian)|Ian Gordon]] "Nostalgia, Myth, and Ideology: Visions of Superman at the End of the 'American Century"in Michael Ryan, ' 'Cultural Studies: An Anthology' '(2007). Blackwell {{ISBN|978-1-4051-4577-0}} [https://nus.academia.edu/IanGordon/Papers/509594/Nostalgia_Myth_and_Ideology_Visions_of_Superman_at_the_End_of_the_American_Century].</ref>

===An allegory for immigrants===
Superman's immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal.<ref>Fingeroth, Danny ''Superman on the Couch'' (2004). Continuum International Publishing Group p53. {{ISBN|0-8264-1539-3}}</ref><ref name="Engle">Engle, Gary "What Makes Superman So Darned American?" reprinted in ''Popular Culture'' (1992) Popular Press p&nbsp;331–343. {{ISBN|0-87972-572-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Daniel|first2=Bryan |last2=Singer |title=The Art of Superman Returns|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2006|page=92|isbn=0-8118-5344-6}}</ref> Aldo Regalado saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in America. The extraterrestrial origin was seen by Regalado as challenging the notion that [[Anglo-Saxon]] ancestry was the source of all might.<ref>{{cite book|first=Regalado|last= Aldo| chapter=Modernity, Race, and the American Superhero|editor-last= McLaughlin|editor-first= Jeff |title=Comics as Philosophy|year=2005|publisher=[[University of Mississippi]] Press|page=92|isbn=1-57806-794-4}}</ref> Gary Engle saw the "myth of Superman [asserting] with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in [[American culture]]." He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the [[Western (genre)|Western]] as the expression of immigrant sensibilities. Through the use of a dual identity, Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both of their cultures. Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual, allowing Superman to express the immigrants' cultural heritage for the greater good.<ref name="Engle" /> David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view. He argues that Superman's early stories portray a threat: "the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country."<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenemann|first=David|title=Adorno in America|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=2007|page=180|isbn=978-0-8166-4809-2}}</ref> David Rooney, a [[critic|theater critic]] for ''The New York Times'', in his evaluation of the play, ''Year Zero'', considers Superman to be the "quintessential immigrant story… (b)orn on an alien planet, he grows stronger on Earth, but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm."<ref name="Rooney">{{cite news|last=Rooney |first=David |title=Finding America, Searching for Identity |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/theater/reviews/03year.html |access-date=June 11, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609111610/http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/theater/reviews/03year.html |archive-date=June 9, 2010 }}</ref>

===Religious themes===
Some believe that Superman took inspiration from Judaic mythology. The British rabbi [[Simcha Weinstein]] notes that Superman's story has some parallels to that of [[Moses]]. For example, Moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and adopted by a foreign culture. Weinstein also posits that Superman's Kryptonian name, "Kal-El", resembles the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words קוֹל-אֵל (''qōl ʾēl'') which can be taken to mean "voice of God".<ref name="UUaOV">{{cite book | last=Weinstein| first=Simcha| author-link=Simcha Weinstein | year=2006 | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey! | edition=1st | publisher=Leviathan Press | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7 }}</ref> The historian [[Larry Tye]] suggests that this "Voice of God" is an allusion to Moses' role as a prophet.<ref name="Tye, 2012">{{cite book|author-link=Larry Tye|last=Tye|first=Larry|title=Superman: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero|year=2012|publisher=[[Random House Digital]]|isbn=978-1-4000-6866-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/supermanhighflyi00tyel_0/page/65 65–67]|quote=Like Moses. Much as the baby prophet was floated in a reed basket by a mother desperate to spare him from an Egyptian Pharaoh's death warrant, so Kal-El's doomed…|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/supermanhighflyi00tyel_0/page/65}}</ref> The suffix "[[El (god)|el]]", meaning "god", is also found in the name of angels (e.g. [[Gabriel]], [[Ariel (angel)|Ariel]]), who are airborne humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers. The Nazis also thought Superman was a Jew and in 1940 [[Joseph Goebbels]] publicly denounced Superman and his creator Jerry Siegel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goebbels |first=Paul Joseph |date=April 25, 1940 |title=Jerry Siegel Attacks! |page=8 |url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/superman.htm |newspaper=Das schwarze Korps |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112183828/http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/superman.htm |archive-date=January 12, 2016 }}</ref>

All that said, historians such as Martin Lund and Les Daniels argue that the evidence for Judaic influence in Siegel's stories is merely circumstantial. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were not practicing Jews and never acknowledged the influence of Judaism in any memoir or interview.<ref>{{harvp|Lund|2016}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}. ''Superman'', p. 19: "There are parallel stories in many cultures, but what is significant is that Siegel, working in the generally patronized medium of the comics, had created a secular American messiah. Nothing of the kind was consciously on his mind, apparently: his explanation for dropping Superman down from the sky was that "it just happened that way."And Shuster echoed him: "We just thought it was a good idea.""</ref>

Superman stories have occasionally exhibited Christian themes as well. Screenwriter [[Tom Mankiewicz]] consciously made Superman an allegory for Jesus Christ in [[Superman (1978 film)|the 1978 movie]] starring [[Christopher Reeve]]: baby Kal-El's ship resembles the [[Star of Bethlehem]], and Jor-El gives his son a messianic mission to lead humanity into a brighter future.<ref name=SteelDreams>{{cite magazine |last=Dickholtz |first=Daniel |date=1998 |title=Steel Dreams |url=http://supermania78.com/2010/08/tom-mankiewicz-1942-2010/ |magazine=Starlog Yearbook |page=77 |publisher=Starlog Group, Inc.}}</ref>
This messianic theme was revisited in the 2013 movie [[Man of Steel (film)|''Man of Steel'']], wherein Jor-El asks Superman to redeem the Kryptonian race, which corrupted itself through eugenics, by guiding humanity down a wiser path.<ref>''Man of Steel'' (2013; Warner Bros. Pictures). "They won't necessarily make the same mistakes we did, not if you guide them, Kal."</ref>
