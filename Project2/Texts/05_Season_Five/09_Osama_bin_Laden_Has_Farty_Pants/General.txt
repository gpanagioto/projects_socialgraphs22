Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks ''back!'' We're coming, Miss Nicks! Hang on! We've done it! The Taliban is destroyed! Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies! The world is now safe, thanks to you. And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks!
