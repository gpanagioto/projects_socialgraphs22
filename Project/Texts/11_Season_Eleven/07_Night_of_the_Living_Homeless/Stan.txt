 Sir, could you move a little, please? Well dude, what are ''we'' supposed to do? Yeah, it's all set. That was a sweet idea, Kyle.  Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house? I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on. Kyle, what were you thinking? Dude, it's our dads. Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents.  Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town. Over here!  Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house.  Are you the head of Homeless Studies? We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday- There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them. Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now! What the hell happened here?  We, just came to ask a question. Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem. Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump! What?  But then you didn't solve the problem, you just ''moved'' it! Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this! No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle! All right, I'm turning around Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
