Because that's what trolls DO! I should have known that once they got wind of our little plan, they would start trolling us! Of course not! We can't respond, it will only make the trolls stronger! Our only choice is to go offline Everything, you ignoramus! The only way to stop the bleeding is for Denmark to get off social media! Pokkers Du Trold! 	A message how? We're completely offline. 	Put it on the screen.  Who the hell are these people? Get everyone back inside. If this girl really is that smart and funny, we might have another shot here.  
Enjoying the frikadellers? And the leverpostejs are seasoned to your liking? You keep-a checking your watch, Ambassador Von Miller. Are you late for something? Yes. Well a database that can identify everybody's Internet activity is-a very complex. I'm so pleased you want to help us rid the world of-a trolls. Do you happen to recognize...  this woman? Her name was-a Freja Ollegard. She was Denmark's-a national treasure.  Her final straw was when she was trolled on a live TV show.  Are you alright, Von Miller?! It would be my pleasure. Please, ambassador, explore the servers at your leisure. Let us know if you have any questions.
