Stan, Grandpas has a lot of needs that we can't provide him here. He needs professional supervision. Oh really? Do you have any idea how much money we pay to have Grandpa in that place? Your grandpa is stylin'! Can you imagine being able to just sit around all day and not have to do anything but eat and watch TV? Jesus, Stan! It's not like he's in jail! I can't! I'm too busy busting my ass to pay the bills for that place, and to pay for your guitar lessons! I don't want to go there. It's depressing. Aw you tricked me. Well, it's really great seeing you, Dad. Guess we oughtta hit the road soon. Aw Jesus, now we know where Stan gets his guilt trips from!  Yes. Yeah, we love coming here. Wugh.  We're never visiting here again.
