Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!  ''Right'' now, goddamnit!  Yeah! He just got paroled! What the hell are we gonna do?? Dude, let's play Fireman. Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a ''real'' fire. Then we'll be heroes! Start one. Then we're gonna put it out. Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time. Wow, cool!  We're heroes! Put it out, put it out!  Dude, we are in so much trouble! That's true. No! Yeah, who cares? Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released. Shhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now.   Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection. I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on!  Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders. We've come to... ask you for help. Yeah. What?! Dude, weak!  No! You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class. But mom, my teacher will-  But Mo-o-o- This is hopeless! That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs! No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that ''looks'' like boobs to take a picture of. How do you know?! All right, fine.  Excuse me!  Dude, are we gonna be like that someday? Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge? Dude, what happened? What's that? We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him. No, no, we've just gotta find better help.  There is... one person. Shelly? Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other. Shelly  Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault. We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us! Admit it was our fault? Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you.  See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman." Trent, look, we've realized our mistake!  What is that? Yeah, who cares?
