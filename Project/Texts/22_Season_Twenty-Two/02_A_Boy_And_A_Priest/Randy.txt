Come on, guys, we don't wanna be late! We're all going. Come on!  Church is important, Stan. Way more important than video games and TV. Church is about community and coming together. A lot of things. Yeah. Me too. Hey, mornin' Stephen, Linda. You got it- hey, where's Josie? Aw, she's gonna miss church? That's too bad. Give her my best.  Kind of like a priest in a room full of naked boys.  Oh, that was a great one, Nelson. Salvation in a little boy's mouth. I'm gonna post that one for sure.  Yeah, well, I used to think that about church when I was a kid too. Hey, don't say things like that, Stan! You wanna go to fuckin' Hell?  Hang on! Hang on! I gotta post this! This is hilarious!  Four boys and a priest playing a board game! Nononoait, let me get the picture.  Aw shit, I missed it! Hey, mornin' Mackey! Ah, doin' better, huh, Josie? All right.  It's not open. Hey! Hey, it's nine o'clock! Hey!  Hey...  Well this sucks. What are we supposed to do without church? Shut up, Shelley! What's it all about, huh? Are we just bags of carbon and water put on this planet for no purpose? You're born, you die, then you're just... food for the worms. The church is back open?  Hey! What uh, what are you guys doing? Last week? No, he was at my house a couple of days ago playing board games with the boys. Boring  Father!  Hey, hey Sharon, it's Father! He's back! Hey, Father's back! Oh uh, no. I haven't seen, Butters. Or Stan. But Father, please, we all need church. Please, Father, we're all lost, and the cleanup crew hasn't helped at all.  Stephen! Stephen, listen! The boys are missing! Fr. Maxi thinks they've been taken by the other priests!  But seriously, we have to find these guys! The boys are in danger! What-what'd she say? Can, can I post that? Yeah I'll bet.  Kind of like how getting raped by a Catholic priest is undeserved.  Oh God, it's good to have my faith back!
