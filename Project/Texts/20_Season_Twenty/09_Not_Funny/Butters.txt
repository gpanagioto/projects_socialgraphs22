 He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot.   Going pee! Because you keep on telling everyone she is. Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends!  I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart. That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop. Sure buddy, sure. Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us. The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars.
