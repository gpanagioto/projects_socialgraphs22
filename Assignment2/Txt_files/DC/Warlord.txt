The '''Warlord''' is a [[sword and sorcery]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer-artist [[Mike Grell]], he debuted in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 (November 1975).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=324}}</ref> The titular character, Travis Morgan, obtains the name "Warlord" as he fights for the freedom of the people of [[Skartaris]].

==Development==
Grell described the Warlord's genesis "as a comic strip called ''Savage Empire''... ''Savage Empire'' was born of my admiration for [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' and [[Burne Hogarth]]'s [[Tarzan in comics|''Tarzan'']], combined with my fascination with archaeology and lost civilizations." Grell described pitching his idea to DC Comics: "I completely revised the concept from ''Savage Empire'' into ''The Warlord''. The story of an archeologist who stumbles through a time portal and winds up in Atlantis became the story of US spy pilot whose [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]] is damaged while on a mission over Russia and plunges through an opening at the North pole into the world at the center on the earth, where creatures of from mythology and Earth's ancient past co-exist amid fantastic cities and leftovers of the civilization of [[Atlantis]]... drawing on many sources, including my own US Air Force experiences to lend a note of authenticity to the characters background. Choosing the new setting was easy, as a kid one of my favorite books was [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 classic ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', I [also] drew on...''[[The Smoky God]], The Hollow Earth'', and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' ''[[Pellucidar]]'' series."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eury |first1=Micheal |title=Back Issue! |date=2011 |issue=#46 |page=19}}</ref>

There Travis, wielding his .44 [[AutoMag (pistol)|AutoMag]] pistol and joined by Shamballah's Princess (later Queen) Tara, a scantily dressed savage, became The Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer [[Deimos (comics)|Deimos]] as well as various kings.

Volume 4 of the series begins with an explorer finding perfectly preserved [[dinosaur]] remains in the [[Himalayas]]. She takes the head of one to a doctor and an expedition is set up to retrieve more samples. The team is spotted by the Chinese government and flee into the caves after losing several members. They discover a portal and after walking through find themselves in [[Skartaris]] where they encounter Travis Morgan. Travis Morgan is attacked by a giant bird and kills it with the help of Shakira. Refugees enter Shamballah and Morgan discovers that a new god has taken over the Shadow Kingdom and has overrun the Kingdom of Kiro, [[Machiste]]'s homeland. One of the refugees is injured and he surprisingly carries a gunshot wound.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Grell, Mike|penciller= Prado, Joe|inker= Wong, Walden|title= The Warlord|volume= 4|issue= #1|date= June 2009}}</ref>

The machinations of Deimos' return pit Travis Morgan against Tinder. Just as Morgan realizes that Tinder is in fact his son Joshua, he becomes distracted and Tinder mortally wounds him. Travis Morgan's final words were "I thought I'd have more time". Morgan is cremated and Tinder becomes the new Warlord.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Grell, Mike|penciller= Grell, Mike|inker= Grell, Mike|story= Sunset|title= The Warlord|volume= 4|issue= #12|date= May 2010}}</ref>

Joshua Morgan becomes the new Warlord. His costume is reminiscent of Travis Morgan's black outfit when he first arrived in Skartaris. Instead of carrying a sword and a gun as Travis did, Tinder carries a sword, a dagger, a quiver of arrows and a bow.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Grell, Mike|penciller= Hardin, Chad|inker= Hardin, Chad|story= Son Rise|title= The Warlord|volume= 4|issue= #13|date= June 2010}}</ref>

==Other versions==
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' storyline, The Warlord is the pirate of a fleet when he was attacked by pirate Deathstroke in battle stealing their loot. During the battle, The Warlord's crew was killed while he escaped using the hovercraft.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jimmy Palmiotti|Palmiotti, Jimmy]]|penciller= [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Bennett, Joe]]|inker= Dell, John|story= Separation Anxiety|title= [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager]]|issue= #1|date= August 2011}}</ref> Later, The Warlord plans to attack Deathstroke and retrieve Jenny Blitz who has been in stasis since she was stolen from him. The Warlord ambushed Deathstroke and his fleet and demanded that they surrender. In answer Deathstroke shot The Warlord's right eye using a scoped sniper rifle. He had been aiming for his mouth. Deathstroke fired at The Warlord's ship again, and it unexpectedly blew up. Each ship in Warlord's fleet subsequently exploded. The ships were destroyed by Jenny Blitz, now released from her stasis tube due to an earlier skirmish between Ocean Master and Icicle, one of Deathstroke's crewmen. Jenny appears to be able to project explosive force from her hands.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Palmiotti, Jimmy|penciller= Bennett, Joe|inker= Shasteen, Tony|story= Red Tide|title= Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager|issue= #2|date= September 2011}}</ref>
