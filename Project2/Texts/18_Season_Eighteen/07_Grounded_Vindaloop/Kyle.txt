''Coup de grah'', Cartman Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized! You should probably listen to him, dude.  Maybe we are.  Hello? Again? Uh huh. Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now. You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?  Fuck you! Get up, Cartman! Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso?!  You're goin' to the hospital!  Fuck you if you're in on this. Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service. Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset. Kyle. I don't care! You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!  Fuck you! He said they're doing a Total Recall. You haven't done anything yet! We need help! Our friend is in a coma! Hey, Cartman, I need to talk to you. Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible. Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here. Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here. I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me. Www-what do you mean? Fuck you! Don't... do that! NO! I put your headset on, and came here to- No. Then I came into this virtual space. Fuck you! Why would they send ''you'' in to convince ''me'' of anything?! Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there? Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?  Dude... What? Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality? Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then- Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset. God damn it Cartman! He's lying. Why not? Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!  We're right here dude. Do you remember now? We're here, dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this. Alright, dude, take off the headset.  Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
