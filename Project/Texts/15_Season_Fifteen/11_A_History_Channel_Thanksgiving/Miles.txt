How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?! You Indians took me to thy planet, and then cast me here! Why?!   Hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die?! Tell me, Indian! Hold your lying tongue!  Ah, he was not.  I have been told of your expertise, Kyle of DeVry Institute. I need your wisdom to get back to my planet. Into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me!  This is Natalie. We shall make camp here for the night. On the morrow perhaps we can reach Cape Cod. And Thanksgiving may yet be saved.  What is wrong with Kyle of DeVry Institute?  I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on. It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world. HA! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over. You can't believe what everyone tells you, Kyle. You have to open your eyes.  Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death! I trust none but them!  Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible! Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving. Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal.  Please, Kyle of DeVry Institute. There is no more time for squabbles. The universe is at stake! Yes! Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!  Now attack their left flank! Good! They're retreating! Hit them with the anti-Indian device!
