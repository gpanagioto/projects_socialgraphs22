So young man, I understand that you and my daughter have started a romance. And I suppose you have a thing for Canadian girls, huh? Is that it? You've got maple fever? I'm sore-y, Charlotte, but I get suspicious. It's bad enough we have to live in America, now all the boys with maple fever are gonna wanna have at our daughter.
