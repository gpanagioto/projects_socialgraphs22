Yeah. We figure that if our boys are gonna be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too. Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has ''your'' sons to be his best buddies! And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend. No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation. Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting! Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend! Here we are, everyone.  Where are Butters and Eric? Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder!  Okay.  We'll meet you boys on the slopes.  It sure is.  What's the red sticker? O-all right! Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company? Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo! Hey look, this chair lift goes right into a building.  I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ''...did...'' just say a thirty-minute presentation. Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office. What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing?
