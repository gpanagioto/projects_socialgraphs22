  The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over. Ya see?  We swear it, on the cross. Take them into custody!  Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone! Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross!  It is what Christ would've wanted! Kill him! He goes against the Church. He must die! You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them!  You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies! Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later. My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier!  Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit!  Why won't you go away?! Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
