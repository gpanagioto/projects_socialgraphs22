That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it? Wuh what'd I do? Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny had a will? That's... really touching. Oh my God!  Kenny! You're alive! He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP! He did not! Did not! Cartman! Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!  That dirty no-good sonofabitch! How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate? Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in! Yeah, come on!  We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain! You say tomato, but I say Kenny! Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace. Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons. Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone.
