You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends ''in'' to Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started. Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me! Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon. Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged? Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain. Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest. Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran. Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy! Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax. Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs. Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax. I'm from Iraq. No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world! Nothing! Relax, brother. Oh, really?  Pray that I don't change it any further. He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion. Eh! Who are you? Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see. Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one. Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say? No, no, relax there, fella! Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking. You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as "New Baghdad!" Qoloh Qalah! You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!! And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem... Or you will be stabbed in the head! Hey!! What the hell is this?
