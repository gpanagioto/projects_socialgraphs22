==Fictional character biography==
===1970s===
Agatha Harkness was introduced as the [[governess]] of [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin Richards]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=144}}</ref> She easily fended off the [[Frightful Four]] when they came to abduct Richards, and admitted to the [[Fantastic Four]] that she is a [[Witchcraft|witch]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #94. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=26}}</ref> She then aided the Fantastic Four in battle against [[Annihilus]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #109-110. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Through the actions of her son [[Nicholas Scratch]], she was revealed as a member of the previously unknown New Salem, Colorado, a colony of witches of whom she had been the leader. Scratch had taken control of the town and persuaded its inhabitants that Agatha betrayed the community's secrets by working for the Fantastic Four. She was abducted and taken back to the community with Franklin to stand trial.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #185. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Fantastic Four followed and came into conflict with the [[Salem's Seven]], Agatha's grandchildren fathered by Scratch. The Fantastic Four defeated them and freed Agatha. In the process, Scratch's evil was revealed to the community of New Salem and he was banished to another dimension.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #186. Marvel Comics.</ref> Agatha became the magical tutor for the [[Scarlet Witch]] in the use of witchcraft.<ref>''The Avengers'' #128. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Scratch and Salem's Seven returned, and Agatha foiled their attempt to conquer the world.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1980s===
Eventually Salem's Seven took over the New Salem community again. They captured Agatha and killed her by burning her at the stake, though Agatha soon made her presence known to Wanda in what appeared to be a post-death astral form. In an ensuing battle between the Scarlet Witch and Salem's Seven, the entire community's energies were drawn into Vertigo of the Seven, who lost control of them. Wanda managed to capture some of the energy and funnel it away, but the entire town was destroyed. Following hints from Agatha's astral form, Wanda channeled the remaining energy to become pregnant with twin children of [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], her android husband.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Agatha resurfaced, again alive and well, when Wanda's infant children began exhibiting odd behavior (disappearing for brief periods of time) and Wanda became unstable after her husband's dismantling; Agatha provided no explanation for her return.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #51. Marvel Comics.</ref> After [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] claimed that Scarlet Witch's children were actually fragments of his own soul and reabsorbs them, Agatha briefly mind-wiped Wanda's memory of her children in an attempt to help her deal with the trauma. Agatha later restored those memories soon after when Wanda became a pawn in a complex plot by [[Immortus]]. Agatha aided the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their battle against Immortus.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #60–62. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2000s===

[[Nick Fury]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] found what appeared to be Agatha's corpse in her home and concluded that Agatha had been dead for a long time.<ref>''The Avengers'' #503. Marvel Comics.</ref> Some time later, a partially amnesiac Wanda tells [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]] she is under the care of her "Aunt Agatha" in a small apartment.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, this version of Wanda was later revealed to be a [[Doombot]] that replaced the real Wanda at some point.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Ghost life====
Agatha has since made her presence known in the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel|New Multiverse]] as a ghost. She appears to Wanda and confirms her death at the hands of her protégé.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> She also concurrently serves as the omniscient narrator of Vision's ongoing solo title, having induced precognitive visions through arcane ritual involving the murder of Ebony at some undetermined point before her death.<ref name=autogenerated1>''The Vision'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Agatha fights alongside Wanda and the spirit of her biological mother Natalya Maximoff against a physical manifestation of Chaos which is attempting to destroy witchcraft. The two spirits channel their magic through Wanda and, after [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] is summoned, they manage to defeat the being once and for all although this has gravely wounded Order, the Goddess of Witchcraft. Natalya sacrifices herself to restore Order and, in doing so, also returns Agatha to life. Despite noting that her and Wanda's paths are intertwined, Agatha chooses to have some time to herself to enjoy being alive again.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2020s===

====Daughters of Liberty====
Agatha Harkness later appears as a member of the Daughters of Liberty where she taught magic to its members.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Agatha later briefed the Daughters of Liberty's latest recruit [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] about the situation involving [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] having [[Sharon Carter]]'s soul.
