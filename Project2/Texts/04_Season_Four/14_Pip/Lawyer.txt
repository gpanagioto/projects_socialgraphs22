Joe, the blacksmith? I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip. Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice.  I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires.  Do you still object? He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman. There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous. OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood? Then you will go to London in a week's time.  Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned. Then I should take my leave.  You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this? I should think not.  On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow.
