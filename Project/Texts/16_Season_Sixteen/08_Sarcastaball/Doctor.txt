Uh hum. Mmm.  I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage. You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain. Oh, really? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball?  That's fascinating. Please, go on. You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains. Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say "Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain."
