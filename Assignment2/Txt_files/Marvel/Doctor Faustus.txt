==Publication history==
Faustus' name comes from the [[Faust|famous character]] of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s Renaissance play ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'' about a man who sold his soul to [[Lucifer]] in exchange for 24 years of service from a devil called [[Mephistophiles]] in order to gain all knowledge. This character predates the Christopher Marlowe play, in the legend built around the real-life [[Johann Georg Faust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Fictional character biography==
Johann Fennhoff was born in [[Vienna]], Austria. He became a psychiatrist and criminal mastermind.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=198}}</ref> He has proclaimed himself the "Master of Men's Minds", and is known for the use of psychological methods of combat. His plots typically involve manipulating his foes into positions where they will, essentially, kill themselves.{{issue|date=May 2017}}

===1960s===
In his first appearance, Faustus induced nightmares and hallucinations in [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) in an attempt to drive him insane. However, he was easily bested in a physical confrontation.<ref>''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #107 (Nov. 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=132}}</ref>

===1970s===
It was later revealed that Faustus had been treating the amnesiac [[Peggy Carter]], and captured Sharon Carter and Sharon's parents in an attempt to destroy Captain America.<ref name="Cap162">''Captain America'' #161-162 (May–June 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref> Faustus, with the help of [[Karla Sofen]] then acquired stolen weapons from Stark International with which he planned to threaten New York City, and organized a private flight of American criminals; however this plan was thwarted by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #192 (Dec. 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Faustus is briefly able to control [[Spider-Man]] and use him in an attempt to introduce a "psychogenic additive" to a flu vaccine (which would permit hypnotic control of the public), but he is defeated.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #170 (July 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Faustus is the mastermind behind the neo-Nazi group [[National Force]], directing them behind the scenes. He is responsible for the creation of the [[Grand Director]] to lead the National Force, as well as brainwashing [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent Sharon Carter and programming Sharon to commit suicide, though Carter survives. Faustus also temporarily brainwashes Captain America and battles the latter and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. His legs were injured by falling gas canisters during this confrontation.<ref>''Captain America'' #232-236 (April–May 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1980s===
Faustus later mentally conditions [[Everyman (Marvel Comics)|Everyman]] to be his operative, later known as Zeitgeist. He used his absorbascan to draw in psychic power from other people in an attempt to mentally defeat [[Mister Fantastic]] and prove his worth to the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. Everyman subsequently battles [[Spider-Man]] and Mister Fantastic, but they defeat him. When Richards subsequently seeks Everyman's backer, Faustus attempts to attack Richards psychologically by using elaborate androids to foster the illusion that Richards has killed the rest of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Richards sees through the ruse and causes Faustus himself to have a breakdown.<ref name="MTU133">''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #132-133 (Aug.-Sept. 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After recovering from his breakdown, Faustus then allies with the [[Red Skull]], and aids in the villain's mansion. Faustus unsuccessfully attempts to coerce Captain America into committing suicide through the use of ghostly holograms.<ref>''Captain America'' #326 (Feb. 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2000s===
Faustus is presumed dead for a number of years, but reappears, living undercover as a S.H.I.E.L.D. psychiatrist, employed by the Red Skull. He is tasked with manipulating [[Sharon Carter]], and claims responsibility for Sharon's increasing romantic attachment to [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #22 (Nov. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> Faustus is responsible for manipulating Sharon Carter into assassinating Captain America following the 2006 storyline "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]".<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #25 (April 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> It is further revealed that the [[Grand Director|Captain America]] from the 1950s is alive and in Faustus's possession, recuperating slowly, and reconditioned to be an agent sent to attack the new [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] (Bucky Barnes). The failure of this attack, and the ever-increasing verbal abuse of Faustus by the Red Skull and [[Arnim Zola]], causes him to withdraw from the project, but not before freeing Sharon and giving crucial information about the Red Skull's plans to S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #40-41. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===
Rogers, [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] are instrumental in exonerating Barnes when the latter is tried for the crimes committed as the Winter Soldier, in light of the mind control to which Barnes was subjected.<ref>''Captain America'' #612. Marvel Comics.</ref> This is done in part with Faustus's testimony in the trial, and a demonstration of his mind-control abilities, which he displays by manipulating the prosecuting lawyer into attacking the judge.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

Faustus is later revealed to have established a [[real estate development]] business based in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] called Hope Yards Development Relocation Association, as a front for a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] cell. The cell's purpose is to implement Faustus's plan to market energy drinks and aerosol sprays laced with mind controlling nanomachines.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[G.
