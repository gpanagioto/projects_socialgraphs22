Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened! Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!  Yeah! This is so tits! Oh, I mean, this is so cool! Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard!  Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!  Aren't you stoked?!  For one tooth. Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits. Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under ''my'' pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast. All we need is teeth.  Sega Dreamcast?  Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits! I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because ''your'' family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny. How are we gonna get it from him? Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha. Higher, you guys.   I am the tooth fairy, my child. Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow.  Ey! Do not open your eyes until morning.  Square in the nuts. Bull's eye! I love that song, Mom. Sing it again. Okay. Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy. I know, huh? You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean- Four dollars.  Do you what this means? Tih-  What the hell? Mom! You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!  M- Mom? Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy? How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face? How can I trust you?  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.   There is no money. I know!  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.  My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money. But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Kyle, open your eyes, man! Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy. No, man, that's just a TV show. What? That your parents lied to you, too? How? Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat ''Oprah'' tits right there! Yeah.  Wow, look at the size of these houses! Hey,  Got it.  What the-?  Yeah! You ripped off our idea! It's better than ''your'' dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare! We were there first! Man, that is tits! Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see... Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent- Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang.  That's right. Keep the change, my man. Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit? Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family! Sure, Kyle. So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.  How much? Can I ask you a question, Weasel?  Do you think I'm an idiot? These are ''cat teeth'', you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  What?! I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you!  Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!  Will somebody take those books away from him? Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.  Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!  I got it! Kyle? Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face. ...Tits.
