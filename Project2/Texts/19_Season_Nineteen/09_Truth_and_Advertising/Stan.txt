No, I don't.  Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this?  It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up. You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you? What's that supposed to mean? That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together! You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him?  I think it was Vermont. That's an ad for skiing in Vermont. Just click out of it. That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar. Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can-  Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that. Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing. Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing? But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him. Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing? No. That's not what we set out to do. No, we didn't. Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid. Why are you looking at me? Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed? He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he-  Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal. I don't know. My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle! Don't you dare call me a Cartman! Fuck you, Kyle!
