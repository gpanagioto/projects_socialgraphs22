Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?  Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny? I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you "Ghostbusters sucked balls" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person. A traitor? Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff! Yeah. Neither did I. You can't stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong. You are smart, Heidi.  You're funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I seriously lose my shit. Yes, Heidi. For the first time I'm really scared for the future. Heidi? Heidi! Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's really important. Heidi, we... have to get to Mars. No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now.  I've seen what's gonna happen when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it's going to be very bad. Humankind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the people who go to Mars, where there's no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody said or did on the Internet, ever. Yes.  Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know that I'm doing this to save... us. That's kewl. We aren't gonna see home again, babe. We're gonna make it. There's no turning back. Yes. I do.
