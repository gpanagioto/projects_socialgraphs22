That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one! But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?  Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph! I'm a Paladin, Cartman! Quick! A monster of Rivendell!   The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish ''The Lord of the Rings'' returned to them. Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest! Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like ''Lord of the Rings''.   Butters, what the hell are you doing?!  Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us! This copy of ''Lord of the Rings'' made the young Butters behave quite oddly. Oh, crap, the sixth graders! You can't keep it.  Dude, that video ''is'' making people act strange. We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape. Hide!  Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed. Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do.  We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... ''The Lord of the Rings''. This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.  Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.  Paladin! We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.  We were almost killed. Hey, what are you guys doing?   You guys. Somebody is following us. Butters? Jimmy, are you sure? They're gonna take ''The Lord of the Rings'' from us. Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost. Oh brother! No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before. Oh no! They're closed! Finally.  It's over. Butters! No!  It has to go back!  Let go of the tape, Butters! Fine!  Middle-earth is again safe.
