Let a man take a crap!  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper. Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.  Why?  Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive. This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller. Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys! Hey, this is ''all'' of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere.  Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere. Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it. Bring it, bring it!   Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih. Date-rape psychosis. Awesome! We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children! Yes! Go away, you stupid towel!  That's... so... cool! It's Monday? What, dude?  Come on, man, this isn't funny!   No! ...No! Hey, towel! Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh! No it isn't. No it isn't. Egh! This is where you came from? Goddamnit! Can we ''please''... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?! Alright, I think we go over there.  You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time! I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid! Yeah, and you're a towel! We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we? Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level. Could you turn it up? Hup hup. Come on, hang on.  Kenny! Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there! Hooray! You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
