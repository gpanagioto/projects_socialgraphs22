The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony. Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe? Huh? As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary. It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava. And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity. Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome? Oh my God! What has he done?
