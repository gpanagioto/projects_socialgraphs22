She is depicted as a smart, snarky classmate of [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', and becomes his love interest in the sequel ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', a unique aspect for original characters within the MCU franchise and upon [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' feature films]] preceding it.<ref name="Geek"/>  She returns in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), helping Peter, Ned, and [[Doctor Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe character)|Doctor Strange]] to capture multiple villains that have entered their universe from the multiverse.

The character's full name is Michelle Jones-Watson, which was first revealed in ''Spider-Man: No Way Home''.

== Portrayal and characterization ==
[[File:Zendaya by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Zendaya portrays the character in the MCU.]]

MJ is portrayed by actress [[Zendaya]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as a classmate of Peter Parker at [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown School of Science and Technology]] and a teammate on the academic decathlon team.

== Fictional character biography ==
===High school life===
{{Further|Spider-Man: Homecoming}} 
In 2016, Michelle, commonly known as MJ, is introduced as a student at [[Midtown High School (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Midtown School of Science and Technology]] and enjoys mocking her classmates, including [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]. She is given the opportunity to take over from the departing [[Liz (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Liz]] as captain of the Academic Decathlon Team, and begins to open up more with teammates, such as [[Ned Leeds (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ned Leeds]] and Parker. She begins to consider them as her friends.

=== Resurrection and school vacation ===
{{Further|Spider-Man: Far From Home}}
In 2018, MJ is killed in [[The Blip]],{{efn|During the events of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018).}} before being restored to life in 2023.{{efn|During the events of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).}} In 2024, MJ attends the school sponsored trip to Europe, where her affections are sought out by Parker and [[Brad Davis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brad Davis]]. When she deduces Parker's identity as Spider-Man, MJ helps discover [[Mysterio (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mysterio]]'s fraudulence, by exposing him to [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]] (actually the [[Skrulls (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skrulls]] [[Talos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Talos]] and [[Soren (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Soren]] in disguise) as the one who staged the [[Elementals (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Elemental]] invasion. Shortly after their trip to Europe, MJ and Parker begin a relationship, and have their first date by swinging in the city, when ''[[TheDailyBugle.net]]''{{'s}} [[J. Jonah Jameson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|J. Jonah Jameson]] releases a [[fake news|doctored video]] of Mysterio and Spider-Man sent to him by Mysterio's associates, claiming that Spider-Man is responsible for the Battle of London (during which Mysterio was killed) and exposing his identity as Parker.

===Multiversal invasion===
{{Further|Spider-Man: No Way Home}} 
After Parker is framed for the murder of Mysterio, MJ and Parker head back to Parker's aunt and caretaker [[May Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|May]]'s house to escape the press. She is eventually interrogated and taken to custody by the [[Damage Control (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Department of Damage Control]] along with May, Parker, and Ned. Attorney [[Matt Murdock (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Matt Murdock]] gets Parker's charges dropped, though MJ, Parker, and Ned become infamous, resulting in all their college applications being rejected. In response, Parker consults with [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] about a spell that would help people forget that he is Spider-Man, which Strange casts for him, but the spell is corrupted when Parker makes changes to the spell after Strange has begun casting it in order to exempt his loved ones from it. As a result, several [[List of Spider-Man enemies|Spider-Man foes]] from other universes who know Parker is Spider-Man arrive and attack him as a result of this.

MJ and Ned help Parker track down three of these individuals. After they find out that Strange intends to send them straight back to their realities to certain death, Parker objects and after a struggle, takes the box containing the spell in addition to Strange's sling ring and placing those under MJ and Ned's care, as he opts to restore the villains to their human forms. After learning of May's death by the hands of [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Norman Osborn's]] alter ego Green Goblin, MJ and Ned uses the sling ring to try and locate Parker but instead find an [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|alternate version]] of Parker (later code-named "Peter-Three") in one attempt and [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|another one]] (later code-named "Peter-Two") in another attempt. Ned and MJ find a bereaved Parker on a rooftop and go to comfort him. They then introduce him to his alternate selves, who also comfort him and provide advice.

In a standoff between the Spider-Men and their villains at the [[Statue of Liberty]], Ned and MJ protect the spell box as the Spider-Men battle their enemies together. MJ falls from the statue after a pumpkin bomb from Osborn detonates on the spell box, destabilizing the spell once more and threatening the fabric of reality. Parker tries to save her but is whisked away by Osborn. She is then ultimately saved by Peter-Three, who had lost [[Gwen Stacy (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|his own girlfriend]] in a similar situation.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (2014).}} Before long, Strange fixes the spell due to Parker requesting the former to erase the latter from everyone's memory, sending the other Spider-Men and their villains back to their universes and preserving space-time. Parker and MJ confess their love for each other and kiss passionately before the spell is completed, but not before she and Ned make Parker promise to find them. Parker later considers reintroducing himself to both MJ and Ned, but ultimately decides not to.

==Reception==
===Casting controversy===
[[File:Zendaya - 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Zendaya at the ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' premiere in 2019]]
After the announcement of Zendaya's casting, controversy and speculation centered upon the fact that [[Zendaya]], an [[African American]] actress, would be portraying [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref name=HollywoodReporter/><ref name="msnbc">{{cite web |last1=Howard |first1=Adam |title='Spider-Man' Zendaya casting controversy revives racial tensions |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/spider-man-casting-controversy-revives-racial-tensions-n637111|publisher=[[NBC News]]|access-date=September 4, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Media outlets defended Zendaya over the issue, along with the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' film series director [[James Gunn]] and Mary Jane co-creator [[Stan Lee]] on [[social media]].<ref name="The daily beast">{{cite web |last=Yamato |first=Jen |title=Zendaya, 'Spider-Man Homecoming,' and the Beauty of A Black Mary Jane |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/zendaya-spider-man-homecoming-and-the-beauty-of-a-black-mary-jane |website=The Daily Beast |access-date=September 4, 2020|language=en|date=August 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name="msnbc"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Tilley |first=Steve |title='Spider-Man: Homecoming': Stan Lee endorses Zendaya as Mary Jane Watson |url=https://torontosun.com/2016/08/23/spider-man-homecoming-stan-lee-endorses-zendaya-as-mary-jane-watson |website=[[The Toronto Sun]]|access-date=August 23, 2016 |language=en |date=August 23, 2016}}</ref> Zendaya responded to the rumors of her character as Mary Jane by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in an interview saying: <blockquote>"Whenever we were on set, one of us gets some random character name [on the call sheet]. [Bloggers were] like, "Oh they must be so and so." And we just crack up about it, because it's like, 'Whatever you want to think. You'll find out.' It's funny to watch the guessing game. But of course there's going to be outrage over that because for some reason some people just aren't ready. I'm like, "I don't know what America you live in, but from what I see when I walk outside my streets of New York right now, I see lots of diversity and I see the real world and it's beautiful, and that's what should be reflected and that's what is reflected so you're just going to have to get over it."<ref name=HollywoodReporter/> 
</blockquote>

Zendaya also confirmed that despite the confusion, she is "100% Michelle" and not Mary Jane as many had speculated.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Crystal |title=Zendaya Says Her Spider-Man Character Is '100 Percent' Michelle, Not Mary Jane |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/video/3010948/zendaya-spider-man-michelle-not-mary-jane/ |website=MTV News |access-date=September 4, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> However Michelle is revealed to be nicknamed "MJ" in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming|Homecoming]]'', by which she is known for the entirety of ''Far From Home'', while her full name is revealed to be Michelle Jones-Watson in ''No Way Home'', though she says she goes by Michelle Jones.
