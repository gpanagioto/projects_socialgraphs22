We know, Cartman! Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write? Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers. I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself! What? Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit! No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!" Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing. You know what, Cartman? I believe you. Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags!
