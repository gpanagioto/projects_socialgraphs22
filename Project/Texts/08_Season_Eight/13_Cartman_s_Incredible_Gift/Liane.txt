Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Oh, what's wrong with him? Coma... My God, fo- for how long?  Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle! You're doing so much better, muffin. Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again. His new... powers? Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy. Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you. Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives.  Oooh, I'll go make some tea. Oh, goodness! What's going on? O-o-o-o-oh!  Is it over?
