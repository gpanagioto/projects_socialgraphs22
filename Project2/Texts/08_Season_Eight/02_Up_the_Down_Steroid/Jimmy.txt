Hey fellas.  Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.  Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events. Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year. S-s-six! S-s-s-ssseven! S-s-seven!  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven reps. Oh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.  Oh he-hey, N-Nathan.  Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training ''really'' hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away. What kind of shortcuts? S-s-ss-s-s-steroids?  ...But aren't those illegal? So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work? How much would this cost me?  Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a performance. Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second!    N-no, Dad. Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy. Oh. Sure thing. Come on in. Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week. Dad, Jesus C-Christ! You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving. I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag? Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.  Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy! Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them! You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you? Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it! Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.  Fuck! Grrrr! Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.  Come on, push it! Push it!   The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.  Oh Jesus!  P-push it! Push it! They-they're all just... jealous.  You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!    Top athlete, yeah! Yeeessss!  Yes! Yes!  Yeah! Yeah!   Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater! What?  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?   Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a
