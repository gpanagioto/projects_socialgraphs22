Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left! There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined!   Stupid towel!  A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.  Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.  Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
