 Cool. No way. It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture. No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over! Stop it! Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman! She's ''not'' eating it, it's just coming out her backside! Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman! God dammit!  Cartman, will you stop this gayness?! That's not what I meant! Can we go now, please?! Stop it, Cartman!  ...What? No! Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson. Good. Aw, God-dammit! That does it. I'm out.  Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing! I hate you.  Come in.  So stop doing it! You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here! Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe! I can see your lips moving! See?! I just saw your lips move! Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?! Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say,  "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!" YES, dude!  Out!  Oh Jesus.  Oh no, no, no. Stop. It.  Dude, who the hell is Mitch Conner?  All right, I guess it's possible.
