'''Blok''' is a [[superhero]] in the 30th century of appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He has a massive, stony body possessed of incredible strength and endurance.

==Publication history==
Blok appeared in ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #253 (July 1979) by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Joe Staton]] in an era referred to as the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Legion of Super-Heroes Teams Through the Ages, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/legion-of-super-heroes-teams-ranked/ |website=CBR |access-date=3 April 2020 |date=27 December 2019}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Blok first appeared as a member of the League of Super-Assassins, where he was manipulated by the Dark Man, a clone of [[Tharok]], into attacking the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref>''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #253. DC Comics, July 1979.</ref> Blok, possibly the last of a silicon-based species native to the planet Dryad, had been convinced by Tharok that the Legion was seeking to destroy his home world, when in fact the Legionnaires were working to save it. When he learned that the Legionnaires were not his enemies, he turned on the Assassins and eventually joined the Legion.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 2 #272. DC Comics, February, 1981.</ref> He knew very little of the rest of his race; it was not even clear to him whether his form was that of an adult or a child.

Blok was relatively slow to acclimate to life in the Legion, though he eventually forged a close bond with two of his teammates, [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]] and the [[White Witch (comics)|White Witch]], the latter with whom he spent a great deal of leisure time perusing the Legion's voluminous archives. He remained with the team for several years, eventually choosing to leave following the catastrophic Black Dawn affair and the increased scrutiny and suspicion of Earthgov towards all Legion activities. He eventually found his way to the [[Puppet Planetoid]], where he spent a few years in isolated contemplation. Shortly thereafter [[Polar Boy]] officially disbanded the Legion of Super-Heroes.

In 2994, Blok's former teammates [[Cosmic Boy|Rokk Krinn]] and [[Chameleon Boy|Reep Daggle]] began to reorganize the team, a move which immediately attracted the attention of the corrupt Earthgov. In order to discourage and demoralize the new effort, the alien [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]] who had been secretly controlling Earthgov for years hired [[Roxxas]] to seek out and kill Blok as a warning to his other teammates. Roxxas tracked Blok down to the Puppet Planetoid and carried out his mission with ruthless efficiency, delivering Blok's dismembered corpse to the ranch home of [[Lightning Lad|Garth]] and [[Saturn Girl|Imra Ranzz]] on Winath.<ref name="LSHv4n3">''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 4 #3. DC Comics, January, 1990.</ref> Far from demoralizing the other Legionnaires, however, Roxxas's act galvanized them into action, and it was directly following their discovery of Blok's murder that the Legion of Super-Heroes was officially refounded.

At the moment of his death fighting Roxxas, Blok seemed to have an [[out-of-body experience]] in which he was back on Dryad, and met [[Strata (comics)|Strata]] of [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], who he recognized from mythology. Strata promised to finally show him the truth of his ancestral history as she led him below ground into a series of caves. Filled with joy, the gentle, philosophical Blok's last thoughts were of finally reaching enlightenment.<ref name="LSHv4n3" />

===Post-Zero Hour===
Blok did not appear in the post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] Legion. A female Dryadian named '''Brika''' was introduced in ''Legionnaires'' #71 (May 1999), protesting a group of colonists who intend to re-settle her hibernating clan. She was then possessed by a stone elemental named '''Rrox''', who destroyed the planet, thinking "no-one will ever colonize Dryad now".

Blok appears briefly (with several other Legionnaires from previous iterations of the team such as [[Tyroc]] and [[Dawnstar]]) as a character in a 'campfire story' showing the Legion's influence, and the urban legends and myths that have sprung up around it.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 5 #15. DC Comics, April, 2006.</ref> This appearance was a cameo, and does not appear to take place in the series actual continuity.

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
Blok, along with many other pre-Crisis Legionnaires, appears as a statue in [[Superman]]'s [[Fortress of Solitude]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' vol. 2 #5. DC Comics, June, 2007.</ref> He also appears as a member of the Legion in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" storyline.

In ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #2, Blok rescues Mysa from [[Mordru]] on [[Sorcerers' World|Zerox]], being aided in the rescue by [[Dawnstar]], Wildfire, and Rond Vidar. It is revealed at this point that Blok and Mysa are in a relationship, one that was only briefly hinted at as Blok's unrequited crush in the pre-Crisis Legion. Blok helped combat the [[Legion of Super-Villains]] until he suffered major injuries at the hand of Mordru. To save him, Mysa absorbs Mordru's magicks, becoming the '''Black Witch''', and leaves the Legion for the Sorcerer's World when the battle is over. Once his wounds are healed, Blok follows Mysa, and convinces her to let him help her use Mordru's black magic for good.

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]", Blok is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members that appear in the present after [[Doctor Manhattan]] undid the experiment that erased the Legion of Super-Heroes and the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12 (December 2019). DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Blok's abilities fluctuated during his career. Though his enormous size and rocky form suggested super-human strength and near-invulnerability, he did not demonstrate such abilities during his first appearance. Rather, he seemed able to absorb various sorts of energy attacks, being specifically immune to [[Lightning Lass|Light Lass's]] anti-gravity powers. In his second appearance, this was specifically stated to be an ability to increase his own mass. This power seemed not entirely under his control; when he joined the Legion, it was stated that three Legion flight-rings were required to lift him. Why his teammate [[Colossal Boy]] (who could also increase his mass and size) could make do with a single flight ring, but Blok could not, was never explained.

During Blok's Legion tenure, it was stated definitely that he had massive super-human strength. Its relative limits were never made clear; it was stated that he could not match the levels of pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] [[Superman|Kryptonians]] and [[Lar Gand|Daxamites]] or [[Ultra Boy]], but seemed stronger than [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]] and, possibly, Colossal Boy. Contrary to this, his durability was greater than that of the latter two heroes, though still not quite on Kryptonian levels. This may have been contradicted when he was able to hold his own against pre-Crisis Daxamites hand-to-hand during a Darkseid led invasion of the United Planets during the [[Great Darkness Saga]] in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 2 #294. His recuperative abilities were likewise vague. In his earliest experiences, his body included a collar-like formation around his neck which was destroyed during the [[Great Darkness Saga]] and never regrew, but he seemed unharmed by its lack. A formation on his face that resembled a nose was likewise apparently chipped away.

Blok was also written as having the ability to communicate telepathically with other silicon-based life forms. Despite his searching, he never did find any, so this ability went unexplored.

Over time, his earlier abilities to change his mass and absorb energy were de-emphasized in favor of his super-strength. Towards the end of his life he began to mutate into a different form, larger than before and possessed of several protuberances which expelled energetic plasma from time to time. It was speculated that Blok's earlier form had been an immature, possibly larval state, and the changes in his body were actually a metamorphosis like that of a butterfly. Another supposition was that he was reaching maturity and beginning to show signs of that race's indication that he was male. A 20th century Dryadian, [[Strata (comics)|Strata]] of [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], metamorphosed into a diamond-like version. When asked about the metamorphosis, she replied: "I guess that means I'm female".

==Equipment==
As a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] he is provided a Legion Flight Ring. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. His ring was modified to handle the increased mass of Blok as he originally has to wear three rings due to his massive size.

==In other media==
* Blok appeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Far From Home". He and the rest of the Legion of Super-Heroes were mind-controlled by the Fatal Five to attack the [[United Planets]].
* Blok has appeared four times in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' animated series in small cameos or crowd scenes in which he has no lines. The cancelled third season of the series would have given him a more major role.

==Reception==
Jesse Murray of [[Syfy]] placed Blok as the 33rd greatest [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] member of all time describing him as "once a misguided bad guy who saw the light".<ref name="Legion">{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Jesse |title=Every Member of the Legion of Super Heroes, Ranked: #49-1 |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/every-member-of-the-legion-of-super-heroes-ranked-49-1 |website=SYFY WIRE |access-date=3 April 2020 |language=en |date=12 January 2016}}</ref>
