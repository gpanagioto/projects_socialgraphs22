Stan's house, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are in the living room playing video games.

Kyle

HA! I killed you!

Stan

HA, I blew your head off!

Kenny

(Aw, Goddamnit!)

Stan

Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?

Kyle

Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?

Cartman

Let a man take a crap!

Stan

Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.

Kyle

Hyeah, that poor, poor thing

Stan

Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!

Cartman

[from behind the bathroom door] I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? [finishes wiping his butt and zips himself up. He comes out of the bathroom with something in his hands] You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.

Kyle

Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?

Cartman

Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.

Sharon

[walks in with a basket of laundry] Are you guys still playing that video game?

Stan

Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.

Cartman

[holds it up] Look. [Sharon gasps and drops the laundry. Cartman unravels it] But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. [looks through it]

Sharon

Eric, put that down!

Cartman

Why?

Sharon

Just go put it back in the trashcan!

Cartman

[inspects it] Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.

Sharon

No that... that came from me; just put it away.

Cartman

This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! [hick accent] You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.

Stan

[looks up at his mom] What is it, Mom?

Kyle

Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?

Sharon

Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing. [game play stops and the boys look at her] I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.

Stan

The 2001 Okama GameSphere?

Sharon

Sure.

Kyle

Cool!

Cartman

Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!

+++++


Luau's Toys, day, later. A banner reading "WE HAVE GAMESPHERE" hangs over the window, and the console itself is in the window display.

Stan

There it is. The Okama GameSphere. [the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console]

Kyle

Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.

Stan

What's that?

Kyle

Don't know, but it kicks ass. [they watch as Sharon buys the console from Mr. Harris and he wraps it up and delivers it to her] Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.

Cartman

Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. [the boys turn away from the window]

Stan

Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. [checks his watch.] It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!

Kenny

(Woohoo!)

Kyle

Awesome! [suddenly remembers] Oh, crap.

Stan

What?

Kyle

I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.

Stan

Dude, we got GameSphere.

Kyle

I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. [a strange character walks up next to them]

Towelie

Don't forget to bring a towel. [it's a walking, talking towel]

Stan

What?

Towelie

When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."

Stan

...O-kay.

Kyle

Thanks, Towelie.

Towelie

[after a few moments of silence] Do you wanna get high?

Stan

No. [Towelie looks for a few moments, then walks away]

Kyle

Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.

Cartman

Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.

Sharon

Here you go, boys. [Stan takes the shopping box and the boys take off]

Boys

AAAAAA.

+++++


Stan's house, later. In the living room, Kyle finishes connecting the GameSphere to the back of the TV

Kyle

Okay, turn it on.

TV

"Okama GameSphere"!

Boys

Whoa!

TV

[the game title comes up] Thirst For BLOOD!

Cartman

Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.

Kyle

Oh, this is so cool.

Cartman

Bring it, bring it! [on the TV two monsters fight each other. The one on the right attacks the other with a chainsaw. "Oh!"]

+++++


Stan's house, night. The boys have been playing for hours. Around them are empty boxes of Cheesy Poofs and cans of Zoop soda. On the sofa is a bag of chips. Stan's parents walk up to the boys.

Sharon

Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.

Stan

G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.

Cartman

[slowly slides into a hick accent] Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.

Randy

What?

Sharon

Nothing. Come on, Randy. [whisks him off to bed. From the TV: "Twenty kills."]

+++++


Stan's house, Sunday morning, dawn. The boys have stayed up all night playing video games. Kyle is on the phone with his parents.

Kyle

Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- [to Cartman] wha-what is it?

Cartman

Date-rape psychosis.

Kyle

Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. [hangs up] I don't have to go outside!

Cartman

Awesome!

Kyle

She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..

Stan

Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!

Cartman

We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!

Stan

Well, it's alright. We can still play for [looks at his watch] six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.

Towelie

[walks in from nowhere] Don't forget to bring a towel.

Kyle

Uh no.

Towelie

When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."

Stan

Okay, we will.

Towelie

[raises its arms in victory] Alright! [lowers them, then after some moments] Do you wanna get high?

Kyle

No we don't wanna get high!

Towelie

Okay... You sure?

Cartman

Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! [Towelie goes away]

Stan

Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!

Cartman

That's... so... cool!

+++++


Stan's house, later... The boys have repositioned themselves and look half-asleep from all the game play. Doughnuts and ice cream appear - a cone is on the rug with its ice cream melting. Sharon walks up to them again.

Sharon

Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.

Stan

No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.

Sharon

No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.

Cartman

It's Monday?

Stan

Oh, uh, I'm sick.

Kyle

Me too.

Sharon

No, you're not sick. Now get to school. [disconnects the console from the TV] All of you.

Stan

But Mom...

Sharon

Go!

Boys

Aagh!

+++++


Bus stop, moments later. The boys are now waiting for the bus.

Stan

Can't believe we have to go to school!

Kyle

Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.

Stan

We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. [a green car pulls up in front of them. Two soldiers are in it]

Commander

Hello, boys, how are you?

Stan

Fine.

Commander

Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere.

Kyle

What? You mean Towelie? [the two soldier look alarmed. The passenger quickly gets on the radio]

Commander

Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at... [checks his map] Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado! [the men look at the boys]

Cartman

What, dude? [the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.]

Stan

This is gonna be one looong-ass day. [Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.]

+++++


Stan's house, Monday afternoon. The boys arrive there from the bus stop

Stan

That was the longest day of school ever!

Kyle

Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! [the boys burst in and head for the television]

+++++


Stan's house, living room. The boys stand in from of the television

Kyle

Where is it?

Stan

It... it was right here.

Kyle

Where the hell is it??

Cartman

Come on, man, this isn't funny! [Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman look around and behind the TV] I need my fix! [the phone rings, and Stan goes to answer it.]

Stan

Hello?

Voice

If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel. [the boys gather to wait for Stan]

Stan

What? Who-who is this?

Voice

Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else! [in the background: "Okama GameSphere!"]

Stan

Don't hurt it! [Click. Stan then hangs up]

Kyle

What? [Stan turns around]

Stan

They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.

Cartman

[in disbelief, backs up.] No! ...No!

Kyle

Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!

+++++


South Park, sunset. The boys walk down Main Street.

Stan

Towelie!

Cartman

Hey, towel!

Kyle

Where the hell is he?

Kenny

(I don't know. Where could it be?)

Stan

I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.

Kyle

What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.

Cartman

Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. [the others stop, and he calls out in one direction] Gebaayybeh! [then in another] Gebaayybeh!

Kyle

That's a towel call?

Stan

This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.

Kyle

Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.

Stan

Hey yeah. [goes into the street and clears his throat] Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! [looks around. So do the others] Aaah. Let's go take a shower! [all look around] Let's go waterskiing!

Towelie

[walks up] Don't forget to bring a towel.

Kyle

There he is!

Towelie

Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. [Stan walks over angrily and takes Towelie's left hand, and pulls him along].

Stan

Come on, dude! [the others follow]

Towelie

Where are we goin'?

Kyle

Just come on! It's getting dark.

Towelie

Are we gonna get high?

+++++


Outskirts of South Park, night. A full moon shines down on the boys as they reach the gas station

Kyle

Are you sure this is where they said to be?

Stan

They said the gas station outside of town.

Towelie

Well, I'm gonna get a little high. [A high-powered light comes on]

Man

Hold it! [ten men stand in the light. Some of them wear red berets]

Stan

Who is that? [squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same]

Man

Step... away... from the towel! [the boys do so, and an official steps forth]

Official

There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you.

Towelie

If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.

Official

It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you.

Stan

'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.

Official

Your what?

Kyle

Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!

Official

I don't know what you're talking about.

Stan

You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.

Official

Omigod! [shrieks] IT"S A TRAP!! [gunfire strikes him and kills him. Behind the boys soldiers pop up in the hills and continue firing]

Man 2

Cover! Cover! [the officials and their personal security force fire back, and the light is knocked out]

Stan

Goddamnit, what now?!

Official

Run, towel! [a grenade lands between two guards and blows up, shredding them to bits. The boys just look on]

Stan

[disinterested] Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. [leads the others away]

Soldier 1

Where's the towel?!

Soldier 2

It can't be far! [two more soldiers come up, and others move along behind them] Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!

Guard

[coughs up blood. The boys arrive] Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!

Stan

[grabs the guard by the lapels and throttles him] Where is our Okama GameSphere?

Guard

Get the towel home [cough] They will explain everything. Please, hurry! [coughs up blood once more, and dies]

Kyle

Aw, God-damnit!

Stan

Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?

Towelie

What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.

Stan

Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. [they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements]

Commander

Well?

Soldier

They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air.

Commander

Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. [gets pensive] They must have some unexplainable bond with it.

Soldier 2

Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T. [the commander looks at him annoyed, and he leaves]

Commander

It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B.

Soldier 3

You mean...?

Commander

Yes. [camera zooms in] Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. [fade to black]

+++++


A desert, later that night. The truck rolls along... Stan steers, Kyle, Towelie, and Cartman ride along. Kenny mans the pedals

Kyle

Are we getting close?

Towelie

I think so.

Stan

A little more gas, Kenny. [Kenny presses down on the gas pedal]

Kyle

How long has it been since you've been back there.

Towelie

I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.

Cartman

No it isn't.

Towelie

Is!

Cartman

No it isn't.

Towelie

Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.

Stan

Brake, Kenny, brake. [Kenny brakes, and Stan steers the truck to the right to go down the dirt road. Towelie moves to the window]

Cartman

Egh!

Towelie

M-maybe it's down that dirt road.

Stan

[sighs] Dude, don't you remember where it is?

Towelie

I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high. [pulls out a joint...] then I'll remember where it is. [lights the joint and puffs deeply. The boys watch him as his eyes get bloodshot.]

Stan

Alright, so where is it?

Towelie

Where's what?

Boys

Agh!

Kyle

The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! [Towelie simply snorts]

Stan

Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! [Kenny brakes angrily and the truck jerks to a stop] Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!

Towelie

Well calm down.

Kyle

That's it! [takes the joint] You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!

Towelie

That's my last joint, asshole!

Kyle

I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!

Towelie

Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.

+++++


A purple house, night. Inside, in the restroom, a woman washes her hands and face, then pulls a towel out of its rack to dry herself

Woman

Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil. [some strange sounds are heard outside the door] Kevin, is that you?

Soldier

Harris! Reach bang and clear!

Woman

Hello? [the bathroom door flies open and five soldiers pour in, firing away] WAAH! [she falls to the ground quick] Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod! [she covers her head]

Soldier

Alright, it's clear! It's clear! [the soldiers leave the restroom. The woman gets up and checks herself for bullet wounds and finds none. She turns to see the wall behind her. The towels on their rack are shot through with holes. She blinks, confused]

+++++


a backyard. Mrs. Tweak pulls down some clothes she's had drying on clotheslines. As she nears the towels, three soldiers rush in and start firing away at them

Soldiers

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! [Mrs. Tweak leans out of the way, watching her towels get shot up.]

Soldier

Let's go let's go! [The soldiers finish their job and walk away. Mrs. Tweak straightens up]

+++++


A men's gym shower, night. Mr. Garrison is in the shower with two other men. He finishes and wraps a white towel with blue stripes around his waist, then walks towards his locker

Soldier

Get it!

Mr. Garrison

What the? [two soldiers rush over and make him face the lockers. One of them pulls off his towel]

Soldier

Throw it down! [the soldier throws it down]

Mr. Garrison

Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! [the soldier stabs at the towel twice, then directs another soldier to fire away at it. The other soldier shoots at it while the other two watch]

Soldier

Alright, let's go! [the soldiers leave]

Mr. Garrison

Huh where are you goin'?

+++++


The truck the boys are driving pulls up in front of a gleaming glass building with "TYNACORP" above the entrance, and the boys pour out with Towelie

Cartman

This is where you came from?

Towelie

Yeah, I think so. [gets woozy] Oh man.

Stan

What?

Towelie

I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. [the group goes around the fountain and goes inside]

+++++


Tynacorp, inside. The boys walk down a long passageway

Research leader

Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.

Stan

Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?

Kyle

We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.

Research leader

Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth

Stan

We don't care.

Research leader

You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.

Stan

Dude, we don't care.

Research leader

Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.

Stan

We... don't... care.

Kyle

All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?

Research leader

Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.

Kyle

Who's they?

Research leader

Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.

Stan

[dismissive] Don't care, don't care, don't care.

Research leader

Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.

Cartman

Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!

Research leader

I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at "their" base.

Stan

Can you tell us where "that" is, please?

Research leader

You mean to go right into their base? [thinks] Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.

+++++


Secret Government Base, night. Inside, various military officials man a command center. Two soldiers walk up to the commander and salute him

Soldier

Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!

Commander

Ah yes. [salutes back, and all three men lower their arms] Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?

Sgt. Masters

Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.

Commander

Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this. [the two sergeants look at each other]

Sgt. Boll

Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles.

Commander

Hmm... [taps his pointer on the strategic map] So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!

Sgt. Masters

Oo we...

Sgt. Boll

He must have outsmarted us, sir.

Commander

Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!

+++++


The night sky. Clouds float by overhead, past the full moon. A helicopter flies into the sky and the camera follows it. Two officials prepare the boys for dives into the military base as the research leader talks

Research leader

In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.

Kyle

Okay.

Research leader

[rolls up to Towelie] I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks.

Towelie

That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.

Research leader

Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you.

Stan

We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?

Guard

Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?

Stan

Yeah. [the boys join Towelie and all go to jump from the helicopter]

Guard

Go go go go! [one after the other, the four boys and Towelie jump off, and then the helicopter leaves. Stan is the first to pull his parachute string, and the others follow. Soon they're all next to each other, floating down. Stan sighs]

Kyle

Dude, I figured it out.

Stan

What?

Kyle

If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!

Stan

So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?

Kyle

Seven and a half.

Stan

[getting impatient] Hurry up, stupid parachute!

+++++


Secret Government Base, night. The boys land silently and start walking

Cartman

Alright, I think we go over there. [the Secret Government Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching the gate]

Towelie

[at the security entry pad] Let's see. [types in some numbers] No. [touches his lips with his right index finger, trying to figure out what to type next]

Stan

Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.

Towelie

Hey it's been a long time!

Cartman

You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!

Towelie

[faces Cartman] Don't preach to me, fatso!

Cartman

I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!

Towelie

You're stupid!

Cartman

Yeah, and you're a towel!

Towelie

You're a towel! [Cartman has nothing more to say, and Towelie hops off the box towards the boys] Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.

Stan

Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! [gives Towelie the joint] Here's your stupid lighter. [tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.]

Towelie

Hold on. [hops on the box and types into the entry pad again.] Wait a second [presses a few buttons] That's it!

Kyle

That's it?

Towelie

Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town." [starts playing the melody on the keypad] Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town. 

Stan

No, Towelie, the entry code!

Towelie

[turns around] For what?

Stan

God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.

+++++


Secret Government Base, night, inside. The boys climb over the fence and sneak past a soldier without arousing suspicion. They end up at the genetic research building

Kyle

Well let's look in here. [opens the door and leads the others in. Before them are cylinders of liquids, each with a floating deformed clone of Towelie in it. They come across a Towelie clone drying under a heat lamp]

Towelie Clone

Kill... me... Kill... me.

Towelie

Oh my God! No-o-o-o!

Commander

[enters with four soldiers, who quickly get set to fire] Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.

Towelie

[turns around with the boys] What are these things?

Commander

Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid.

Towelie Clone

Kill... me.

Stan

Do you have our Okama GameSphere?

Commander

You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.

Stan

Oh God, don't care, don't care.

Commander

[pacing proudly, solemnly] Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. [the boys show no interest.]

Soldier

Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.

Kyle

What terrifying secret?

Commander

That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!

Cartman

We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?

Commander

Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. [his voice begins to deepen] Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know.

Kyle

And we don't care.

Commander

You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.

Stan

So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.

Commander

Oh yes. It has been all along.

Soldier

Can I kill the towel now, sir?

Kyle

Go ahead. [the boys move away quickly]

Commander

No, wait. [stays the weapon] Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. [zoom in on a tiny camera close to Towelie's lower border. Officials back at Tynacorp's command center are looking at the live feed] You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all.

Stan

But we don't care!

+++++


Tynacorp command center. The officials gather around the research leader

Official 1

What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!

Research leader

The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.

Official 2

We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!

Research leader

Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. [presses a button. A door with "GS-401" on it slowly spins around. A towel rack appears and a mean-looking buff towel hangs from it]

GS-401

[deep voice] Don't forget to bring a towel!

+++++


Tynacorp, outside. Shadows appear in the brush across the way. The commander is there with his troops, the boys, and Towelie

Commander

Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. [hands a disk to Stan] Then upload this encryption disk into their computers.

Stan

We're just going in to get our video game back.

Commander

If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. [hands it to Kyle]

Kyle

Photon rifle, whatever. [the boys enter Tynacorp with Towelie.]

+++++


Tynacorp command center. The boys walk through the center slowly

Stan

Hello? Hello, anybody here? [GS-401 hops down from the rafters]

GS-401

Welcome to the party, boys! [flexes and rushes Towelie] HAAARRRHHHH!! [the two towels wrestle a bit]

Towelie

Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.

GS-401

HAAARRRHHHH!! [Kyle fires the photon rifle and knocks the beefier towel away with the beam. The research team and security force pour into the room angrily]

Research leader

So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?

Commander

[he and his troops pour in another door] Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! [the two forces face each other, with the boys and Towelie in the middle] Don't make a move, you bastards!

Research leader

Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children.

Commander

Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.

Research leader

Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!

Stan

Ohmigod, look! [in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it]

Kyle

Our GameSphere! [the boys each get a controller and activate the GameSphere: "Okama GameSphere"]

Stan

Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. [behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play]

Research leader

[turns to look at the boys] You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!

Commander

Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!

Cartman

Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.

Kyle

Sweet!

Commander

[now facing the research leader] But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar! [pulls at the research leader's head and the face comes off. Under it a green fish-alien head appears]

Stan

Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!

Zytar

Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.

Commander

[looks at the boys] And now you know the horrible truth, boys.

Zytar

Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! [fires a gun at the commander. Both sides begin to fire at each other and there are casualties on both sides. Zytar and two guards slowly back away and out of view]

Cartman

Could you turn it up?

Commander

Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out! [the boys continue playing their game, so the commander comes up and reaches for the encryption disk in Stan's pocket, then goes away. Towelie sits on the floor with a huge bong, getting high. The commander reappears across the room moving towards a red button] I think I can get it from here, boys!

Zytar

[returns] What are you doing? You'll kill us all!

Commander

Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings. [inserts the disk and a huge explosion blows the boys out of the room.]

Boys

Oooww! [Then it blows out the roof and some sides of the main building, and the boys find themselves hanging from Towelie, above a boiling tank of acid]

Cartman

Hup hup. Come on, hang on. [Stan and Kyle moan]

Stan, Kyle

Whoa.

Kenny

(Help help! Heeelllppp!) [loses his grip on Kyle]

Cartman

Kenny!

Kenny

(Nooo!) [falls into the acid tank, disintegrating and sinking. Kyle looks on, but next to him is the GameSphere]

Kyle

[sees it] Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! [above him, Stan watches large pieces of metal fall to the ground]

Stan

Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! [Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere]

GS-401

[walks in on an adjacent catwalk and sees Towelie with the boys hanging] What are you doing?

Towelie

Get away from me, you evil towel!

GS-401

Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them.

Towelie

No way! They're my friends!

GS-401

They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now.

Kyle

[swings closer] I've almost got it!

GS-401

You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. [holds out a joint. Towelie looks at it longingly] Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!

Stan

[feels Towelie slip] Aw, crap!

GS-401

You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high.

Towelie

You asshole.

Cartman

Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!

GS-401

Come, Towelie! Make your decision!

Towelie

I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! [Stan is shocked at the answer. Towelie stretches enough to take a puff while holding on to the boys, then slips enough for Kyle to succeed]

Kyle

I got it! [grabs the GameSphere. Towelie pulls himself and the boys up to the catwalk in front of a door. An explosion behind GS-401 sends it into the air]

GS-401

Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [floats down into the acid and disintegrates]

Stan

Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!

Kyle, Towelie

Alright!

Cartman

Hooray!

+++++


Stan's house, night. The boys are gathered before the TV playing their Okama GameSphere with a new player: Towelie.

Stan

Oh, dude, we finished level 50!

Kyle

Awesome!

Towelie

Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

Kyle

Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.

Stan

Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.

Towelie

[heavily slurred] Don't forget to bring a towel. [the boys laugh]

Cartman

You're the worst character ever, Towelie.

Towelie

I know.

+++++
