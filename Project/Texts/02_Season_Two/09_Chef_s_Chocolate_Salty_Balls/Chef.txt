Hello there, children! Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a ''mint!'' They're little cookies, with ''fudge'' in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems". I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems." And I've also got my ''double'' chocolate cookies, "Fudge This." Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge." Huh? Whose goose? Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!" Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls." Try 'em.  It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me! I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. There's nothin' we ''can'' do. Just sit here and suck on my balls. Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.  Well, uh-I kinda hope not. I mean, ''sure'' it does. Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven. Come on, let's go. My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him! You're daaamn right. Well, it worked once before.
