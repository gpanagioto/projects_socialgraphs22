It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone.  Sergeant! What have you got, Larson. Alright, keep an eye on all three of them. If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man. What have you got? We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting. Yeah, we've heard of that.

You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I ''can'' guarantee you. You won't care who's checkin' your Twitter account then.
