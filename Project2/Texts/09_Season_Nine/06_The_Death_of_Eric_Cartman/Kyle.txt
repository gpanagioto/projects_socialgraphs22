God, this is gonna be sooo yummy. She's here! I want some!  All right, let's eat Colonel!  The skin's the best part... You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time! Hello?? I've been saying this for years! Yes, but he ''thrives'' on that. That sounds great! Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow? Thanks.  We're ignoring him. Because he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath! There ''were'' no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself! It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him. He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle. We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
