== Depiction ==
The character was portrayed by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] in many anthology pages as the "Ghost Detective", a private investigator who specializes in cases involving the supernatural. Siegel and Shuster then left the character for the more popular [[Superman]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> 

The character was then revised in September 1985 in the ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' series comic books by [[Roy Thomas]] and was utilized many times by the author as afilliated by the superhero team.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The fictional character's origin was revealed in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #17. (August 1987) by E. Nelson Bridewell and Roy Thomas. They depicted him and his partner Rose Psychic being slated as human sacrifices at the hands of a demonic cult, but were rescued by a shadowy group called "The Seven". The two were later trained in the use of occult magics themselves. Thirty-six years later, Doctor Occult opened up his own detective agency, specializing in crimes of a mystical nature and during [[World War II]] he joined the All-Star Squadron. At some point, he and Rose become fused into one being. Doctor Occult has used sorcery to halt or greatly slow the aging process, so that he appears in modern comics to still be a man in his late thirties or early forties, even though he was born at the end of the 19th century.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Doctor Occult of Earth-Two appearances|url=http://www.mikesamazingworld.com/mikes/features/character.php?page=appearances&characterid=5 |website=www.mikesamazingworld.com |access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>

He also appeared within the crossover storyline, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref name="CBR"/>

In 1991, [[Neil Gaiman]] brought the character back into the spotlight with a prominent supporting role in ''[[The Books of Magic]]''. In the third issue he acts as [[Timothy Hunter|Tim Hunter]]'s guide to otherworlds. When visiting [[Faerie (DC Comics)|Faerie]], he transforms into Rose. Tim learns many important things from Dr. Occult, while nearly being trapped in the realm of the fae. This journey is meant to guide Timothy on the role to his becoming the most powerful magician of the current era. The other guides on this mission are [[Mister E]], the [[Phantom Stranger]], and [[John Constantine]], the last of whom sarcastically nicknames the group the [[Trenchcoat Brigade]]. The four would return later at a summons from Timothy, who, having lost everything at that point, needs a new direction in life.<ref name="vert-ency">{{Cite book | last=Irvine | first=Alex | author-link=Alexander C.

Later stories would continue the idea of Occult and Rose Psychic being one with two different origin stories given to explain how they became one person.<ref name="CBR"/>

Dr. Occult/Rose plays a vital role in the [[Day of Judgement (comics)|Day of Judgement]] series and storyline as told by [[Geoff Johns]], he is depicted as one of the [[Sentinels of Magic]], a group created to prevent artifacts such as the [[Spear of Destiny]] falling into the wrong hands.<ref name="CBR">{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=John |title=10 Things Everyone Forgets About DC's Dr. Occult |url=https://www.cbr.com/dc-doctor-occuilt-forgotten-facts-comics/ |website=CBR |access-date=24 August 2020 |date=16 December 2019}}</ref>

The fictional character then appears as a main character in the backup story by Keith Giffin in the ''Reign in Hell'' mini-series where he enters [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] in order to find [[Rose Psychic]].<ref name="CBR"/>

===The New 52===
In the reboot he is depicted as the keeper of the [[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]] and was killed off in ''Justice League Dark'' #12.<ref>''Justice League Dark'' #12</ref>

===Powers and abilities===

==In other media==
* Doctor Occult appears in the role-playing video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' and in the puzzle game ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]''.

==Reception==
Bill Reed of [[Comic Book Resources]] praised the character saying that [[DC Comics]] could portray more of him despite him not having the staying power as other supernatural heroes such as [[Phantom Stranger]] or [[John Constantine]].<ref name="Reed">{{cite web |title=365 Reasons to Love Comics #84 {{!}} CBR |url=https://www.cbr.com/365-reasons-to-love-comics-84/ |website=www.cbr.com |access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>
