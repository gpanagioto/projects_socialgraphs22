Dude, it's ''Terrance & Phillip''. But everybody watches ''Terrance & Phillip''. Ow! What the hell was that for?! Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own. Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna. Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all. But won't your grandpa be there? Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help? I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance. Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it? Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman! Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. What are they doing in there? Yep, all done. Yeah, stupid! Well, it, it looks like... Why is Death coming after us? What are we gonna do? Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids. Totally dude. Quick, jump through the window. Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you! Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!! Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment? Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
