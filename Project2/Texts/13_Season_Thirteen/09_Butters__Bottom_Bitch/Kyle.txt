So what? Butters, I think you should reconsider this. Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special. Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money. You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp!  Butters, I really think we should talk. Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong. Butters, what's happened to you?
