'''Mysterio''' ('''Quentin Beck''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is primarily depicted as an enemy of the [[superhero]]es [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. While Mysterio does not possess any superhuman abilities, he is a former [[special effect]]s artist, [[illusionist]] and actor who uses his talents to commit crimes. He is a founding member of the supervillain team the [[Sinister Six]].

The character has appeared in numerous media adaptations, including [[feature film]]s, [[television series]] and [[video games]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Background and first appearances===
Quentin Beck is a [[special effect]]s wizard and stunt man working for a major Hollywood studio with dreams of making a name for himself in the film industry. However, he came to see his career in special effects as a dead-end job. His attempts to become an actor were poorly received, but he realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective criminal. In his first battle with Spider-Man, after he frames Spider-Man for robbing the Midtown Museum, Mysterio obstructs the hero's spider-sense with gas and dissolves Spider-Man's webbing with a chemical abrasive. However Spider-Man tricks Mysterio into revealing he robbed the museum, then Spider-Man revealed he had captured it on tape. Mysterio was then jailed, blaming Spider-Man for his ruined career.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #13">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mysterio later joins the [[Sinister Six]] in an attempt at revenge on Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=241}}</ref> In an elaborate scheme, [[Doctor Octopus]] gives each member of the Sinister Six a card with the location of the next battle written on it. Each location was carefully selected to best suit that member's particular talents and Spider-Man will have to fight them one after the other. Only once Spider-Man has defeated each opponent, will he be able to obtain the card that will identify the next location. Doctor Octopus believed that with this plan, each of the Sinister Six would weaken Spider-Man a little bit more so that his chances would grow slimmer after each battle. When Spider-Man reaches Mysterio, his third opponent, he is immediately attacked by a group of highly developed robot replicas of the [[X-Men]] controlled by Mysterio. After successfully defeating the robots and Mysterio, Spider-Man gets the next card that enables him to go on to battle the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Further appearances and decline===
[[File:Quentin Beck.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618 (March 2011 [[Marvel Comics]]). Artwork by [[Marcos Martín (cartoonist)|Marcos Martín]].]]
Mysterio later creates the alias of world-renowned psychiatrist '''Dr. Ludwig Rinehart''', using technology and [[hypnosis]] in an attempt to make Spider-Man lose his mind, and nearly convincing him to unmask himself, though ironically Spider-Man was helped by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] suddenly bursting into the house. Spider-Man then unmasked Mysterio.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio then establishes a brief partnership with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in a plot to kill Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] on a Hollywood movie set by pretending to enroll them in a film. However they were both defeated and arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He threatens to destroy the city while on TV, and goes on to convince Spider-Man he is {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=}} tall using a post-hypnotic suggestion and a miniature funfair, but Spider-Man sees through the illusion and captures Mysterio yet again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #66–67. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While Beck is incarcerated, his cellmate Daniel Berkhart briefly becomes Mysterio on the original's behalf.<ref name="AMS141">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #141–142. Marvel Comics.</ref> Out of prison, Beck resumes his Ludwig Rinehart identity to manipulate Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] into revealing the whereabouts of a lost fortune hidden in her house.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #198–199. Marvel Comics.</ref> Beck used bogus alien disguises to frighten May Parker into revealing the location of the fortune, but then learned that the money had long ago been eaten by [[silverfish]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #50–51. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his next appearance, Mysterio tricks Spider-Man into believing that he had caused the death of a bystander.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #311. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio then attempts to scare the tenants from an apartment complex in a real estate scam thwarted by the preteen superhero team, [[Power Pack]],<ref>''Power Pack'' #55</ref> much to his later humiliation. He is recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to form the second Sinister Six, and battles Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335–339. Marvel Comics.</ref> In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200. Marvel Comics.</ref> and made deals with demons from [[Otherplace|Limbo]].<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly beaten by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired. Eventually, he began to lose credibility as a supervillain, with his defeat at the hands of Power Pack being a particularly humiliating moment.

===''Guardian Devil'' and death===
After his final imprisonment during the ''[[Guardian Devil]]'' storyline, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live, but this imminent death caused prison psychiatrists to grant him an early release.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Obsessed with exacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he was disappointed when he deduced from newspaper articles that the current Spider-Man was just a [[Ben Reilly|clone]] and saw no dignity in overpowering a 'copy' of the real thing (even though by then, the clone had been killed and the current Spider-Man was indeed the original).<ref name="Dv2#1-7">''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #1–7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], whom he had encountered recently during an insurance scam that the hero had thwarted; Mysterio believed that he had found a 'kindred spirit' in Daredevil, in the sense that both were [[wikt:second-stringer|second stringers]] with little reputation outside their homes.<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

After the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] gave Mysterio all the information he possessed about Daredevil's past, Mysterio developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane using a special designed drug to influence Daredevil's mood, presenting him with a baby girl and conflicting reports that she was the second coming of Christ or the [[Antichrist]], with the drug rendering Daredevil violent if anyone suggested that the child was innocent.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the course of the scheme, [[Karen Page]] was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after Mysterio had convinced her that she was suffering from [[HIV]] due to her time as a [[pornographic actor|porn star]],<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Matt Murdock's partner [[Foggy Nelson]] was framed for murder after cheating on his current lover,<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell.{{clarify|date=January 2019}}<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

However, Daredevil's will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and once [[Doctor Strange]] discovers and magically removed the drug from Daredevil's bloodstream, Daredevil unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain's helmet in fury and revealing his now languishing appearance. Beck had thought Daredevil would kill him upon discovery, which in his eyes, was a "grand way to end his final show". Daredevil denied him this and instead dismissed Mysterio's scheme as a basic 'B-movie' plot and calling Mysterio a 'human Xerox', incapable of having an original thought in his life; if nothing else, the Kingpin had already attempted to drive Daredevil insane and he had used the 'supernatural intruding on our world' idea in a previous attack on [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Broken in every sense of the word, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from [[Kraven the Hunter]], pulled out a gun and shot himself dead. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, this act was apparently legitimate, as Mysterio literally had nothing left to live for.<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

===Resurrection===
[[Image:Mysterio02.png|150px|Mysterio unmasked in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #12. Art by [[Todd Nauck]].|left|thumb]]
Sometime later, Quentin Beck suddenly appears in the Midtown High School auditorium in a dark red version of his costume during the three-way battle between Spider-Man and the two successor Mysterios. He confronts Francis Klum before leaving him for Berkhart to deal with. Quentin Beck then confronts [[Miss Arrow]], revealing that half his head is missing from the gunshot wound and explains that, having gone to Hell for suicide, his "superiors" in the afterlife sent him back to Earth to maintain a cosmic balance. His superiors want Spider-Man to continue working at the school and Beck knows Miss Arrow has a similar role for the "other side". Berkhart and Klum briefly battle one another before Spider-Man captures Berkhart. While trying to escape, Klum runs into Arrow and tries to take her as a hostage, only to be stabbed by one of her stingers. He then teleports away, badly bleeding.<ref name="FNS-M11"/><ref name="FNS-M12"/><ref name="FNS-M13"/> Neither Berkhart nor Klum have been seen since. Though Berkhart was incarcerated, Klum's status is uncertain. In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581, a flashback shows that, prior to his suicide, Beck had been hired by Norman Osborn to fake his son Harry's death.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Spider-Man Enter-the-Gauntlet Mysterio.jpg|145px|Mysterio returns in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' Art by [[Marcos Martín]].|right|thumb]] -->
Mysterio reappears during ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, which re-introduces several past Spider-Man villains with new twists. This Mysterio claims to be a returned Quentin Beck who had faked his death, though it's unclear how this fits in with his aforementioned appearance. He is under the employ of Maggia crime member Carmine, creating androids of various deceased Maggia (including their dead leader [[Silvermane]]) to give them a credibility boost in their gang war with [[Mister Negative]]. Beck controls the Silvermane robot himself and plants seeds of rebellion in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], who had left the Maggia under the belief that Silvermane was deceased. He also tries to drive Spider-Man mad by making him think he's accidentally killed several gang members, while trying to convince him that a returned [[George Stacy|Captain George Stacy]], who claims to have always been the gangster known as the [[Big Man (Marvel Comics characters)|Big Man]], also faked his death years earlier. This turn makes Spider-Man realize that Mysterio must be behind the recent mysterious return of so many deceased individuals, and he vows to have Mysterio pay for making it personal. Shortly after, Mysterio uses the Silvermane robot to murder Carmine in an attempt to secretly seize control of the Maggia and its fortune. Spider-Man eventually exposes and confronts Mysterio, who flees. He later runs into [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], who tells him that he has some friends who are "dying" to meet him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618–620. Marvel Comics.</ref> The "friends" Chameleon was talking about happens to be the Kravinoffs. He was present at the ritual where Spider-Man is seemingly sacrificed in order to revive [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Mysterio is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains' team where he is promised that he will receive a reward.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio went after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. He manages to trick Spider-Man into giving him the child by projecting an image of Avengers Mansion and uses his illusions to try to frighten Spider-Man. Ultimately, Spider-Man recovers the baby from Mysterio after figuring out the villain's involvement.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio is next seen as part of the new Sinister Six organized by Doctor Octopus. He first works with Chameleon to distract Spider-Man and the Future Foundation, faking an attack in the Caribbean by zombie pirates while the rest of the Six steal something from the Fantastic Four's headquarters.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659–660. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also participates in an attack by the Six on the [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Sinister Six launch an attack on the Intelligencia and their new doomsday weapon, Mysterio is responsible for taking down the [[Red Ghost (character)|Red Ghost]] and his [[Super-Apes]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Subsequent schemes===
Doctor Octopus and Mysterio later coordinate the Octobots that have infiltrated the Apogee 1 Space Station. When Mysterio notices that some of the Octobots were disabled, Doctor Octopus orders the Octobots to finish their mission and then destroy the space station. Spider-Man, Human Torch and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] later discover that some of the space station's crew members have been taken over by the Octobots making them Octobot-controlled zombies that obey Doctor Octopus' commands.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #680</ref> While in their undersea base, Doctor Octopus and Mysterio discover that their Octobot-controlled zombies have passed out. After Apogee 1 Space Station is destroyed and the crew is evacuated by Spider-Man, Human Torch and John Jameson, Doctor Octopus tells the rest of the Sinister Six that his master plan is about to begin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #681. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although Mysterio aids Doctor Octopus in his attack against the Avengers and his plan to 'heal' the world during the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, he agrees to help Spider-Man, [[Silver Sable]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] defeat Doctor Octopus's plans after Spider-Man convinces him that Doctor Octopus will not honor any deal he has made with the Six as he will almost certainly scorch Earth if his plan succeeds. Mysterio leads Spider-Man and his allies to a Mayan temple where Doctor Octopus's base is located (claiming that he was responsible for the choice of location due to the [[2012 Doomsday Prophecy|supposed Mayan prophecies of the world ending in 2012]]), leaving them to face the mind-controlled Avengers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #686. Marvel Comics.</ref> After disabling the Octobots that were controlling the Avengers, Mysterio lends Spider-Man and Silver Sable his vehicle and provides them with the location of Dr. Octopus' base. He then disappears in a cloud of smoke and leaves the heroes to deal with Octavius.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Men]]'' storyline, Mysterio has crossed over to the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] multiple times only to encounter the mainstream Spider-Man after his last travel. In the struggle, Spider-Man is transported to the Ultimate Universe, where Mysterio reveals that his Ultimate counterpart is simply a [[Life Model Decoy|robotic avatar]] controlled remotely.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Refusing to allow Spider-Man to escape, Mysterio sends a robot avatar after Peter and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|the new Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite using chemical weapons to create the hallucination that both Spider-Men are fighting an army of their greatest foes, Peter's greater experience allows him to focus through Mysterio's illusions and destroy the avatar. Mysterio subsequently departs, reflecting that it is more appropriate to leave Spider-Man trapped in a world where he is dead, leaving [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Iron Man]] to examine his discarded technology.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio is preparing to cement his victory by destroying the portal and trapping Spider-Man in the Ultimate universe forever. But unable to resist the temptation to see how his enemy is faring, he keeps the portal open long enough for Peter and the Ultimates to capture him. Despite his best efforts to throw them off with their worst fears, Mysterio is quickly defeated. Fury decides to keep him prisoner in the Ultimate universe due to his knowledge of Peter's secret identity.<ref name="Men4">''Spider-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later questioned by the Ultimates when [[Galactus]] is accidentally transferred into the Ultimate universe after they determine that Galactus originates from Mysterio's world. Beck reveals that Galactus's past assaults had been defeated by his world's [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]],<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #2</ref> allowing the Ultimates to send [[Ultimate Mister Fantastic|their Reed]] to Earth-616 to hack his counterpart's files on Galactus.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eight months after the events of ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'', Mysterio attacks [[Parker Industries]] with the intention of using the company's Webware technology to cause [[mass hysteria]] by beaming imagery directly into the minds of the product's users. The plot is thwarted by [[Deadpool]], who runs Mysterio over with his "Dead-Buggy".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Joe Kelly|penciller = Ed McGuinness|inker = Mark Morales|colorist = Jason Keith|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe and Jordan D.

===Retirement and return to villainy===
After being beaten by the likes of Deadpool and other superheroes, Quentin Beck left the supervillain business and relocated to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Peter David|penciller = William Sliney|inker = William Sliney|colorist = Jason Keith|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Axel Alonso |story = |title = Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider|volume= 1|issue = #9|date = October 25, 2017| publisher = Marvel Comics|location= United States}}</ref> His daughter Misty Beck shows up in order to persuade him to become Mysterio again.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Peter David|penciller = William Sliney|inker = William Sliney|colorist = Rachelle Rosenberg|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Devin Lewis, Allison Stock, Nick Lowe |story = |title = Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider|volume= 1|issue = #10|date = November 15, 2017| publisher = Marvel Comics|location= United States}}</ref> [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]] shows some awareness of this, as she warns the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] about Mysterio,<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #13</ref> but when Reilly visits the villain, he accepts Beck's explanation that he has decided to retire.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #14</ref> Misty later involves her father in a ritual that would grant her great power if she sacrificed something she truly loved in exchange. But when she attempted to kill Beck, Reilly's intervention distracted her long enough for Beck to accidentally stab her resulting in him gaining the power himself as he places his left hand on the altar while shedding Misty's blood. Now possessing power drawn from [[Cyttorak]], Beck recreates his Mysterio costume and attacks the Scarlet Spider. Scarlet Spider defeats his foe by cutting off the hand that touched the altar, taking away Beck's power.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mysterio later created the illusion of an alien invasion that lured every superhero team to fight them. Spider-Man discovered Mysterio's plot and defeated him. Mysterio stated that he wanted to become more than a lesser criminal as Spider-Man webbed him up for the police. When in court, [[Janice Lincoln]] appeared as Mysterio's lawyer as the vision of an unidentified entity with centipedes on him appeared in the courthouse claiming to be the one who revived Mysterio.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ryan Ottley|inker = Cliff Rathburn|colorist = Laura Martin|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe and Kathleen Wisneski|title = Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 5|issue = #1|date = July 11, 2018|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

In the pages of "Dead Man Logan," Miss Sinister coaxes Quentin Beck into becoming Mysterio again in exchange for keeping him safe from [[Old Man Logan]]. Miss Sinister informed him that [[#Old Man Logan|his counterpart]] tricked Wolverine into killing the X-Men. In order to take over the world, Miss Sinister and Mysterio side with Neo-Hydra.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterio would later find out that Miss Sinister and Neo-Hydra would dispose of him once he has served his purpose.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> This led to Mysterio taking Old Man Logan to Neo-Hydra's base.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the battle between Old Man Logan and Neo-Hydra, Mysterio used an illusion to make Old Man Logan think that he killed him. Quentin then makes his way back to Bedford Hills Psychiatric Hospital while tossing out his Mysterio costume.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dealings with Kindred===
Mysterio is later shown attending a meeting with psychiatrist Dr. Winhorst, where he affirms his old story that he was sent to Hell after his suicide and was released by some [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|demonic entity]] whose name he fears to say. Dr. Winhorst attempts to convince Beck that he actually faked his suicide and his belief in the demon is just his former illness causing him to hallucinate. But when the demon that brought Beck back to life appears in the psychiatrist's office, it affirms that the "demon" is real. When Dr. Winhorst flees, Mysterio begs forgiveness from the entity. Although initially prepared to spare Mysterio, the entity realizes that Peter is somehow witnessing these events in a dream. The entity adopts the temporary alias of Kindred and kills Beck again so that he cannot reveal his identity to Spider-Man before Kindred is ready.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, it is soon established that the 'Mysterio' who died was actually Dr. Winhorst, who was brainwashed by Mysterio to believe that he was the supervillain to give Mysterio a chance to escape from Bedford Hills Psychiatric Hospital. Although Kindred is angered that Mysterio shared his real name with Winhorst to increase the reality of the delusion, he notes that Mysterio keeps running from his purpose and gives him a script to stick to.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

More recently, Mysterio had begun production on a film with Mary Jane Watson on a remote set he used to torment Spider-Man,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #66-67. Marvel Comics.</ref> to make a play for a girl he wronged while under the alias of Cage McKnight.<ref>''The Amazing Mary Jane'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After being discovered by Mary Jane, they cooperated in the project, but the filming was turned tumultuous by the [[Savage Six]] when the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] felt insulted by the "unauthorized use" of his person in the film's plot. Nevertheless, thanks to an authentic recording of their attack, the movie became a rousing success.<ref>''The Amazing Mary Jane'' #1-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Sinister War===
In a prelude to the "[[Sinister War]]" storyline, Mysterio is still in Kindred's servitude as he places Mysterio in Doctor Octopus' latest incarnation of the Sinister Six.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #70. Marvel Comics.</ref> Peter and [[Mary Jane Watson]] are attending the premiere of MJ's new movie which she worked on with Mysterio under the alias of Cage McKnight. Peter is planning to propose to Mary Jane when the movie is over in front of the press and public, but the Savage Six take the opportunity to attack. Mysterio comes to Mary Jane's rescue, exposing his identity to Peter and the Savage Six. Doctor Octopus then attacks the theater with Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Lizard, and Sandman as Doctor Octopus states to Vulture that they need Mysterio. Mary Jane confesses to a concerned Peter that she knew who Mysterio was all along and vouches for him. Mysterio tries to tell Peter that he and Mary Jane's deal with Mephisto is to blame for everything that is presently happening, but Peter is far too distracted by the warring factions. Doctor Octopus offers Mysterio the opportunity to join the Sinister Six as long as he helps them capture Mary Jane. Mysterio complies and teleports away taking MJ with him while promising her that the "devil will get his due".<ref>''Sinister War'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mary Jane is transported to Mysterio's old studios where Beck reveals what happened to him after his suicide, transported to hell, and tortured there until Harry Osborn made him a deal. Taking it, Beck was revived around the time [[Civil War (comics)|Peter's identity was public knowledge]], his adventures in the Spider-Men crossover are referenced, and over time Harry stopped communicating with him until recently. Mysterio also reveals to Mary Jane that he was the therapist who helped her come to terms with Harry's death, but Mary Jane barely remembers this. Mary Jane pleas with Beck, reminding him he's changed, but Mysterio remains loyal to the deal he struck and tells Mary Jane that he knows what fate awaits him. Mysterio rejoins the teams of villains while leaving Mary Jane to the mercy of Kindred.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #71. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed that Mysterio used his time as Mary Jane's therapist to implant false memories of Gwen Stacy confessing to a brief affair with Norman Osborn, thus justifying the existence of Gwen's adult children, Gabriel and Sarah (actually clones created by Harry).<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #74.

Quentin Beck does not possess superhuman abilities, but he is an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master [[hypnotist]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and an amateur chemist and [[roboticist]]. He has extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman, allowing him to engage in combat with Spider-Man despite his foe's superior physical abilities and using his skills at misdirection as a further method of self-defense.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #13"/>

===Equipment===
Mysterio's suit includes many devices to aid him. His helmet is made of one-way [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglass]], meaning he can see out but no one can see in.<ref name="ASM13">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13</ref> The helmet also includes an air supply to protect him from his own gases, sonar to navigate within his mist cloak and a [[holographic]] projector to create 3D illusions. His boots contain magnetic coil springs which allow him impressive leaps as well as the ability to cling to surfaces.<ref name="ASM13"/> Mysterio's costume contains nozzles in the boots and wrists that can release a constant stream of smoke that shields his movements.<ref name="ASM13"/> He can mix other chemicals into this smokescreen for various effects, including a gas that dulls and inhibits Spider-Man's spider-sense, a gas that causes paralysis for 30 minutes, an abrasive that eats away Spider-Man's webbing, hypnogens that make those around him more susceptible to his will and hallucinogens to cause vivid hallucinations.<ref name="ASM13"/> A combination of the hypnogens and hallucinogens, along with his holographic projectors, are how Mysterio achieves most of his illusions. The costume sometimes also includes offensive weaponry, such as lasers or knockout gas nozzles in the eye emblems on his shoulders, or electric coils within his cape to electrocute those who touch it.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

After Quentin Beck, there have been several other characters who became his successors after taking his mantle as Mysterio. The second Mysterio ('''Daniel Berkhart''') was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Ross Andru]] and first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #141 (February 1975). The third Mysterio ('''Francis Klum''') was created by [[Kevin Smith]] and [[Terry Dodson]], and he first appeared in ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' #1 (August 2002), and became Mysterio in the final issue of the miniseries.<ref name="SMBC6">''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'' #6</ref> The fourth Mysterio (an unknown man called "'''Mysterion'''") was created by [[Christopher Yost]] and [[David López (artist)|David Lopez]] and first appeared in ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #22 (June 2013).

===Daniel Berkhart===
After the original Mysterio seemingly dies in prison during an escape attempt, [[J. Jonah Jameson]] hires Daniel Berkhart, a stuntman who had previously worked with Beck, to torment Spider-Man while claiming to be Mysterio's ghost.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=81}}</ref> After he is defeated by Spider-Man, Berkhart explains that Beck had bequeathed some of his equipment to him after his "death", and he felt he owed it to Beck to get revenge. The story leaves it ambiguous whether there is any truth to Berkhart's story or if he was simply covering up Jameson's role in the affair. Berkhart is arrested, despite there being no witnesses to his harassing Spider-Man. He tries to force Jameson to get a lawyer for him by threatening to reveal his involvement to the police, a plot thread which is never resolved.<ref name="AMS141"/>

Later, after Beck's suicide, someone claiming to be Mysterio appears with the revised [[Sinister Six]], making references to his "death", stating how after fighting Daredevil he had exited in a "most spectacular fashion". There was some confusion to this Mysterio's identity until ''Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto'' hinted that it was again Daniel Berkhart. This issue was not addressed again until a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' vol. 3 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Berkhart was later confirmed to be this second Mysterio by Quentin Beck.<ref name="FNS-M12">''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #12</ref> This Mysterio appeared during stories published between the original's death and subsequent return.

The Jack O'Lantern fought by [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] claims to have killed off all of the surviving previous Jack O'Lanterns, leaving Berkhart's status uncertain.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #10–11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Francis Klum===
Francis Klum, a mutant with the ability to teleport, was sexually abused by his older brother Garrison (Mr. Brownstone) and forced to use his powers to assist Garrison's illegal activity as a heroin dealer. When Garrison dosed the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] with heroin and attempted to rape her, Francis decided to stop his brother's cruelty for good, teleporting within and blowing up Garrison's body.<ref name="SMBC4">''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eventually learning the details of Francis' abusive relationship with Garrison and his role in his brother's death, Felicia nearly convinced Francis to turn himself into the authorities; but [[Spider-Man]], believing that Francis was trying to throw  Black Cat from the bridge on which they were talking, brutally attacked Klum. Believing that Felicia set him up, he fell from the bridge, teleported in mid-fall and sustained severe physical injuries, losing his left leg below the knee.<ref name="SMBC6"/>

Hungry for revenge against Spider-Man, he contacted the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and purchased the paraphernalia of the currently-deceased Mysterio (Quentin Beck). He reasoned that by using an old enemy's costume, he could put Spider-Man off-guard; Spider-Man would assume he knew who he was dealing with until Klum demonstrated his powers and it was too late for the wall-crawler to do anything about it.<ref name="FNS-M11">''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, Klum's plans to kill Spider-Man at Midtown High were interrupted when he was stabbed in the chest by school nurse [[Miss Arrow]]'s stingers after an altercation with the other two Mysterios (Quentin Beck having returned from the dead).<ref name="FNS-M12"/> Klum teleported to safety, although Arrow (who was later revealed to be Ero, a being composed of hundreds of spiders) would later state that her stingers were fatal to anyone except Spider-Man.<ref name="FNS-M13">''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Klum later died from his wounds, but was resurrected as a clone by [[Miles Warren (comics)|Miles Warren]] alongside other deceased Spider-Man villains.<ref name="CC2">''Clone Conspiracy'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> This clone of Klum in turn died soon after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/eccc-marvel-spider-man-his-amazing-friends-panel/|title=ECCC: Marvel: Spider-Man & His Amazing Friends Panel|first1=Albert|last1=Ching|date=March 5, 2017|access-date=January 2, 2022}}</ref>

===Mysterion===
An unknown African-American individual purchases the suit of Mysterio from [[Roderick Kingsley]] and calls himself Mysterion. He fights the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) and [[Punisher]]. While keeping Punisher from killing Mysterion, Superior Spider-Man captures Mysterion and places him in containment with Sandman, Electro and Chameleon in his hidden underwater lab.<ref>''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later forcibly put under mind control by the Superior Spider-Man and forced to join his Superior Six superhero team.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mysterion escapes with the other members after being freed from Superior Spider-Man's influence.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mysterion later attacks [[Liberty Island]] with an army of robot dinosaurs, which are defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]] and other superheroes.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|colorist = Rico Renzi and Erica Henderson|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Wil Moss|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 1|issue = #5|date = May 6, 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

* Introduced in the film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', this version is a former [[Stark Industries (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Industries]] scientist who developed holographic technology that [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] showcased in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) and dubbed B.A.R.F. (Binary Augmented Retro-Framing). Angered at Stark for "stealing" his invention, the scientist was fired for his unstable nature. As a result, he swore revenge and joined forces with other like-minded ex-Stark Industries employees to take advantage of the power vacuum left in the wake of Stark's death in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. To this end, they manufactured the [[Elementals (Marvel Comics)|Elementals]] using drones equipped with holographic technology, gave the scientist the alias of "Quentin Beck", and fabricated a backstory for the illusions by claiming the entities and Beck himself were from [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|another universe]].<!--"The story you created of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous, and apparently exactly the kind of thing people will believe right now."--> To build up his reputation and legitimize himself as an "[[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]-level" hero, Beck joins forces with an unknowing [[Talos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Talos]] disguised as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Spider-Man]]—whose classmates gave Beck the "Mysterio" moniker—to "defeat" the Elementals around the world while bonding with the latter to gain his trust and acquire a device Talos gave him on Stark's behalf. Once Spider-Man hands said device, [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#E.D.I.T.H.|E.D.I.T.H.]], over to him, Beck sets about fulfilling his master plan. However, when he learns Spider-Man broke off a holographic projector from one of the drones, he reluctantly decides to kill him along with anyone who could potentially reveal his secret. Using a fight in London between his holographic persona and an Elemental Fusion monster as a distraction, Beck attempts to act on this plan, but is foiled when Spider-Man destroys his drones and retrieves E.D.I.T.H. from him. During the fight, Beck is accidentally shot and killed by one of the drones. Unbeknownst to Spider-Man however, one of Beck's associates downloaded the drones' data and doctored the footage to demonize Spider-Man, reveal his identity, and posthumously make Beck look like a hero before sending said footage to [[J. Jonah Jameson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|J. Jonah Jameson]] of ''[[TheDailyBugle.net]]'' to show the world.
