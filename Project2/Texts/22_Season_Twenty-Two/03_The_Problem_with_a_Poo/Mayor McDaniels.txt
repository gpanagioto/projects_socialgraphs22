People, it's time we faced some hard truths. The town is looking to us for answers, and all we keep doing is burying our heads. We need to cut the budget for this year's Christmas pageant. I've asked the director of the holiday show to stop by so we can all give him the news. Let's just get this over with.  Mr. Hankey, we called you in to let you know that... your Christmas Pageant funding has been cut. By half. We just don't have the support for the Christmas show that we used to. The truth is... some people find you offensive. The decision has already been made. Thank you, Mr. Hankey, and good luck with the show.  We need to talk about what you tweeted! No, I'm talking about what you tweeted last night!  "The city council members are a bunch of pussy-licking Islamists." I'm afraid we have no option but to fire you as executive planning manager of the city council. No goodbyes, Mr. Hankey. You just need to go. We already called you a Poober.
