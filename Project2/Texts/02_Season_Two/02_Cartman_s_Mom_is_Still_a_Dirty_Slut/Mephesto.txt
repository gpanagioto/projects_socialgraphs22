And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room. Gentlemen, the father is...  Where... where am I? Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month. I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life-- Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that ''Terrance and Phillip'' special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing-- Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman.  Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite.  Meaning that she has both male and female genitals. No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis. The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance. Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.
