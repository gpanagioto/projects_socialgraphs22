Bebe, is something the matter?  Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next. I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was ''really'' smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family. Oh, hello, boys. No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait. I believe she is playing "Lambs" over at Eric Cartman's house. Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out. Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers. Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman. Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart.  Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers.   What is it, Bebe?  Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady.  
I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's ''normal'', but if a woman wants to be one, it's wrong.  
How does the school let things like this happen??
