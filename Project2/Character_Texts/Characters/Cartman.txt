I know what it means! I'm not telling you. He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  That's 'cause I was having these bogus nightmares. Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed... ...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room. Then slowly my bedroom door began to open...  ...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway. Weeaak! Then I was lying on a table... ...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes. What? No, it was just a dream, my mom said so. Oh, shut up, guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working. Kick ass.  Huh? Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned! Oh! Oh! No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that? No! Shut up, dildo! Oh! God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream! Shut up! Shut up you guys, it's not working. Heh, somebody's baking brownies.  Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh. Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you. Ow! My ass!  Uh... Ow! My ass! No, that was just a dream. No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.  Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry. Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.  Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger. I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you. Or slip her the tongue. You are making it up. What?  Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh? Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak! Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..! I would if I could, you son of a bitch! Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control! Ah, son of a bitch! You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control. Uh... Hey... Ow!  That hurts, you buttlicker! No! He's not dead. Shut up, you guys. God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!

No, leave me alone mom!   What? Well, that does sound pretty good. Uh, Mom? If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay? Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs. Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.

Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight. I don't wanna. Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?! I'm sick of it! It's completely immature. You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up. Sure, you guys, what-ever. You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens! Oh, God damn it! What the hell are they talking about? You guys, get me down from here! Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos! Puh! Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night. Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.  why don't I have pinkeye then? Ahh, son of a bitch! 
Ugh, I hate those things. Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: "HEY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!"  I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things! Ohh, rain''bows''. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool. Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it. Nothing..! What? Kick ass! Yeah I do, Pop-Tarts are frosted. Oh, you know, this and that. There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid. Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time? You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous. Hey! That kid is me. Me! Eric Cartman! Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish. Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise. If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos? Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap! I can't. I have to go home and get in shape. Screw you, hippie!

Hey, you would taste my pee! Hey you guys. I know a scary story. Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt? Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top. Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body. Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has... No! A piece of celery. Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy. What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink. Hey, it might be! Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell! They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually ''see'' Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow! I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.  Heheh. Those guys are totally scared. Holy crap! What the hell is wrong with you people?! Hey, wait, aah! You guys, it's just me. Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume. You guys, you guys, I was just kidding! Hey, seriously you guys! Hey! Goddammit, don't shoot me! I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now. Help! What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?! Yeah, cartoons kick ass!  
Eh. You're making me sick, dude. No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park. Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester! I'll put a dollar on Sylvester. Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass. Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay. That dog is a gay homosexual. <poem><i>Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.</i></poem> What's homecoming? There he goes again. Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual. ...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television. Ah, dammit! Eeyy! Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-? That's not fair! Stupid puppet. You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass. Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog. Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen. He still looks pretty gay to me. There he goes! No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France. Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass! Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow! Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow! We'll just see about that. No I didn't. That was just my shoes. That's right, you get back there. Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye? Your sister beat you up again, huh? Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass. I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!" Be a man Stan. Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies." That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.  If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"  Yes ma'am. Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this! You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no! Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy! Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"  Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time. It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you. Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl! Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway. Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you. Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings. You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass! Come on Fluffy! UUuuhh. I sure am hungry. Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you! God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass. Gah, French people piss me off. Ugh!... Hey! I'll kick your ass! Whaaat?! I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant. Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again? Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!" I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all. No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this! Kyle no, seriously. No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I... Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts. Fluffy! Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime? Hey! I ain't helpin' crap! I want to eat some paeh. Oh yeah, watch me.  Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison. That'll do pig. 
Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet! That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew! That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss ''Terrance & Phillip'' last night! Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!  Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been? What? Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom! Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss ''Terrance & Phillip'' today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money. Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that? I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off. What! Hey! You piece of crap! I'll kill you! Don't talk about my mom like that! Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch! Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang. Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on! Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer. Oh, biiitch. Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh. Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming. Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again. Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny. Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart. I don't know. Why don't we just shoot him? Aaaah, runrunruuun! Ehh, eh, ehhhh! Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on. You son of a bitch, your mom sucks! Ohhh, God, No! My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool. Yeah! 
What the hell is that thing? There's no such thing as UFOs. Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass. Hey, dudes. It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil. My mom made it, isn't it cool? What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody? Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off! Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage. I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny! I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung! Poor piece of crap. There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh? You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!  Wookies don't live on Endor. What?! What did you say? Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you. Eating Kenny's pudding. Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself. That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool. My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil! Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o. Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!  Could I see that again? That was cool. I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.  I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost! Boo! I'm a ghost. Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad. Hey Chef. Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh? What is that? Who? Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him. Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master. Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking. God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!! Check. Yeah, granola pisses me off. Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny. Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire. I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!! I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate. Hi Wendy. You what?! Are you insane?! How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks? Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy. You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole! Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people! Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too. One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards! Can we have some candy now please?! I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit! Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy! Aaah! It was Kyle. Remember candy, focus on the candy. Eh, shit... You guys, shit... It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now! Hey, there's a pay phone! Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it! Aaah, kew! Finish her dude, she's a zombie now! Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest? Kill her Stan! Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on! Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. Well, let's go home, start eating that candy. Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money. Lehh, eh, screw you guys! 
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on. And ''yeah'', we want Cheesy Poofs! Did you guys see that? That was sweet. Yeah, HEY! That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that? KICK ASS!! When do we get the sports watch? You vas-deferens! I get to wear it first, you guys. Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said. When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out? Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk? I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them! Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling! Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?! Well then, perhaps they ''should'', and decrease the surplus population! I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet? What the hell? Yeah, Starvin' Marvin. Hey mooom? We found a Etheropian, can we keep him? Sweet. No no! He's ''my'' son! I adopted him. Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor. Ahh! Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income. Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too? You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers. This is what you eat ''before'' you eat, to make you more hungry. Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. No Starvin' Marvin, that's ''my'' pot-pie. Oh yeah, you're right. Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here... Yeah, that's right. No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn. No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin! Oh well, back to the poor country with you. B-huh, huh. Yeah, right. Hey, hey, what's going on?! Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?! Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin! Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!

Well, screw you too! What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat. Ah, sweet!

You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!! That's right you will, God-Damnit. Move it POVs, I'm an American! 
Oohhhh! Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas! I'm not fat, I'm festively plump. What the hell is Christmas Poo? Hey! What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow! Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents. Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that. Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now. You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!  Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy. How do ''you'' know? Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what ''I'm'' getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000. I don't know, but it sounds pretty ''sweet''. Let me see! Is this some kind of Jewish tradition? Thanks to Kyle's ''mother''. How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor. Gross, Kyle! YOU SICK BASTARD! Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah! Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it. 'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went. Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home! Talking poo is where I draw the line! Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you! Yeah, something feels...unfinished. 
Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan... They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend. Thaat's right. <i>'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...</i> That's right. That's ri-''aayy''.  Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember! I shoved it up my ass! Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance ''you'' had of coming to ''my birthday'' party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap! Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde... No, my birthday isn't until Saturday. Eeeeeeh! Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party? Psych! I wasn't gonna ''give'' you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder? Byah. Oof!  Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! Eheh.  <i>You got in trouble, you got in trouble.</i> Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday. Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see? ''Oooh''. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then. Now. As you can see, Kenny, ''you'' are to get me ''Yellow'' Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo! Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two. Eeyy! Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man! Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, ''you'' were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday! Cartman's birthday! You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel. Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?! Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.  Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!  Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents? Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef. Hey! What the hell do you think ''you're'' doing here? Yeah. Come on in and join the party.  Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  You son of a bitch!  You were supposed to get me the red Mega Man, eh! Now I can't make the Ultra Mega Mega Man, you dirty cheap-ass piece of crap!  I hate you! I want you to die! Die!! Aah! Aaaaaggghhhhh!! That's it! Party is over! Everybody go home! Get the hell out, I said! The party's over! Get out goddammt!! Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously. 
 That is so-ho lame! Oh man, I... Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.  Wow, she's pretty.  Yes, ma'am. Noh, he always pukes when he's in love. She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me! Until you puked on her. I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners  Memememememe, me! What's a multiplication table? We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen. Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!  Good-bye, Ms. Ellen. I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home. Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell. Nuh-uh! Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing! Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. Oh, hi, Chef. You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian. I am, too! My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet. This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian! I'm a bigger lesbian than you! Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. Dang! That's nice! Oh, weak, dude! Did you make love? No way! That's not what ''we'' just heard! What the hell...? Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box. 
Boooriing. No, ''I'' found it. No, ''I'' did, Pip. Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as ''you'' can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead. Okay, ready? I'll go first. Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! Eeyy! Give me that back! We'll ro-sham-bo for it! ANTHROPOLOGIST! I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!  Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! ...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan! Screw you, triangle thief! Eeyy! Oh I'll find it, don't worry! God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously. I was just ''setting it aside.'' Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do! Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it. Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him? What's that noise? Aaah! Aliens! No! I found it, he stole it! I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief. Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!  You scared the ''crap'' out of me, Ike! ''I'm trying to get my tri''- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back? Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddamn son of a bitch!! Huh?! Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with ''my'' triangle, now that it is ''mmyy'' triangle. Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers! Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as ''you'' can... It is? Yeeh, stealth bombers. Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen- Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! No, not when money is involved, stupid! Ugh. Let me go! Seriously! Eey! It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's! Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh. I don't remember. No! Don't! AAAAAA! AAAAADUH! WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand! Okay, okay.

I ''hate'' her! Sweet! No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now! Huh? Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah! Thanks for your help! Visit us again! No! That's ''my'' walkie-talkie, he gave it to ''me!'' Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll ro-sham-bo you for it! Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass! Oh no! She's back!

I want to know where I came from. Uh huuh. So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha? So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?  That isn't a very romantic story, Mom. Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American. No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!  Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people. Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut! Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation. My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it? Hiya, Dad! I'm your son, Eric.

I don't have $3000.  Hi guys. Oh, fine. How are you guys? Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing. Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000. Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh... Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.  You do? You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!

He's my father?! 
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life. Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!  Goddammit! Who's my father? You've got to be kidding me! Eeeehh..! Is he awake yet? They can't. Mephesto can't die. No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it. Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done. No! Don't! Eh-- Yeah, stop being a wuss! Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is. Wake up, you son of a bitch! I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do? What? <poem><i>...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...</i></poem> <poem><i>...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on...</i></poem> What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him? Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay? Sweet. Hey, who's screwing with the lights?  That is really starting to piss me off. Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me. What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is? Go, Kenny! Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop. Just tell us already!  Dammit! Tell me who my father is already! Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak. Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?! No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my ''mom?!'' Ooohhh, forget it! 
 Reading sucks ass. Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.  God, shut up, dude. I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.  Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle? Oooaaagh. I'm prepared! For my book report, I read ''The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe''. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison? Oh, good. In ''The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe'', a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus. God-dammit!  Goody two-shoes. Really? I wanna be a cop. Do I get a nightstick? 10-4, sergeant!  Ey! I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh? Step out of the car, please, sir.  Sir, step out of the car, please. Ey! I am a cop, and ''you will'' respect my authoritah! Get your ass to jail!  Sweet. Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you.  Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them. Well, hi there. Uh, wha-what are ''you'' doing tonight? Sir, step out of the car, please.  Sir, step out of the car.  Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.  Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time. Sir, could you step out of the car, please? And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?  Poor people tend to live in clusters. Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a... Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh. Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!  Chickenlover! Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!  Freeze! Put your hands in the air! I got reports that the suspect is ''in'' this area! A-ha! Well, ''he'' is not listening to my authoritah! Ooohhhh. Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys. 
M'kay? What the hell is a "bris"? Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris! Yeah, my ass is ''killing'' me. I wonder who took it. I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck. Wo-what's that? Ham? Screw you! It's ham, isn't it? Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman. That's the ''proper'' way to say it, or else you get a spanking. Dude! That is ''not'' cool! Choppin' off wee wees is ''not cool!'' Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman! What the hell is gahekgafuga? They ''are'' gonna cut off his fireman! No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents! What the hell is ''that'' supposed to be? Is that why it stinks so bad? No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house! Eech. Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't! Fireman! Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.  Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too.  Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway! Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow? No way, I set up mine first, hippie! Okay? 
 What? Don't you have dodgeball in France? Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.  Dude! He's going to the nurse's office. Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it? Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk? Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me... AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH! Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays. Heyh! They have a zoo there! Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy. I caught it, I caught it! Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap.  I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll! My mom says there's a lot of black people in China. So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? I dunno. Come on, rice picker!  Oooh, I get it. Holy crap! I love you guys. Ah, screw you guys! 
Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam? Son of a bitch. Was it fun? Man, Vietnam was sweet! Sweet. You're dead, Stan. Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week. Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick! Totally.  Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes! Lying kicks ass! Blululululululuh.

That's it! Now I'm all pissed off! Take that, hippie! Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack! Ey, you guys! Yeah. I didn't ''wanna'' do it, Jesus. They ''made'' me do that. Sent her away where? 
What?  Hmmm, let me see. No! Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.   I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try. All done! Ms. Crabtree? You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here ''forever''. I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes!  You guys suck! Was that how it happened? God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take? What?! I'm missing the new ''Fantasy Island.'' What do you think it is? Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison. Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford? Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Oh, yeah. Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza? I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again? Hay, wait a minute. Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle? Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.  Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense. It does? Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new ''Barnaby Jones.'' Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was? Now, that's what I call a sti- What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts! Deah, eh eh.  Oh man, what a weird dream! Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream. Yes, please. Mmmm.  Mmmm. 
Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!

Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture? Ugh... Whatever. Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come? It is not!  I am not swimming around in pee! My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday. I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation!

Selling T-shirts kicks ass! Whoa! Yes. And I've learned something, too. Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.

What is this? Halt! It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me! I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih-- --special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets. That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long! What? ''Herr Kommandant'' Cartman has ways of making you talk! What are you guys doing?  A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!  Wwwhy?? That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse! Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too! Fine! Fine! That's fine. Fine! No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman! Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker. No, Kenny. Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse! Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?  But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse! Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now. And stop your bitchin'! So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan? We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny. Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education. Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built. Oh, man! And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny. All right. You go find chicks, Kenny. Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'! Mom, can I watch ''American Gladiators''? What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon? Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?  Holy crap! Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!  How's the clubhouse coming, Stan? Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over. It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole. Ahaw, that's weak. That's killer. That's totally weak! Sweet. Killer weak, sweet! I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!" Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick! Who the hell are you?! How many people? Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare? This is bullcrap! This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
Wwow!  Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play? Five dollars?! Jesus Christ! That's easy! Ay! Check it out! Damn it! Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! I'd like to see you do better! I only have three dollars left, asshole! Sweet. I only need one, dude. I only need one. How much is it? Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five. Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over. I'm right! Eh! God-damnit!  I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me! Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money. Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet! I think we're almost to the end. How much? Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet. What? This is cool. It is, too! Aah, three dollars. Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math. Ey! Seriously! Well, I'm sorry!  Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him! Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends! Sweet. What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull? O-kay, I'll get on the bull. I guess, damn!

Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?  Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass! Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to ''you'' assholes! Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's ''hella'' poor! 'Cause I'm ''hella'' cool, that's why. You guys are just hella jealous. . Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?! It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squash-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!  Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here. Who'd you expect?

I can't believe what I'm seeing. Dude, this is hella weird. ...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and ''this'' son of a bitch is standing there! He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even ''look'' that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying. Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her. Dude, this is hella cool. Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry! Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass! Screw you!  Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!

 Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a big present, for no reason, except that I'm cool. Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.  Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?  Argh!  We don't care, Mom. Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap. How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me. Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to ''get a god-damned present?!'' ''Over the meadow and through the woods...''  Hi, Grandpa! Sweet. What is it? Yes! Move it!   I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech. Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?   Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home! I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!  Hi, cousin Elvin. Yup! Amen.  Bad Jimmy! Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Ow! What the hell was ''that'' for! Ow! Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap! Uncle Howard! Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?! Wow, cool! Okay. Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.  What?  All right, keeps your pants on.  Can somebody drive us to the mall?  Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?  Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall? Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!  Damn his Goddamned authorituh! I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin! All right. Give me $10.   My family sucks ass! Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns.  My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us. Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people.  How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff.  And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall! So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time? Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin.   I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap! Oh, uh that's pretty cool.  Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?! Lock the door!  See ya, Uncle Howard.  Piece of crap. 
Yeah, that's fine. How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, ''Everybody Loves Raymond''. Oh, so ''that's'' where all my underpants go. Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny? Heheh, you suck, Kenny.  You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.  No...more...coffee. Blech.   What will become of the endeavoring American family?" Neither did we.  Aw, man, this sucks! This guy sucks ass! ''[screen left to screen right] I believe in the family-owned enterprise.'' What now? Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?  I think my mom is a corporation.  Well, I'll be damned. Bad!  What?! Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him.  What?!  Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, ''you're'' a pussy! Ey!  Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome. Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house? Oh, your pussy village?  I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker. ''[exhales] No'' it ''is''n't, you guys! So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal? Oh, I get it. I love you guys.  
I ''told'' you guys.  There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. ''Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!''  Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey! Come 'ere, crocky. Well, he shouldn't have called me fat.  Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles!  I'm right here, Kyle. Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my ''face'', pussy!  Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles. Screw you, hippie! Come on, you guys, it's getting ''cold'' up here! Really?  Hey, there's a ''frozen'' guy down there. Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about "Greased Lightning."  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the- Aww, screw you guys anyway! For what? I think we're almost there, you guys. Yeah, like the kid with the wallet. Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this! Sweet. Killer. Fine. Damn, I'm pretty freakin' ''cool'' all of a sudden. Well, I don't see any crocs out here.  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch! You son of a bitch cat! Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face. He might have been, by crikey. Wow! Kick ass! Yeah, I think the same thing. Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches. ''I'm'' gonna go jam ''my'' thumb in some'in's butthole now. They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.  Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha. Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my-  And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its- Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here. 
Okay. What if you don't have any rhythm? Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm. Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. <i>[the other kids laugh]</i> Hey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch! <i>[drops down and pleads]</i> Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey. <i>[as he enters the bus]</i> Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls. Whoopee. Yeah, pretty much. <i>[hushed]</i> The nightmare begins. Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is! Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! <i>[Throws open his window and yells]</i> Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college! <i>[sits]</i> Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? <i>[Kenny looks at him angrily]</i> Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor. Whoa, dude, look over there! <i>[The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.]</i> Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys! Okay. <i>[pretends]</i> Cleek! <i>[grins]</i> <i>[rushing out]</i> Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here. <i>[covers his nose again]</i> I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass. I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks! Why? Eh-heheh! I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm! <i>[impatient]</i> Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We hear this a million times back up in the States. <i>[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey]</i> Bad! Bad monkey! <i>[it screams in pain]</i> <i>[stops]</i> I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head! <i>[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth]</i> It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth! <i>[throws the branch at the sloth]</i> Re’spect my authoritah! <i>[fed up, buries his face in his mitts]</i> Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!! He's a little wuss, what's it look like? <i>[Stan is hiding behind some foliage]</i> Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right! <i>[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him]</i> Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! <i>[hurries away, and the snake gives chase]</i> <i>[moves forward]</i> Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. <i>[the soldier listens]</i> We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. <i>[rubs his belly]</i> Y taco. Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.  This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore. I'm going this way!  Nononono! You ''nyah'', me ''nyah''!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home. <i>[walks away]</i> God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-   Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm ''starving'' to death! I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast! Food! I have to have food!     Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin? 
Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again? Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't- What the hell happened to him? I'm gonna be Jesus! Oh, and like you're gonna do it, ''Jew''?! Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home!  Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves.   Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't. This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home.  Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.  This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak. Peter! Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess. Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me. Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.   Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys. Up your ass with broken glass! Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!  Well, get me down from here! What?! Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  God!  Hey, there you guys are! You guys are in ''big'' trouble! Now get me down from here! You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down! ...Really?  Dude, superpowers are sweet.  You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here! Officer Barbrady!  Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here. You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down. Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.  Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now. You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this! Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stan and Kyle" song?! Ahem.  Chef! Chef! Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me! Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys! What? What?!  Oh, damnit! Hello-o.  Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now. Get me down from here! Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts. 
Mom, ''please'' can we just leave? But I ''hate'' the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat. That's what I ''told'' him, but he doesn't listen to ''reason''.   Hi, Doctor Lout.  Ey! Don't call me a little piggy! I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!  God damn it! Yes. I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! ''Mom!'' Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian! They look exactly the same. I don't know, two! Uh, one.  Two. Ow! I hate you!  Hey dudes. My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated. Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it! Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do. Hey, yeah!  Ow!  Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy. Can I have the yellow with a ''side'' of white? I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny.   Ow! My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean. Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a ''bitch'' she is. Bitch, I hate that bitch!  Stop calling me piggy! So, what does that mean?  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!  Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me. I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave! Ow! Son of a bitch! Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha! I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.  Uh, yeah, sure sure. Ey! Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses. Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef! Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind? Oh, no! Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow. But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus! Hey! You son of a bitch! Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days! Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus? Okay.  Aaah! It's the succubus!  What? What happened? You guys, it's six in the morning, I ''have'' to get some sleep. You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep.   What what what? I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard! Okay.  Ow!  Oh no! The tape jammed!   I can't see anything!  What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay? After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again! No, not with ''my'' eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Eh-sure. 
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom. I have to go number two. No way, dude! What would I wipe with? Well what do I sit on?  Urgh. Come on, now. Stop, you guys! I can't think! I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream...  Oh, that did it.  What the? Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!  You guys, get over here! I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes. Come on! Let's kill it!   Come on, you guys! Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.  No! No. Don't. I like it. Wow! Cool! Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door. Should I get it? Okay. Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature! You mean the other jakovasaur? ''You're'' a jakovasaur; that's what they call you. But the other jakovasaur talked different. I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it. He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left.  Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke! No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in.  Jakov, I want you to meet my friends. Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny? We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend. No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.  Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.  "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..." I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."  Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction. You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor! If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct. Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!  Aren't they cute, you guys?   Hey, Jakov, how's it going?  Moving? You... can't leave. You're my friend.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you. Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. ''I'' need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?  Yes. Who would take care of them?  I have authoriteh?  Fine. Hi, Jakov.  Who's laughing? Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready.  What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show. Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.  Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys? Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix!   Jakov!  Open this door!  No! Jakov, don't go!  Don't, mother! Just, don't. No. That's okay. I'll see you guys.  
Ooooohh. Oh, hello, excuse me, but ''Craig'' is the biggest troublemaker in ''our'' class. Told ya! I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class?  You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is.  Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass. ''Yeah'', I'll bet. Five bucks. Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater. Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it. I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.  No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today. You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked. Why don't we just raise our bet to ''ten'' dollars?! Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny! Those sons of bitches! Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek! Craig, you can watch ''Red Racer'' any day of the week!  Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig. Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed. Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?  After ''Red Racer'', of course.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge. Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something. Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch!  When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world. Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000. You're gonna be eating those words, asshole. Come on! What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other. You just hit each other, smack each other around.  I don't think ''that's'' very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna ''really'' kill Tweek.  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts! Fine!  Fine, that's fine! I'm ready!  Respect my authoritah!   Dude. Come on, now. Come on. I win! Hey, maybe.  The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right? Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong! Come on, Craig! Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass!  Come on, Craig! 'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it. Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad. Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig. Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar! 
When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind. I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool. What did you call me?  That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment! You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money. Oh, you did it again!

Is this one of your favorites? Oh, then you won't mind if I take it!  Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on. What? But uh, why should I sue the school? Interesting.  All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass! No way! This is ridiculous! Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no! Oh my God! You guys have to do something! Noooo!  What?! Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not? Where's that? I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors. You're-you're a worm. That's-that's cool, that's cool. 
 Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek! Are you okay, Salma Hayek? Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!   But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West. But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek. No, Kitty! I don't have anything! What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty! No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty!   Uh-huh.  Right. Aw, Ma.   Ow! You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV?  You're not allowed to have people over! This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!   Ey! I need to use the phone! Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah!    Ey, I was watching ''Aliens'' on TV! Who the hell are you? You know this guy? Christ, he's like 50 years old! Dude, that's not cool. Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit! Hey, what are you doing?  I'm gonna tell my mom on you. Ey! You ate all the pizza! That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass!  Give me that phone number!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over. God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip.  Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip.   Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now! Aaaaa!  Yes! I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home! You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can ''prove'' you had a boyfriend over heuh!  Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Oh! God dammit! Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!  You just want me to open the door! What?? Ih- is she okay? Huh?!  A''ha!'' I ''knew'' it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture! Haa''ha!'' I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it! O-kay! Let's see heuh. Ha''ha!'' Um... Aw, dammit!  Aw, man, you guys suck. You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!  Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head! Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh!  Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over! Well, there's a whole crappy band here!   Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?! I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here!  My Speak and Record bear. Of course.  Okay. See you in a while. Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly. Well, I just, I kind of like having you around. No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could ''pretend'' like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, ''we'' could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day. Yuh, you mean it? Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.  Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother ''is'' away at a party right now. That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve. I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh? I'm sorry. Did ''you'' say something, Skyler?  Agh! Gotcha!  Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway? You're not ugly. Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls? Weh-hull, I ''could'' ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know. If you want, I could help you. Just let me get my cowboy hat.  We don't have much time! Hurry up in there! That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face! Oh my God!  You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!  Uh oh. Yeah. I think we get along okay. Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat! Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush. That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West.  
Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is? That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! ''You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—'' ''—Christmastime is presents for me.'' Eeyyy  Well, ''I'm'' going to Spooky Laboratory!

Heh heh, I'm sweet. <poem><i>Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...</i></poem> We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!" It wasn't me!  Oh, come on, Kenny! You ''never'' have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest! A package? Oh, ''real''ly? Well, I think ''I'' can sign for that! ''I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present! [stops]'' ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  ''[walks up with the doll and jingles] Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.'' Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"  U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!  Uuh, problem, guys. Nno Grandma. Nno Grandma. Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff. How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?  Oh, no! This is ''my'' Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early! Wow, cool! That didn't help at all. Antonio, no!  
No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders! No, Kitty!   No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?  Yes. Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!  Mom! Mom!  Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store! Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!  Mom-Mom! I've only just heard.

Sweet. Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon.  Oh, god damnit!  Hey, dickhole. I guess you saw the commercial, too. Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the cutest.  C'mon. C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha-- C'mon. C'mon. Give me Pengin! C'mon! Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin. God damn it, you're supposed to trade, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!  You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon? Oh, please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday. Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle. It's all Chinpokomon now. You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?  Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master! Duhhh! Duhhh! Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.  Cool! This game rules! I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon... <poem><i>Come on, brothers and sisters<br />We've all got to join together<br />Join together and give me money<br />So I can buy more Chinpokomon!<br />We've got to stop this fight and...</i></poem> I haven't made any money yet. Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?! Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!  The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power. Oh, my God, that's so yesterday! Like, eight days ago. Get outta the way! Move it! Ohhh. Is this cool or not? I can't tell. Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana.  Minna-san! Kite kite, churi...  ...Gay. Gay. Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.

He's not dead yet! Me, too.  Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss!  
 A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!  Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.

Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled!   Eeehhh. Eehh, shut up.  Ooohhh, yeasss. Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door. Mom? Could you turn up the heat just a little?

Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys. Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.  That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that. No, Fonics Monkey!  You're damn straight, he did. Now you're gettin' it. 
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal! Oh, dude, this is not cool! No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard. Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!  Whoa, cool. Totally! Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin. Oh. We don't know him. Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one?   K-kill me. No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him. Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers. Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off. Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this?  Oh, my God, ''this'' guy again.  Oh! Aww!  Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house! Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off?  No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries. Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this?  Ey! I'm the leader of Earth! Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true!  No, never. It's perfect. Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait! Forget him! He's done for!  No, no, he's done for. Come on!  U-u-huh. I don't remember. Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one.  Holy shit! It's Sally Struthers! Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers! Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now.  Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you.  She bought it. Wait. I remember. It was the ''red'' button!  Alright, Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh. What? We're not gonna come visit him. T'heh, whatever.  
Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore! I'm playing the drum. You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  That's how you ''rock'', dude. I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks! Ey, I'll get it! Yes I will! Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damn it! What? No way! Flutes are totally gay! Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Later.  Good morning, gentlemen. Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time. Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did. Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win. Yes we are! Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month. Right. Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield.  Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!  Hooray for the South! But why? Why should they get the bell? But we don't ''have'' to lose.  God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!  So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?   Perhaps we should ''take'' Topeka. They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah. No. I say we take Topeka.  I'll bet you can't.  I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!  Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be ''my'' slaves for a month. Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.  Excuse meh.  Where did the Confederates go, son? Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.  Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.  Where are you going? We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!   No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?! God, I hate you guys! This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot!  Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.  Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take. Yes! Yes! Take the fort! Suck my ass! We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up. I knew they would! Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.! I don't. I made it up.  What the hell are you guys doing?! What?! No! We still have to fight! NOOO!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH! Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit! Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave. The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished! Hahahaha haa ha!

 Guess what? I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys!  Yes! I really did. Well, because yesterday I got my period.  My ''period'', you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month. Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!  You did? Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear. Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny? Tampon? What's a tampon? Ew, doesn't that hurt? Wow, cool! All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers. Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!   Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind? Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?! And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool. Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first. What's the matter, Kyle? ...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too. Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us.  Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet. Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew. Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go. Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she- Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has- Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!  Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there. Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas.  
That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long. Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh.  That was pretty cool.  No? How about this?  Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this?  We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control. That's a scientific term for crapping your pants. Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II! How about this one, Kenny?  That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.  Stan, what's a queef? Of ''course'' we know what a queef is, you queef! Aaaa-  Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it! I ''told'' you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise." "An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does ''that'' mean? How about geebo, or, or mung? Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.  You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys! The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?  I ''told'' you guys! That they should bring back ''Chicago Hope'' for another season? Totally. Ooooh. They ''should'' bring back another season of ''Chicago Hope'' though, seriously. Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this.  Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys. Uh-oh.  Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay? 
Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened! Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!  Yeah! This is so tits! Oh, I mean, this is so cool! Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard!  Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!  Aren't you stoked?!  For one tooth. Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits. Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under ''my'' pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast. All we need is teeth.  Sega Dreamcast?  Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits! I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because ''your'' family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny. How are we gonna get it from him? Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha. Higher, you guys.   I am the tooth fairy, my child. Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow.  Ey! Do not open your eyes until morning.  Square in the nuts. Bull's eye! I love that song, Mom. Sing it again. Okay. Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy. I know, huh? You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean- Four dollars.  Do you what this means? Tih-  What the hell? Mom! You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!  M- Mom? Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy? How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face? How can I trust you?  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.   There is no money. I know!  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.  My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money. But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Kyle, open your eyes, man! Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy. No, man, that's just a TV show. What? That your parents lied to you, too? How? Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat ''Oprah'' tits right there! Yeah.  Wow, look at the size of these houses! Hey,  Got it.  What the-?  Yeah! You ripped off our idea! It's better than ''your'' dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare! We were there first! Man, that is tits! Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see... Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent- Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang.  That's right. Keep the change, my man. Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit? Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family! Sure, Kyle. So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.  How much? Can I ask you a question, Weasel?  Do you think I'm an idiot? These are ''cat teeth'', you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  What?! I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you!  Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!  Will somebody take those books away from him? Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.  Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!  I got it! Kyle? Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face. ...Tits. 
Ey! Don't call me fat, Tolkien! Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?! We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding! Tolkien, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  There!   Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.  I'm sorry, Mom.  I'm sorry, Tolkien. Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  See ya later. No way! ...What the hell is a hate crime? What? A federal offense? Oh no?? Uh, yes? He's a black kid that goes to my school? He is black. I did? No! I hate hippies! I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!  Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole! No!  Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town! They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!  Calm down, Kenny! Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?! Well, come on! I don't have much time!  Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?! Huh-who's Romper Stomper? Uh... 'Cause I'm just like ''you'' guys. Uh-I'm one of you. Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like ''Animaniacs''?  So we're friends now? Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck. Hey you guys. Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think? A what? Wwhat's that? I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here  Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes? Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes! Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes. Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does. I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny! Well, okay... here... l'see... Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now.   Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass. Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.  Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here. Son of a bitch!  Here you go, God-damnit! Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here! But you said- I thought that- I want my Mo-omm  Mommy, I want my Mommy!  You will?  What's the matter? Uhokay.  Oh. Really? Yeah. I never really realized that until just now. Okay.  Oh. I can't take these.  Romper? You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me. You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!   That's right! I'm back!  What the hell's wrong with Clyde? I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house. Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside. When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's- Hey.  Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my ''friends'' for granted ever again. Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes? Sweet. Hey, Romper Stomper. Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too. You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?  Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh. Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-  
 Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me. Phew!  Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you- Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus! Yeah, me too.  Hoo-ray. That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me. That was awesuhome!  Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin? No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good. It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it.  Did you guys see that?  What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison? There you go.  Whah! I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins. So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  <poem><i>You'll be inside of me...</i></poem> Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me. Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh 
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!    Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain. Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers?  Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine! Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' ''on''!  Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for ''that'' kind of cash. Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better! What's going on? No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu! But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make ''bank''!  This is totally awesome. Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass! Hooray! Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down. Damn, we might be screwed.  Sheep-shearing contests!   Dude, what the hell happened? Huh? Take that!  Yeah, you suck, dude! Yeah! God, you guys are dicks! Yeah! Yeah, screw them! 
Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.  It's "Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up. Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says.  Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS!  I just gave you AIDS. Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting ''me'' to pay for it with ''my tax dollars''. ...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even re''late'' to you guys anymore because you're too immature! I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here . Nononono! Me h'myah  I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend! Hi, are you Tony?  Yeah!   Wow, cool! Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now. Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks.  Huh?  What the hell just happened? Okay, we'll try this again.  Lemme see, how about this one?  Mister Hammerhead? Mr. Garrison?? You wanna be my friend? That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first? Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This ''has'' to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I ''hate'' those guys!  Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?! No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?!  I'll ''tell'' you why! Because ''you'' guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me! Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?! YES I AM!!  Dr. Mephesto, I need help.  You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me. Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys! NAMBLA? Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!  Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool? Sure.  ...Sweet.  Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't! Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they ''all'' think that I'm sure mature they want ''me'' to be their new poster child is all.  Thanks, dude.  Really? Awesome! Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course. KIIICK ASS! Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a ''very'' important benefit in ''my honor''. We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for ''you'' guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Well, ''that's'' nice, 'cause you ''can't'' go. You ''can't'' go. No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only! Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.  Thank you. They're all over the place. Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out. Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  Now, are you a team player or not?! Well, Butters, there is no I in "team." Just go, Butters. We're running out of time. Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass. Well, what? Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There. No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long.  
 Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.  Oh, hoho. Ow. Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man! Huh? Not with me, man.  But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle. "Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny. Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5. No, mine. M'yah!  Yeah. Okay, mom. What's goin' on, guys? Oh-kay. Uh huh. Oh, I think I see where this is going.  Stan, why don't you just ask the question? <poem><i>'No no, no no, nono no!<br />Nonono, no no!</i></poem> Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price. I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle? Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars. What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah! No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!  Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp!   Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!  Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000! I do! I do care! Look how much.  Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!  Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney! It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay! Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before. You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please. No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE! Thank you.   Heh. Hey, what what's going on? Huh? Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!  I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!! Oh good, you got the crappy kidney. 
Thaaat's ri-ight. Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys! Yes, I do! Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home!   It's okay, I'm here.  Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever. The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.  Mmmm. You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again? Interesting. Aaand, what side are ''we'' on? Whoa! Calm down, ho.  I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone!  O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!  I'll kick ''you'' in the nuts! You won't let me help.  The Bog Monster speaketh.  Uh huh. Why don't we just talk about the swastika? I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it. Yeah. Cool. Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs." No way! Me neither.  Huh. Whoa.  Go ahead. Ahh!  Okay, It will be like this forever. Me, too!  Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh. Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha. 
<poem><i></i></poem> Yes! Yes! I'm a star! ''I'm a star!'' I'm--   God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million. Boy band. Boy band. There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God! That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over! Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it-- So? What?  Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!  Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.  We'll let you know, Butters. Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off! Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd ''better'' do it better than that.  Next! Kyle's brother? Christ's sake..!  Next!  Next audition!  '''''Goddammit, NEXT!'''''   No way! Okayokay, fine. ''Wow'' me. Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh.  Dude, she's a ''chick!'' "Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?!  Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up! Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse? We have to rehearse all that we can!  My mom made us costumes! Yeah.  'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.  ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not-- You can't ''be'' the tough one because you're Jewish! Since when?! Alright, fine! Here!  I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.  Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang" mean, then? ...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!  Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up! We're goin' to see the mall manager.  Oh, God, I can't see!    Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir! We... are Fingerbang! We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall. Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition? Alright! Let's do it, boys!  <poem><i>--you're my fantasy, you fanta--</i></poem>  Well, so can we play here? No?? Why not?! You don't think we're any good, do you?! Well, come on guys. We gave it our best.   Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems. I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  What's the Gomlich effect? So how do boy bands use that? Thanks! Okay.   Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay? I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera.  Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck.  Waitwaitwaitwait, ''cut!'' Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio! Fine! Who would you go crazy for? ...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer. Roll camera! '''''Jesus Christ!''''' Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and ''show him what we've got!'' Oh uh, Kyle has it.  Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine.   Hello again! I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.  Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool.  Son of a bitch!  You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease. Really? You will? That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock? Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed!  Aw, Mom! Where the hell is Stan?! I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will '''''have his nuts!''''' Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member. Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him. Oh, god-dammit! God dammit! People are walking away!  Just another minute.  Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard. Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name!   Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please? We will!  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...  No! He can't be dead! No! We were so close! But we have to perform! Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang! Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes! Ok-Okay, okay. Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us. I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd ''wanna'' become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!" Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  
 "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation." No no, no. Separation.  Ugh! Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom.  A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe? Yeah, what ''if'' we haven't? Jesus was made of crackers? So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.   Nno! But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right? Oh yeah, okay. Right, I already got that one. Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins. No, you're already going to hell. You are, too! Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault. What'd we do to Timmy? Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.  How was it? Huh? Who's in there? Well, here goes everything.   Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass... And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right? Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating. No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it.  Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!  Oho! Ohoho. I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.  Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh! Turn around so I can clean out your ass. What? Oh, now you've said it, too! Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again. Ugh. Oh, I know.  And he never took Communion! Yeah.  Come on, hurry up!   What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die! I'm first, I'm first!   You're doing unnatural things in the house of God! Oh, this guy is so gonna burn! Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves! We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed- There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew! It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And ''I'' am going to lead you there! 
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves! I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh!  Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  Who will help us? Praise God-uh! This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed. Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants.  No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress! This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!! Let us get back to our work at the church.  Hello?  Oh my God!! It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave! Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish. He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh! And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!  Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?! The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh! Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry. Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes ''out'' of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting.  Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon.  Sister, have you read this book? Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh. Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true? We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus!  Well... Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh? Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?! That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah! Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya? Praise the Lord-uh! ''For he is Lord, he is Lord...'' Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk! We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh! Devil be  '''''gone'''''-uh! Now ''walk'', Timmih!   Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh! The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-'''''walk''''', Timmih!  He walks-uh! Yes! Praise the Lord! ''For he is Lord<br />Lord, Lord, Lord''<br />Where are you from, little boy?  And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it? Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone!  ''For he is Lord<br />Lord, Lord, Lord''<br />Right here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?! He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!  Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say "Amen!" ''Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!'' And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!   It worked, you guys, it actually worked! Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all! Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route. It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school. Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that. My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!  Suck my balls! Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh!  Sister Anne is a blasphemer!  Uh-oh.  Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit! You're gonna send me to hell?  '''''Aw, crap!''''' 
Yeah,  There, that's better. U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her.   Why, that's PERfect!  Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.  Oh, I'm sure I do. I'm trying.  Fantastic, then. You guys are all such pussies! Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.  I wish I was still there. Yeah, we just ''have'' to find somebody who knows ''how'' to do it. Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how! Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously- We didn't ''do'' our homework, Ms. Makes-me-sick! We didn't ''feel'' like it! Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen?  We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa!  You're damn right they do! Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him? Who the hell cares?! God, these guys are such geek dumbasses! Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me. Yes! We've had a ''new'' time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  There it is! Come on, everybody!  No way, lady! You can suck my balls! ...What? Touché, teacher. Touché. What?? 
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase. He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag. Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume.  Yeah, that's me. Yeahhh, you already know about it? Well...  "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"  And so the ''other'' thing that makes ''my'' Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  and... Trapper Keeper? Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator. And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too. Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands. Oh really?  Hold it.  Hold it. I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once. Dude, you can't just ''ask'' to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be ''my'' friend, you'll have to pay me. Okay, that's cool. A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some--  Ugh..!  Ey! You son of a bitch!  Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!  There he is! Got ya!  Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?  Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.  You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener ''and'' a crayon sharpener? What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?! Aw, damnit!   Hey, dudes. Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I ''lost'' the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out. Why the hell not?! Wait... so then you guys burned my ''last'' one for no reason!  But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one. Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle ''got'' this guy to ''say'' that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of ''my'' Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home.  Ech! Screw you guys. Home.  Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away.<br />''[singing his own ''Dawson's Creek'' theme song] I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be over<br />The ways of my Trap--'' Oh, cool.  Whoa... Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!<br />''I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--'' ''Screw you guys, screw you guys<br />Screw you guys, scr--'' Huh?  Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--! ''I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.'' ''Hey, screw you.'' ''Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]'' Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home. Awww, man... Alright, alright.  Kyle... 
 Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines! No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene! God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk! ''How'' good? Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play! Yeah, but nobody told us ''how'' we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too. That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey! This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ''ever!'' Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in ''Les Misérables'' at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks. Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that? And ''where''... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me? You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!" Cool! Can you get it for us? No no!  I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!  OP-pression! Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks? Yeh. Whoa. Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy? Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey.  No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play! No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part. Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys!  Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!  Dude, we need your turkey for our play! I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy? I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it. Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh. Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything.  Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!  Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me. Like what? Hey, that's not a bad idea. Oh, man! No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes. Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!  Alright everybody, let's take our places! I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.  Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights. Union Mafia bastards!  Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller! ...Alright, fine! Get in costume! What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!  They loved it! They LOVED it! That's it? 
I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen? Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.  God, I have to do everything around here! ''I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.]'' What the hell's going on?  What?! You're God-damn right I have a problem! ''Terrance and Phillip'' is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?! Fat camp? Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am ''sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!''  Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how ''everyone'' in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies! Well, I'm ''pissed off'', Rick! How are you?  No.  Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!  This... is... bullcrap!  I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.  Take it! I can't eat this crap!  Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass. Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again! Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  Boy, am I glad to see you! You're ''damn right'' you can! Two Roller Pops, please! Hunh?   Memememeee!  Is anyone starting to suspect anything? Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over! What?! Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.  Suck my balls, 20! Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that ''your'' parents think that ''you're'' in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're ''both'' screwed!    Why are you crying, Chad?  Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend. Yes.  ...There you go.   Eh- shut up, you half-Chad! You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight!  What?! Well, screw you, fatasses!  
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies! Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care! Well, I guess you're screwed, then.   Well, you... could make them... go away for a while. Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away. Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you. I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months. You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  "my parents molestered me." No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  you say it was a bad touch. Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch." Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready. Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!  Notice anything?  Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that ''weren't'' arrested have moved away because they're ''scared'' of being arrested Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions. Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around. Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah! Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.   Ringy-ding? Aaahh!  Where is your husband? Seize her!   Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair! Butters, calm down, alright? I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it!  Heh, heheh. We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick! The Provider awakes! Aw, damnit! Alright.  Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too. Take him down.  Snow igloos kick ass.  
Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed.  Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay? Heh-tchoo! Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces! Family? My mom''s barely bought me any presents so far.'' Anything for more presents! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  Oh, Jesus, not this thing again. Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act. My mom could make a better Christmas special than this! Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!  Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat. What?! I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!  You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out? ...deh..OOOWW!!!  Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.  Don't call me fat, buttfucker. Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold! Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!  What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that. I guess- we might as well- go home now.  Yeah, ham. Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?! Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents. Yeah! I'll be a Jew too. 
 You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!! I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial. So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, ''Cop Drama''. No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television. You'll never guess. Guess. You ready?  "Shit." It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude. Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it. Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television! Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina? Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?! I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene. Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome! Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch? Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.  Huh? I don't get it. Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word! Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina. Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob.  You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob.   Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob. Kyle, do you ''still'' have sand in your vagina about us not going to ''The Lion King'' with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.  thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick. You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina. So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb.  Oh-Ho, gross! Kenny's got it. heh heh.  Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me! But... we ''can'' keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right? I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob ''is'' a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do! My house, too?  What a stupid voice.  Hah, I love you guys. 
That's not funny! Jesus Christ! Yeah, he's excited.  Hey, Butters. Hey, yeah! Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale. Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale. Don't call ''me'' an asshole, you som' bitch. Hehe, I don't sound like that. Cripple fight!  Awww!  Man, this guy sucks. Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again! But you ''have'' to come back. We ''hate'' our new scout leader.  Cripple fight! Cripple fight!   Eh, we kick ass. 
 Who's this asshole? Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream? Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks! When are we gonna learn magic tricks? Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club? Cool.  Heheh, guess who I am, you guys? Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.  Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you. Cool.  Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you? Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often. He's going to eat his own head. Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person. No you're not. No you're not. No you're not. No you're not. Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize. Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him.  What's he doin' here?  Now how the hell did he do that?   Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!   Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest? What? Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet. That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning. I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou. This is for your own good, Brother Kyle. Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit. At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble! Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die!   . Hey, I was just about to do it. Oh, that's so sweet you guys.   
 Oh, nothing. No big deal, really. Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all. Well, because, unlike ''you'' guys, I just got my first pubes! ''Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances]'' Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man! You wanna see 'em?  Here, check 'em out. There, see? How do you like ''them'' apples!  HA! My pubes. I got 'em from Scott Tenorman. Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks.    You'll get your pubes guys, someday. Uh oo what? Nuh uh!  But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars? You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.  Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please? Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you! Just give me back my money... Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!  Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you... You will? Oh, cool! Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents. ...Okay. Right. Cool. Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit! That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him! What? He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!!  One please.  O-kay, and how much is that in pubes? Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes. Racist!  Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!  What?  why do you want then back so much? I don't believe you. Pube fair? Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars! Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself! Haha, charade you are, Scott!   Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow! Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where the pube fair is? Yeah, I have some pubes to sell. No- no such thing? I'm Eric Cartman.  Aaah!!! A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here Alright, Scott, you win. I give up. Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...  Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down. Yeah. Poor grandma...  Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott!  What? Huh? Why??  Please Scott give me my money. I beg you to give me back my money. What?  I'm a little piggy.  Here's my snout. Oink oink oink. What- What are you doing??  No!... Wh-why? [yells at the sky] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!  Yes, Clyde!  Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge! Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!! What? Oh, right. Why should we care?   Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy! There we go.  Oh no, pony, he'll like that. No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off.  He said it was okay. Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!  Whattayou mean? How do I do that? I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!! Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead! You know, that band that sings that song: ''Well, I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo...'' So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  that involves them. Whoa! I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra. Radiohead. Yes, of course.   Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all? Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there! You're welcome, Scott.  Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?   I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys? Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?   Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's ''not cool''! Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.    That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!! Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out! How to get Scott Tenorman back! I just finished planning a brilliant  It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right? So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — ''and'' — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony!  Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  ...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!   Hello, Scott! I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!  Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride! Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.  A little penis-biting, perhaps? Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott? Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.   Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!  Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks! What's so funny? Not yet, but they will be. Hey, Chef. What contest? Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.   Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony! Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.  Goddamnit!  Alright.   Gawh, this is really good, Scott! What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?  Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."   Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet. Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  
Whoa, bummer, dude. Are you sure? I haven't seen it.  You guys! Hey you guys! You guys! Awesome! Give me mine!  Well yeah, dude. Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip! I think this new guy's funny.

Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies. We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to ''us''. Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie! Alright!  Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!

On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember... Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it. Huh, I think God has plenty of money. Not much, just taking my  Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make. HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take ''my'' hard-earned cash! Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch! My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure. What?! Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come. No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  ...And, so you see, this park is for ''me''. Nobody else will be allowed in it. Gentlemen, I thank you.  I'm so happy! I'm so happy...!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.  Aw, man, that was awesohome!

That's right! You stay out! ...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight! Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.  But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line. Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines. But I don't ''have'' any cash. I spent everything on this park. Ugh... Two people? Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park... Sweet.  I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in. The rest of you will just have to try another day. 'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. ...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  What are you doing? Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now?  Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security! Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it. But I don't know how it works. Ogh, alright, alright!

Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here!  AIDS? Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that. Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?! Just put it on, Butters. Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering? I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on! Do you feel protected? Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier.  I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up. So I don't get AIDS. I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face! Here, talk to them, Butters. Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence. Oh, bitch! Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now. Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now. 
Let a man take a crap!  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper. Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.  Why?  Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive. This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller. Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys! Hey, this is ''all'' of ours.

No it isn't. Egh! This is where you came from? Goddamnit! Can we ''please''... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?! Alright, I think we go over there.  You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time! I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid! Yeah, and you're a towel! We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we? Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level. Could you turn it up? Hup hup. Come on, hang on.  Kenny! Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there! Hooray! You're the worst character ever, Towelie. 
...Not really. Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors. Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those? God-damnit!  HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads! Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at ''war'' with these assholes! That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault. Yes, but they're sand monkeys!  God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!! Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off. Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it. It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom. Oh no, not Towelie.  No, we don't wanna get high!! That's right!  Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?  Aw, son of a bitch!  Uh ho, you guys. It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting. Uh, whatever! Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while! God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist! What is this? The freakin' Flintstones? It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to ''your'' crappy country.  What did you call us?! I told you! Jawas have no heart. You know, sand people.  God, I hate you so much, Stan! Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you! Dude, don't call me a Canadian!  Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-  Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive. I'm gonna go take care of this prick! He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people.  Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden? Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh Uh oh! Mmm-mm!  Hey look! An infidel!  So ''that's'' what this is all about?  Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ''ass'' of a chicken! Woohoo!  Haduqaduqaduqa.  There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create!  Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling. Come on! The cameras are ready!  Yeah.  
 You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny! Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look!  Yes it is!  ...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny. Uh oh.  Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back? Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long! Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!  YES! YES!   Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!  Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks! I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik. Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever! Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton?  Yes, I have it right hmya.  You will?  Oh, ah, thank you for your help. Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  And, and big rosy cheeks!      Come on. Come on.  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet! Look at, look at the description. Brown eye!  Oh, it's soo com''pletely'' funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!! No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.  No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be!  Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh God.  You guys, something's wrong. I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got? Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever? Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything. You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.  So does that mean I'll never laugh again? Ugh.  Oh, dude, oh. Nothing's wrong with me. Uh- Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here!  Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor. I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh. Okay, let me have it. Okay, why? ...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing. Who's there? Orange who?  ...naw, that didn't work either. Who's there? An interrupting cow who  What's goin' on? Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny. Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck!  A-heh, what? E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.  
What's that thing? What? Forty bucks? Alright, alright. Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?  Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.  ...Oh, man.   Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.  I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars! Ugh, ugh! Oh! Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration ''camp''. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people ''were sent'' to concentration camps. Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea. No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  Goddamnit, give me another chance! Haha,   He's faaahn.  1, 2, 3, 4...  He's faaahn. Heheheheheh.   I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.  ...Good job, Jew! 
 Stand by, please.  Oh, god dammit! Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature. Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS! I'll make you eat your parents! Nothing!  Aw, that is such bullcrap! No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Tolkien was able to do all that is because his family is rich! Oh, come on, Tolkien! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!  Ooooo, Armani Exchange! All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Tolkien?!  Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars. Hey, you changed your clothes, Tolkien. Not too expensive for Tolkien's rich ass family, apparently.   Oh, Jesus, dude.  What in the hell are they doing? Well, let's just play our game, then. Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny!  Kick his nutsack!  Uh huh. Yeah. Hey. Ey, you did me already!  
 Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it! Guess what I have sitting in my back yard? Better. Better. Better. Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes. Mint condition, tax free. Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle! Stem cells, numbnuts!  It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest. Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own! Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?  Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?  You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch. ...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!  Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.  eh, Butters? Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?  Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.  Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list. What is this, a PTA meeting?   In the ...hospital? Why?  Die? Kenny? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat.  We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter. Heh, sorry.   ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know. Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay!   ' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man. I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure. Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work? Not at all, but go on.  My God... So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue. Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat! Hmmm. Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind.  There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves. Oh, doctor.  Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind.  And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs. Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life. Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance. You guys! Come quick!  It's...  Look.  Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's! I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen. Aah! Kyle! ''[Kyle punches him across the face a few times] Kyle! ''[Kyle delivers a series of punches to the chest] 
Huho! We sure are. 
  Hello, is this City Wok?  Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.  Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny. That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is ''so'' cool. A- AIDS? Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now. Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.  It's a cash cow, I tell you. Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done. Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt? I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid! That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off. Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be! ''He used to be fat but not no more [Butters brightens up]'' ''[slowing] and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.'' Uuuh, school project. Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny! So how long until we can joke about it? Wugh, that's a long time to wait. Then eat your puke. Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it.  Get a hold of yourself, man! Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.  The ''fat'' one! Just like Jared. Sir, we are in business!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!  Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.  Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!  Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business. Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several. I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars. Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that ''I'' should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea. Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap! No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt! Check. That should blah  Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man! Alrighty. Alright, I think it's in.   There it goes.  Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.  Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good. Oh, whoa. Whoa!  Oh, crap! Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are! Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever. Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.  Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money. Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine!  Eh.  Well hello? Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it. Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad. Ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch. Bring it on, queer bait.   Hello? Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom. Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure. Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.   There you are, Butters! No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time! No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone! Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat. Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back.  Butters, it was my pleasure.  Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.}} 
 Look you guys, Butters is asleep. Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.  Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh. You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is ''so'' funny! So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler. You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone? Shh-shh, here he comes.  Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?! I don't smell anything. Do you guys?  Yeah, well, that's why they call it ''Ass''pen.   His name is Thumper? Ugh, no more.,  Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body.  
That's awesome, Kenny.  Aww, sick dude! Oh YES!!  Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  You wha- Really? Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow! Uh yes, I'm ''sure'' I can convince him to come on the show.  YES!  Hey, ''I'' know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crazy masks and special effects for their dumb movies. Yeah. Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. ''He'd'' put balls on ''his'' chin. He was such an awesome friend. Yeah. Nice. They look great on you, Butters. They really do. Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls.  Okay, here's your ticket  God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys? Buh-ters! Buh-ters! Testicles and scrotum!  Uh oh, we're losin' him. Oh, that was close. The present. Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"? Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole! Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world? What's the new topic? Oh. Hey, I'm out of control! Uh, sure! Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and potpourri, and queazies.  ...my, my mom? Mmoooomm? Could you do me a favor? Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt golf course in the wwoooorrlldd? I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you? Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother. Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother. Jeez, that girl is pissed off.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe? Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!  Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.  I'll do what I waunt! Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!  What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt! I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!  Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time!  Aaahh!  
They look so delicious.   Memememee! Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious. Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too? Alriiight!  No, Uncle Jesse, no!  What? What the hell are you guys doing?? Where are we going? What? Why? So? Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass", "butthole", and "douchebag". I really don't feel like you guys's friend.   Oho! So you ''need'' me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering Playset! Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass.  Just give it a little kiss and I'll help. Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it. Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it. No, it has to be Kyle.   Oh man, that was soho awesome! Hell, I'm not goin' with you!  Heeeey!    You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset. Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off. O! At least I ''have'' an ass, Jew! See? Maybe they ''want'' to become sweet juicy veal steaks. I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood. Eh!  Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling.  Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer. I want out. Yeah! Wait-what?  Oh, God-damnit you guys. We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?! Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again. Can't go on. Need... food... There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf. All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters.  Food! Look you guys! Beef jerky! Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy. Go ahead, that's more for us.  Who's the hungry man? Hippies! What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!  Talk to me Mike. Sure, sure. What do you have in mind? Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike. All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -  We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye. Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.  Hello. All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf.  Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?!  We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here!  Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else!  Mike, speak. We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us? Good, good. Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike. And Worf? Step back! Tell those men to step back!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, and you must refer to me as "Captain." No. See, you must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?" You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.  "Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"  Okay, all set! Step on it, Mr. Worf!  Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!  "Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?" Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.  Oh, it's a double-cross!! What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf! Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are! Thank God we stopped it in time. 
All right! Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are? I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd! Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name?  Stan, okay. What's your name?  Kyle. What's your name?  Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break. Amen. What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated.   Dude, do you wanna see the Terrance & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that?  Okay, how about ... that?   It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole! I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.  Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!  Huh. Ohmigod! Huh. God, when is this gonna get to the commercials?  Argh! We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.  Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih! There, you got it, you got it! Oh, thank God. We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials. This TV is great, Chef. Aagh! God-dammit!  This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that. Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me! Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it!  Here we go! That's it? That's all the commercials? Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now! Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people! Eewww! God, I '''hate''' old people! And '''my''' house is being fumigated!  Leave no doughnut behind!  Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding! The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on!  These commercials are all so God-damn stupid! You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.   Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too. You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to see. Yeah, it sure does! 
I'll do it. Butters, could you take a seat, please? Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation. Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap," so to speak.  Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out. I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo... Lame, yes. Yes, well, we weren't.  Who cares?  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions? Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.  ...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop.  We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...  All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay? Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to? All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out!  Next? Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody. Alrighty then.  Uh, what's the question again? Five times one is of course... Five.  Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!  All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle? Just one more rose, Kyle. All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out!  Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!  Next please. If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained? Very nice.  You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap! All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next!  Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron? I think Towelie is awesome. Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered. Tolkien's a smartass. Yeah. Do we really need another one?  Oh, thanks Jimmy. Alright Jimmy, see ya.  Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend.  Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to?  
 Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all! No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room! Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff. Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow! If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person! Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss... Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?  What the fuck is this?!  I got RIPPED OFF!   They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep.  Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!  Heheh, okay, okay. Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!  Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up! Tweek! Where are you going? In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one. We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves. Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.  Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word! Is it her? Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Hemmm... No, just a bunch of goo. There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.   It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium! Well if they found somebody else's sea ''men'' in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too. G'night, guys.   You won't believe it! Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK!  I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety. That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can ''really'' see them thrive. Tweek! You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in. Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men. Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men? Do you have them or not? What's your name? Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound?   Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five. No, gallons. Dammit! Give me all you've got, then!   That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek? And I've got the sea men.  Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley. Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  Nothin' to do now but wait. Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah. Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!  Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god. Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea. I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever. What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?  ...So? Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares? Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room. That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people!  Yeah! Go!  Oh God-damnit!  Oh no! Oh the humanity! Why can't societies just live in peace?}} 
I don't know. Ih... in our... butt?  Maybe... No. Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing? Hm. Aw, dude, I think I might have it.  It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right? Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm? What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius. Have you ever tried it? I bet you twenty bucks it'll work! Okay, let's go, Jew!   God, let a man crap! I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!  I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around. Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!   You owe me twenty bucks, dickface! Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice.  It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!   I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills. So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!  Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm. Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.  That's stupid and immature, Cartman!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters! So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  O-hoo, what's that, Kyle? Heh...  what?  
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.  Yeah, we want our money back! You asshole!  Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit. Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we ''thought'' you were a team player! Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU! Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up! Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here.  Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up. Well we can just make them out of paper. It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!  TWEEK!! How many hats have you made? We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out! They're gonna kick your ass, Tweek!  I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.  Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them. But just remember that I do all the talking. Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it. Just now -  What could possibly go wrong?   Yeah, we're children. Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted. Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence? Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative. He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?  Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well. People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?  Alriiight! Get it, Tweek! Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it! Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.  Hit it, Tweek! ''[Tweek goes over to a boombox and presses the play button, then returns to the group. Caribbean music plays] In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, there's a lots of-'' ...No, he has an icy heart. It's a ''cool'' island song. Oh, do we wanna do that? Wow. AY! Man, that new version must have sucked balls. That and youth. Those guys are old. 
 Now it takes the lotion from the basket. It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket. It puts the lotion back in the basket!  Put the lotion in the fucking basket! Yes, mom?  No, our teacher's dead. Remember?  Two weeks ''isn't'' enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.  But I wanna plaaayyy! Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home? Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears? It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt. Yeah, may be. Right, heh. Woohoo. God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone. Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert!  Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk.  Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met. And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process. And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend. Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you. And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you and some peanuts.  And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip. Pleeeeease???  Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?   See, and this is Precious.  Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again." Heheh, yeah. Now say it again, louder. Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket! Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!" Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious! Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!" You bitch, I'll cut your throat if-  We're playing "Lambs." Bebe's boobs? So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was? What a stupid bitch! }} 
 One please. Dude, relax. Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him? So weak. So weak, dude. Man. At least I'm not a stupid Jew. Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah. 
You bet your fat clown ass it is!  ...ticket stub? Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?  GODDAMMIT!!! You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember.   Kenny!!! Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!  What the ''fuck'' is closure?! You turned him into a teapot? Wewewewewewe... Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe... ...Kenny?  Kenny?! What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?! God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix! Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?! Hmmm.    Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning! How? I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car.  ...No.  Ey! Euuugh.  Wha-uh, what?? What? I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off. Do you think? Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.  Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet! Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough. Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them. You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O. Because Jews don't believe in heaven! Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it. AH!  ''In the ghetto, <sup>in the ghetto</sup>. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, <sup>in the ghetto</sup>'' What did you say?! What did you say?!  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina? I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.  You're a- stupid Jew.  Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.  Shut up!  Shut ''up!'' That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me. I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body. Looks like I've come to the right place. Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that I need sucked out, please. Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium!  Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out! Eh!  The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  You guys! YOU GUYS!! You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket!  I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere. I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW!  Not by giving me brain damage!  AY!... ...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.  ...Oh Jesus Christ. Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God!  
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now! It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way. Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire.  And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew. Jews can't be Paladins. Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense? Man, that's crap. And so the party returns home after completing their great quest. Prepare for battle!  This sounds like a really important quest. This... is so cool. Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house.  And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house. Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen.  ''You're'' gay! Yeah! The one tape must be returned!  I must say I agree. If this copy of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.  Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.  We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape. Thank you, High Elf of Paragon. Clyde's a dick. Kevin, god-damnit..!  Talangar the Black returns from watching the video.  My God, this thing must really be powerful.  Quiet! You're acting like a bunch of assholes! Yeah, stupid.  Shut up, Kenny. A dark wizard must be trying to stop us! Yes, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--  It's Butters. Yes. He's been following us for like two hours.  Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away. There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up!  Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water! I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water! Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter! We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what "lost" means, stupid! '''''Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!''''' If that was possible. We're screwed. The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well. And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated. 
 Pakistani.  No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?  No, it was Kenny! Ey! Aw man, this is awesome!   I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!  Look, a covetous Jew! Ey!  I'm not fat, I have a different life choice. Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass!  I'll take three lunches today, please. It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC.  Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work. Nothing.   
 Kenny. Shut up, Kenny. Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!  Hey you guys! How's it goin'?  What the hell are you assholes doing here?! Oh, about a month. He's gone again.  That was Kenny laughing, not me. Kenny! Thanks, asshole. Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass! Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ! Oh, good.  Oh for the love of Christ.  No, Kenny, it's not funny! Right now? Whoa, whoa, watch it lady. Ahh, Aahhhh!   Hey, ah I feel a lot better. God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland! It's still at baggage claim! 
 Who's this asshole? Then how does he know our names? Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes ''this'' douchebag? That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!   Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was ''you'' guys. I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock? Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer? That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since. Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you.   God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh? Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is in''flicts'' those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way. Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about five bucks? Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop. Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches.  Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents. Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house. Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom. Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice. Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school. The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office. Your parents will drive all the way out to the school discovering that no meeting is actually taking place. And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop.  What? Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches. Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog. Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?  Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it? I am a professional, suh!  Don't worry, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied. Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop! ¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba! Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado. Marrado. Spectacularrr. God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far? Yearh, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice. Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! ¡No come la taco la trabajar! Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off. Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ¡Vamonos! Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby. Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I ''should'' think about who I'm going to become. Who the hell are you?  Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful! Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want! 
You're done? Yeah, so how's it look? But I'll still be getting presents this year, right? What?! Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one?  It was nice for Tolkien; he laughed for like 20 minutes.  God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch! Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!  Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night! Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it? Jesus Christ!  I'm just letting you guys know how special you are to me. Oh my God, that's it! Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunates! Follow me!   Oh, this'll be the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too. They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to ''give'' it to them.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you! The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else. Really? Wow!  Get the rest of the stuff you guys! You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunates!  Now come on! ''Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!'' Wow, is that where Santa lives? Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?   Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well. That's what I thought. Hooray! No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He ''can't''. Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!  Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll! It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool. Oh, Christ. Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas! Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet- Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh! ''I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-''  I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.  Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate! ''[resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...'' Jesus! This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people. This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys. ''Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-'' Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means. Oh, God-damnit! Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again!  
What? Yeah! Go home, you little dildo! Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!  That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long. Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  And they had big heads and big black eyes… What? No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so. What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about? Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me. No I don't remember that! No, because the aliens erased my memory! Aw dude, I hate repeats!  What?  Haha, very funny. Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing? Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Ooh. Oww... Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooh-ah. Uuuuu, aaaaah.   Aaaaaa, aaaaaah! Ooagh! You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!  Nope! It has to be Kyle!     Gahaaa! Derrr! Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych! All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle. No, go ahead. I'm dry. But it was one of the best times I've ever had. Okay.  This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven. Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.  It's ''that'' guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities! What are you doing, man?!  When do we get to eat. I'm hungry. Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me, you guys!  ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you, Lord. This is like my fifth time.  Aw God, that movie pissed me off. Santa!  Oooo, very nice. How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys? Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth!   Tell us about it. No. There's even World War Three to look forward to.  Uuugh. That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long. What is it, Chef? 
We didn't go to your comedy show. Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it! Can too! Oh God-damnit!! But they say I can't be in their club!! 
 Put more clay on the balls.  You can't do that! You're an ''art'' teacher! We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic. Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house. Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.   Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank! Should be fine. Okay.  Yep. All set. Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game. Heh yeah, that that's right. No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night. It's the right address-wait! Look there!  So? Kyle, you're being an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Come on, let's go!  Aw man, that was sooo awesome!  Who cares?? Me??  Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her. Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime.   Damn! Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine. Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46. Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??  Oh, for Christ's sake! Thank you, Stan.  "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now? Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй. They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal. Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!  Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere? No need. I have one for you right here.  Is there anything else I can get for you? You do that. Goodnight, Kyle.  Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle. Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack. Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.  Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is! We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle. Why not? He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us.  I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride? I just thought we should find a private place to... talk. Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  So how are things, Kyle? And you feel like you have to confess. I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while.  Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness.  Won't be long, Kyle.  I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours. They did? But can I still kill Kyyyle? Uh, can we see them-him-her? What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball? You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now? What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime. Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever. So... so then, how can you feel bad? ...But he's not gonna get in trouble. What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later? Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man! Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry! It's over this way! Come on! So how are things, guys? I'm afraid I can't let that happen. Can't I?   Hi guys. I told them everything, you guys. It's over. My consciences just caught up with me. I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later. I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible. Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you- Hm. 
 Math homework, Math homework. Where did I file that?  Bush is a Naizi ...Eh the... Foggy who?   But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off. Maaaa. M-maaaa. Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  In those days? In those days? In those days? I'm trying to have a flashback. You know. If I have a flashback, then I can ''see'' what 1776 was like first-hand! No. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.  Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa! That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776.  All I have to do is be ''thinking'' about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers! Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Benjamin Franklin?  Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew! Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time. Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers! I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history! Or a really sweet one.  Whoa, here it goes!  Ohhh awesome!!!  Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is? Oho yes! I did it I did it! Oho kick fucking ass, dude!  No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback. Super neato!  But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report. And I am the official messenger boy, I am.  Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day. It's a bitch, ain't it? Wow.  Whoa, how very very relevant. Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time. Wow!  If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say. I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.   You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too." The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass. 
 Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.  Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts? Oh, you mean this one?   There we go, Saright? That's a very pretty dress.  Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez. Nono, Jeh- Jeh- Jeh- Jennifer Lopez. Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts? And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you.  Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass! Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.  Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez. Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle? Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss? Is nice? Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court. Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too. I agree. Those places are stupid. Hey, I'm on your guys' side. Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five! All right all right, here's ten dollars!  Yeah, I wanna leave. What? Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez.  What do they want? S'awright? What? What?  Hello, are you still there? You want to sign Ms. Lopez? Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich! Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs!  There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!  Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  "Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!"  Awesommme. Yeeessss.   Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha! Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week.  And famous. Jennifer Lopez? Not me! I'm sure it was just a mistake. Shut your God-damned mouth! Nobody! Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop! I will! Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now. Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez. What the hell are you doing? Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep! Sleep!  Sleep! Moooommm!  Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!  He-yesss.  She's not here right now. NO! I'm not going out in his car. I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.  I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!  NO! Aw, God dammit!  Aww- awww, dude! OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!! Aww crap. OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW! I told you this would happen.  Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck. EHAGH!  Ben Affleck is naked in my bed! You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again! What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!! What news? S'aright. Oh, balls!  Guys, I need to talk to you. I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez. Stop doing what? Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See?  Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez. Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does. Quiet, Ms. Lopez. Guys... Uh... Uh...  I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?  I got you kinda! I got you kinda! 
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar. Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve? My God... What have you got, Marsh?  Jesus, we're too late. Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her! Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death.  The torso he would dump into the lake.  And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie. Looks like the game is over, old man!  Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington.  And get us some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass! Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll. No sign of forced entry. We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over! Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat. Right. I think I know exactly where to start.  Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?! Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth!  You're going down, Butters! You hear me?! You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying! Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample.  You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup! Stop playing games! That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body. I don't know. I was hoping you guys did. Really? Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?! Follow me to the bathroom.  Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup. Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well, Butters?! Well pull harder! Try doin' it faster. Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?! The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes! Let's go!   Kyle!  I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew! Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them.  Why not? Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got! Yeah! This was our hot lead! Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off! All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh! We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process. Kewl! Uh bonus? Me neither.  Hey! Broflovski's a good cop! Awwwwrrr-auugh.  We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.   Butters? Are you still trying to give a semen sample? Well, keep tryin', Butters.  A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods? Uh oh... Bang bang bang...    On your American Express. You did? Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five? 
Man, Indians have it good, huh?  I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?! Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude.  Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians! That's right!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS? Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now. Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts! You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies!  
What? Tell us? Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ''ever!''  What a dork! Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall!  Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th.  We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys. That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.  Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you! Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies ''mega'' gay! GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  You're straight like a freeway! You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!! ...So? I'm half bisexual! I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi. Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp. Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that- Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle. We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle. Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy. He's not our friend.  Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.  That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade. Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude!  
God dammit!   Heheheheheh heheheheheh.  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?   Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!  It worked for Creed!  You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius! Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before ''you'' guys do! Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go!  Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle!  Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters!  No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!   Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me.  I told you, Tolkien. Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives. We are going to start... a Christian rock band. Wait!  Still want to leave, Tolkien?  Thank you. All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Tolkien, give me a smooth bass line.  Tolkien, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass. Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line!  Almost there, you guys. Because, Tolkien, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.  I'm going to kill you one day, Tolkien. Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too.  No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care!  No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool! Tolkien, look away to the right.  More! So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover.  Oh hey guys. How's it going?  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum. That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha! It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album. I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta!  Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..  I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ. Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.  Who are you? Yeah, you guys are real hardcore. Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.  Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent. Yes, we sure do.  Well what are you saying? That, that ''you'' don't really love Christ?? Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this?? I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now. ''Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.'' ''Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.'' Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly. Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense. We're Faith Plus One, Tolkien, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!  Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now.  Ahhh, this is the best day of my life.   Thank you very uh- wah? ''Myrrh'' album? You mean to tell me I can never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?! GOD DAMMIT!!  Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums! OH, FUCK JESUS!!   Ah, fuck you, Tolkien! You black asshole! 
 Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring. Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly. , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey! I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body. Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.  Calm down! We cannot understand you!  Old people! Oh God, they're coming!  They're not gonna stop until we're all dead! Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong? My God, he's right.  Except for you, Kyle. I believe that's us... thank God.  More old people! Old people gone mad! So our only solution is to cut off their life force. No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here. Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do. Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week. I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight. We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people. [''they appear from the sides of buildings dressed in black and then gather in front of one of them''] At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. Yeah! Aw yeah! Well, right, or we could always do that. 
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome. Who's joking?  You have AIDS?  Wow! Casa Bonita?! Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff! This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita!'' You... your Mom said you could take three friends. Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny? Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?! I have never been a dick to you. Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?  Okay, except maybe for that ''one'' time. Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place   Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.  Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!   Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!  What isn't it? ...I don't understand the difference. Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something. Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people? Okay, so how do you act ''genuinely'' nice to people? Like what? Who's there? Take that, Jimmy!  Oh, Kyle. Hey. Uh...  Knock knock, Kyle! Hey Kyle. Well what? I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go. So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool. I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later.  I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore. Good. Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!  Butters, can you keep a secret? For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible. A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth. Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...''pray'' that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything? Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust. Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer?  Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth. I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus. According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours. No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter! Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry!  Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here!   All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks. No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth. Well, you know, with your wiener.   Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present. Hope you have a good one. See you later.  Yes?  Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything? Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.  Casa Bonita, here we come! ''Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!''  Well, let's get going, shall we?  Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would ''want'' us to go. You know Butters... Next Saturday?? I'll ''never'' be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.  Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!  Butters! Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!  The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time... There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.  No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh... We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can.  Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.  What what what? UUuuugh!!   Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way! The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals! They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive. We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins. Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location.  Good. Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town. All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice.  Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble. We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter. Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God! It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!   We've got to fight them off!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!  Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!   which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well. We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you! Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you! Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter. I love you too, man. I just  Hah!  Oh, that would be so bad-ass! ''We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon.'' You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.  "Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show. What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle. ''Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]'' We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great! But... Casa Bonita.  Stand back!   Less than a minute! Less than a minute! Oh, awesome!!   Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!   Yeeeesss! Totally.  
 Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag. Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place! Go kick his ass, Stan. Will he bleed? That's all we care about. Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in? They're just standing there, talking.  You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole! Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?  Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love. Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.  Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together? Oh my God...  Eeheehee, Jesus Christ.   Oh no! You guys broke up? Uh oh, the jilted lover returns. Damn, that kid is cool, huh? 
I'm going to kill myself.  You guys, Kenny's eating his own hand.  Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey.   Nothing. Nothin' Na- Due-nothing.  Gross dude!  No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes. We're sorry. Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah! Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us. Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you? Got it!   Isn't he awesome, you guys? Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol.  Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.  Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today. Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome. Oh my God, that is what ''I've'' always said.  I love this guy!  Wow, a commercial? God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps? So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!  Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle? Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.   Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house. Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!  Heh, okay, okay.  Dead?? Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part? Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.  I'm not eating the cupcake.  Jesus Christ! HAAAA! They're going to kill me!  The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!  You guys have to help me!  Please, you guys, I don't know what to do! If I go, you guys go! Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us!  Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong!  You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company!  Aw awww! 
Right. What are we playing again? Got it.  What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank! Yeh-heah, right! What a whore!   God, what a fag! How do ''you'' know? We haven't even tried the food yet. Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.  
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas. We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas! Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time. I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all. Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you.  HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas! What? No! No, this can't be happening!  You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!! Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to ''your'' family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!  This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now. You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents? Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all. We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-''eight'' hours to still give our patents twenty-''four'' hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.  Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing! You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort. Of course I care about Christmas- oh, Christ on a stick!  Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here! Weak. Look out! Oh Jesus Christ. Which road?!  But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister. Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time! How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away.  How could you be so stupid! Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.  And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents.   I'm gonna kill you, Kyle. It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada. Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom! 
Pfaha, so funny.  Yeah. We won't have to take crap from ''anybody''. Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?! I'm gonna get those killer sai.  for a dollar ninety nine. Parents? Parents?!  Why?!  Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!  Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies. Kick ass!  Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous. Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine! Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, ''The Passion'', and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true. Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig.   Look what we got.  Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy. Ugh. Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas! Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome! We're playing Ninjas, Butters. No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us. Yes, and no time to do it. No time...  Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it. I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers. I have the power to have all the powers I want.  C'mon! Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys. That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass! All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain! All right! And now I will use my power to...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya! Oh, shit, dude! Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard. Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character. Shut up, Butters.  Dr. Shafley? So if we make Butters up to look like a dog... Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here.  Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole! Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters. Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot. In here!  No way, you got weapons too?! Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!  We're twice the ninjas ''you'' fags are! Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa! Butters! Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here ''right now''! We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code! Here, Butters! Butter- Butters! Here, Butters!  Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things! Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try. Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true.  All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by. I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  Here, hold this stuff for me. What? I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction.  Hey, fuck you, Kyle! 
 The ''Special'' Olympics? What's so special about them?  What? Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement. What? What'd I do?  You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich! Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"  So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just ''pretended'' to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks! It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps! Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see.  Why? What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is. Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye! Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr. You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now. What?!  Moooommmm? Um, could I get you to do something for me? Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars?  I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special. ...I'll split the money with you.   Help me change? Awesome.  Naaaa! Daaaaa! Naaaa! Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa! ...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa! Enter.  Go on, Kyle. Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew. Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul. Yes.  One thousand dollars, yeah!  Daaaa! Daaaa! Whoa. What the hell??  Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.  God-damnit! All right, this one I can win!  God-damnit! Ah, screw you hippies! ...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!  Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  
 Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine. What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew? All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew? All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.  It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle! Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible. Set phasers on stun. Yes. A little too quiet. Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle! Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for! Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along! Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, ''The Passion'', and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil! How do you know?! I've seen ''The Passion'' thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it. Go see the movie, Kyle! You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.  Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of ''The Passion'' then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson. Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Mom! Doorbell!  Mom! Answer the door! God damn it, lazy-ass whore.  It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?  Mmm, one more time, Kyle. I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen. Mel Gibson's ''The Passion'' Fan Club. Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m. What? You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes. If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick. Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall! Bitch?! Don't call ''me'' bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open! I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch! Eup.  Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved ''The Passion'' as much as I did.  Tell them I'll be down shortly  Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by ''The Passion'' like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done. But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.   all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see ''The Passion''. Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean. One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie! And as we march for ''The Passion'' we should also ''voice'' our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung," you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."  Es ist Zeit fër Rache!  Es ist Zeit für Rache! Es ist Zeit für Rache! Nice.  Es ist Zeit für Rache! Es ist Zeit für Rache!  Juden! Mel! Gibson!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?! Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution! 
Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass.  Ha! You just got f'd in the a! Yeah! All right! All right, Butters! 
 Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000. I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot. Yes. I will be your new best friend. Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.  Really? Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.  That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets. Oh, really? Heh. Wow, that sucks. Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart. Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you. What? You saw that? Nuh uh. No way.  ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters? Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape? Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.  Oh, son of a bitch! AWESOM-O does not have a mom.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears? I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video? What? Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function. ...No way. Weak!  Lame! AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading. Where is it? Where is it?! Wah! Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you. AWESOM-O understands. Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape! I would like some Sunny Delight too.   I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer. Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay? Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?  Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Weak. Yes, of course.  Suck my balls, Kyle.  Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere. What? Lame. AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please? Thank you.  Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming.  Argh!  Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps? The New Orleans Saints.  Seventeen.  Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something. Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something. You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.  Haaaa! Haaaa! AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint. Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut. ...What? AWESOM-O does not understand.  Lame! Not cool! Totally lame!  Waaaaa! Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa! Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?! The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?! I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive! I said I'm a real person, asswipe! Goddamnit, get me down from here!   I'm not a robot, I'm a human! Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!  Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real! Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am!  I am the AWESOM-O 4000. Uh... now ending fart sequence. Smell sequence initiated. Lame... 
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs.  No. Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels.  Oh my God, this is awesome!   Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world! Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!  They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train. Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come! Choo-choo train! Yay! ''Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.'' Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you. ''...Train together'' ''I've got time. Do youuu??'' ''Choo-choo train.'' Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight! You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want! Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?! You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away! He is ''my'' friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I- Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson! Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend! Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said ''we'' were best friends.  Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls!  Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember? Mr. Jefferson, hello?!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery! Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child? 
 Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars? Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am! It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  What? Dude, I'm takin' a break. Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers. It works, doesn't it? Did I ''not'' just get us an extra five bucks? Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass! Shoveling accident. You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it. What?! Who?! We can't understand you, asshole!  Look, it's working!  Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other. 
Butters, shut the hell up!  Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot. Ye-heah! Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich." Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be ''so'' funny! It is not! Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week. Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a ''super funny'' turd sandwich? It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it. A turd sandwich. Turd sandwich. Turd sandwich. Awwwww! Okay. You win, Kyle. All right turd sandwich! Giant Douche sucks! Game on, Jew-boy! Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow! We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot. Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy? Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school? You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd ''and'' the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives. So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes? Well then, perhaps we could interest you in   Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings. Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move. Oh, no! Noooo!! 
You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants. Yeah, when you die, your ''jowels'' release and crap comes flying out your ass.  Oh yeah?! I'll bet you ''five bucks'' that when you die you crap your pants, asshole! Whoa, awesome!  Dude, check it out! ''Time Cop'' on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks! Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks! Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight! Dude, you can't shop for crap.  Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper? What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle. What? That's called progress, Kyle. ... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks.   Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle! You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you? No, but ''you'' got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it. Oh, awesome!    Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out. Nuh-uh. I am not, Kyle!  Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart. You heard what? That's not what I said!   Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!  I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do! Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much? You speak too much, sir!  That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!  I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along! No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. ...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-  Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off. 
Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on? Really? That's cool. When did-  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at ''us'', Trent Boyett?! Oh, Holy Jesus, God... It's true. He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men. Jews can't ''be'' firemen. Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew! But how do we start a fire? Don't worry, Trent. Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing! Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did. Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. Whatever. That's like five years from now. Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents! You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart! We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters! Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!   Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool. I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts. Nononono, you gotta go  "But Mo-o-o-om."  "But ''Mo-o-o-om''." Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks. Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now. Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff! All right! You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world! Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass. Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.  A picture of your mom's boobs? A lot of stupid things that we regret. Aaaaaaaah! Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth.  Stay away from us, Trent! It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man! I am ''not'' going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters! Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. Whatever, that's like five years from now. We did it!  Uh oh. Hah! Hey! 
And I'm Rick Cartman. Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.  ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities? All right, Butters, keep your eyes open. Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right. Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip. All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice.  How many students is that? What is that butthole doing now?! Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing. ...You're gay! Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.  God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park. Go play with yourself, Craig.  Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?! It should be Sexy News. Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting. Nice, Butters, write that down! And panda bears for the preschoolers. We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means. Ah, Tolkien, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Tolkien, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Tolkien, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona. You see Tolkien, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... ''Seeing'' African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha-, how should I say... white.  Tolkien, all the great African-Americans news people have learned to ''hide'' their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings. Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls! And now, for a look at the weather, here is Tolkien Black, and Tolkien, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.  Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?  Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters. All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle. Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got skidmarks Monday. It's boring news, Jimmy. All right, tell me about it.  Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about? Oh man, this is ''so'' great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you!  I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade! How about we have us, um... hmmm. Wait, I've got it.  Crab people. They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.  Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies! How about we do a show where we kill Butters?  We have crab people. Just sayin'. That sounds perfect.  Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.  Stan, are you getting good ideas?  Oh dude, I just got the best idea! Dude, this TV show is awesome. I-I did. I wrote something down.   They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse. And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.  Haha! In your face, Craig! This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head.  ...I think bail. 
"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."   Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party. Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me. Kelly Rutherford-Menskin. Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?  Oh, Goddammit! 
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.  ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here. I'm gonna! Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to- Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations. And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight!  Eugh...  Wheh? Where am I? Coma... How long? Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap! Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours! Probably in your front pocket, dumbass! Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch. I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?! How come the outline is missing its hand? Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs! Guess again. Wow! Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks!  Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes? Do not doubt my powers, Kyle! Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought! Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at!  What? I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go! No. Nothing. Wait a minute.  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken! It ''is'' fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae. More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring. Proper channels? I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.  Ten percent, my balls, get lost! Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds! In court? Cool.  Who are you? ... 'Kay. Sweet. Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?! I don't even know you dude! Oh, Jesus. No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!  Heheh. Yes yes, I see!  AAAAAAAH! Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me!  (Hey! Come over here!)  No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested. Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability. You can't hurt me. 
I don't believe anyone interrupted ''you'' when you read ''your'' Christmas story aloud, Kyle.  Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?  Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends. That's not at all what happens.  "Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat. 
This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball. Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time. Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball! Jesus, that's no fun. You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties. He's a ''Jewish'' dolphin. A Jewphin. 
Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic? Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard. Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard.  Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.  God damn hippie!  Get out of here! Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse! The college know-it-all hippies.  All right, in you go. Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced!  What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why! Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it. And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints  Please, I have to talk to you all right now! Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over! I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're ''thriving'', if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... hippie music festival. It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that lasts for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen.  I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast! It's not pot''holes'' you need to worry about. It's pot''heads''. I know what these people are capable of. What are you doing?!  I ''knew'' you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to my basement!  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?! Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'd expect the same from you.  Everybody get in a single-file line! Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted. What? You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them! No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay!  What did I do?! They're not people, they're HIPPIES!  Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!  You... You what? They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?! You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!    How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippies!  Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.  Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.  It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!  Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer. I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot. Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch ''me'' drive ''mine'' around the school parking lot and get super-jealous! All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and be super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?!  All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick. In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. Our only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all. We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. The pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside. Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got. I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Primary engine running? Navigation systems? Let's punch this baby.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status? Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that? Come on, come on! No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there! ...All right, fine Chef, go! Hit the PA system NOW!  You're the scientist, jackass! Put them in my laptop!  Hold it right there, Kyle!  ''Kill'' you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you, Kyle. Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh, sorry! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool! 
Of course he sings. He's black. Two hundred dollars. You wanna know what it is, guys? That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.  Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Tolkien is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star. So, why shouldn't ''we'' get some of that money? We can be Tolkien's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes! We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Tolkien think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.  Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Tolkien there. Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Tolkien back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk. Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Tolkien sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.  Oh hey, Tolkien! Buddy, my man, what is up?!  Hey, you know, I heard you were doing something down in Denver tomorrow night. Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Tolkien? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you. This will only take a second. Welcome to our offices, Tolkien. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Guys, you remember Tolkien. He's thinking about becoming a client. Now, Tolkien, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?" Right?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now. I'll I'll call you back, Abe.  I'm making it look like important people call us.  ...well Tolkien doesn't know that. How?! Jew!  Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we? Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?  From now on, we are an entertainment team, Tolkien. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us. We represent Tolkien.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal. Two hundred dollars, Tolkien, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is... Sweet! You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency. Tolkien, you signed with us! What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby! ...Oooo... ...Goddamnit!  This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!  You've ...already done all the work? We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us.  Excuse us! Dude, how long is the wait? Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is. Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken. Stupid assholes!  Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well? Come on, Wing! She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.  Gay. Your gift of hope is a great deduction.  Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.  Four thousand dollars?  That's four hundred for us! We did it!  ''Who let the dogs out?'' ''Who let the dogs out?'' ''Who let-?'' Naw, sh-she was with you!  Wing? Wing? Wing? Here, Wing! Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back. Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients! Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls. Oh my God, you guys. Look!  Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!  Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it! Aw aw guys, come on! Tolkien, you're... waiting tables? Aw man, that's too bad, Tolkien. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop!  
Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!  Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go! I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  WHAT THE HELL?! Kenny, when did you get here? Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line. Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out! YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!  JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!!! ''(looking bored)'' Fags!  Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the ''man''? Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?  Yes! Well... well then he's NOT alive. That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar? Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube. Um, it was um, this one time... Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this! Did so! Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right. I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF. That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.  He's right in here. That's right. Respect our authoritah. I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato! You say Kenny, but I say tomato!  What? 
 We're done! No more baseball! All right, we did it!  Post-season? Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals! All right, hit one out of the park!  Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it. All right!  Ball. Balll.  That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery! What?!  How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first! What happens if we win the State Championship game? Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team. Exactly right, Clyde. So what ''we'' need... is to find somebody to join ''our'' team, who totally sucks ass. I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!  We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose! 
Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!  She's got Colonel! Oh boy! Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy? Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.    Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes? Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  I can't be dead!! No! No!! Oh my God, this can't be happening!   Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?! ...What did you say? Butters...  Butters! You can see me?? Oh my God, and you can hear me?? Because, Butters, I'm... dead.  Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you! I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides. I don't know, but you're the only one who can. Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help! Butters... Butters, you have to help me! All right, Butters, you leave me no choice.   Butters. Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me! Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven. What do you mean? I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?! Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you. This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!   Tell her, tell her that I love her.  Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!  It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted! Just the good times. I can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!  Okay, that takes care of Tolkien, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's everyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.  Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now. Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.  Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on? What else do I have to do?! Atone?  Not really... Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it. I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jews exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid. Really? I know how. Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right. Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right! I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny?  Butters. Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here. I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do! She's gonna close soon! Come on!  Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time! I told you, Butters.  Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day! All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages. Don't worry. I have a plan.  They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead.  Yes, it's working!  Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day. My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends. We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.   You sonofabitch Butters! You told me I was a ghost! How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  
Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?! No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.  Up yours, Butters. Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man? Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food. Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times. I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener. Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.  Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.  Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."  All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right." All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful." Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice. Aaagh!  D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say "That's the bad guy!" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!! 
Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around. You know how? Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box. Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.  Awesome. We're not moving. Maybe you have the parking brake on. Other way! Other way! Stan... beaver dam!   Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble! I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about. Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at ''my house'' all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail!   Yeah. Shyeah, that was pretty funny. Hehey, no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault! Well they should've gotten out of there! We did! Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this! Oh hey, Kyle.  Hngh, totally.  Aw crap!  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?! Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?! Why?  "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility." Help! Help!  Not so fast, Kyle. Hand over the gold! You know what I'm talkng about! All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!  I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now! Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle! I want... your Jew gold!   Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God!  ...Aw man.  Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe. 
[''closes the door and comes downstairs''] Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge. What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future. Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true. . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children. Video playback initialized.  Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.  How is the incubation shield coming Clyde? Good man.  Any luck here? Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here. Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over? Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it. No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town. No, not like ''Juwanna Mann'', Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that! Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.  Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters.  Okay. One! Two!  Nice.    Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it. Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.  God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it. That son of a bitch! Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?! You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device. Working on what?! Your dance moves?! Just do what you were sent to do, dickface!  Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go!  aahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us!  Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future.  No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions. Because I do, Clyde. I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty? Will you all shut up so I can do this!? Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!? Think of the power! Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future. Damn, Ken. 
I broke the egg. I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg. ...No. No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us. Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!  Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before. ...Why are you doing this? What do you want from me? ...No.  Yes teacher. 
 This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls. Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  vampires. I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions. Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Informative if you want to die.   ''-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille'' <br /> I'M GINGER! Help me! Hellp mee! And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this! So I'm gonna stay like this forever? Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Mom?! Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys? Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency. Actually, gingervitus is the medical term. Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal. What do you mean, Kyle?  That's fine, just get it out of the way...  I'm grubbin'. What's it look like? Huh? But... it's me. Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside.  I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap! Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are! ...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Liiike... Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand... Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride! Red Power!  Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!  Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Better red than dead! Better red than dead! That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized! The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do! There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!  Can I get a Red Power? Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is! Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are!  We're fine, thanks. We're fine! You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and ''exterminate'' them! Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?! My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us!  What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled!  No, we're fine! Thank you! Yes! We're good! You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  We will start... with the daywalker! Go on then! Say your last words! Okay fine, let him speak!   What have we become? D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together. Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like. See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live.  ... Huh? Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated. That's it! You've got it! ''Live together!'' ''The same, you and I!'' Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people! 
Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again! HA! Saving money, duhhh!  Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex. Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars. Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag.  Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you.  
I'm all wet! Sweet! Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!! Yes! Yeehehehes!  I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30. Why? Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares? Killer.  Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine.   Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go! Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man. Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale. You live on the moon? Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon? Yeah, we just have to keep him wet. He hasn't said a word since we brought him here. Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch. We have to hurry! Uh oh. Oh crap! There's more of them!  Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now.  
Ichi banzai Ichi banzai! Kya! I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here. Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine! Yeah, let's go. Sure, whatever dude.  Dude, what the hell is he doing? You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine! Man, that was such a bummer. Why? All right, Stan. Sure.  
I'm gonna miss him.   All right!  Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you? Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.  Excuse me? ...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex. Yeah! Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs.  Oh, son of a bitch! No, Chef has always been super-cool. So what can we do?? Come on, bitch! Dance! Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off! It's ok Chef, Go on, remember! Look, If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?! Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash! Run Chef! A mountain lion!  A grizzly bear! Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your- Oh never mind. 
 Who?  Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle? You guys, this is ''our'' party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! ''Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!''''' Dude, what are you doing? THAT's gay, heh. Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?  Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football! You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew. No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole! Who?  The smug?  I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits. You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength. I'm not doin' it for Kyle.   Butters, are you there?! I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL? Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store. Turning right at O two four niner.  Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?! Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go! Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!   Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle? We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat! Ah, that's better.  
You TiVo every episode of ''Family Guy''? Yich.  Yich. Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool. What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?! That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?! I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't. Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of ''Family Guy'', not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy? What? Goddamned ''Family Guy''! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they ''want'' a holy war! You guys, this is serious! We have to do something! We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me? Then we'll ride our Big Wheels. If that's what it takes, yes! We ''have'' to talk to the network! The ''Family Guy'' writers aren't gonna back down! Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle? All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because ''Family Guy'' just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  Come to try and stop me?!    Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time. You know we might not even make it into the studio. So what made you change your mind? Well Kyle, we'd better get going. Are you set? All right, let's roll!  Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, ''Family Guy'' will be off the air forever. It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show ''they'' don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand ''another'' show get pulled. And so on and so on, until ''Family Guy'' is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley. Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.  Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like ''Family Guy'', right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of ''Family Guy'', Cartman."  I am NOTHING like ''Family Guy''! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled!  Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw? Kyle, stop it! Holy Crap!  Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!   This... explains everything.  Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle! 
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Kyle, stop it! So long, Kyle! Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away. It's regarding ''Family Guy''. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG! Dude, can I go before you? So... you don't like ''Family Guy'' either, huh? So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air? Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air. Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to ''scare'' the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want. ...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism. This is manipulation at its highest level; you should let me handle this. Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done? Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him. Seeya.  Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow... You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  Ow.. I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.  Yes, and then ''Family Guy'' is as good as dead.  It won't take long, sir.  Ow...  Yes, I'm totally excited. ''Family Guy'' is so funny.  What are they? ''Family Guy'' is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now. Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk! Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you- Why not?  Son of a bitch.  Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well. You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate ''Family Guy''. Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the ''Family Guy'' writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in. Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like ''Family Guy''. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.  Sir, ''you'' are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge. I did it. I... AM... ''GOD''!!! ''Family Guy'' is going off the air! No more ''Family Guy'' for me, mon frère! How the hell did you get out? Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?! You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! ''Family Guy'' is as good as dead!  I can't let you do that!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it! Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle!  Stop it! Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay! Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the ''balls''!  Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing! No! Think about the people who could get hurt! Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now! Shut up, Kyle! Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President! No gay speeches, Kyle! No! No, I hate ''Family Guy''!!  
 Kyle, you can't block like that. Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!  Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Dude, what are you doing? No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig. Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy? Ah I don't think so, dude.  You... have that kind of power? Somebody get us some help down hyah! Hello??  You'd better get us out of here, asshole! You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!   Tr... treasure. I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now!  You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out.  I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down. No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead. That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump. I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.   Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'? Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good? Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around.   Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.  Beh. NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die.  Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here.  You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!!  Yes you do!  No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys! Grab my hand. I can't kick! I can't! Kick yourself back to safety! No, you just have to save me.  No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.  It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away! That's right, and I...  Fake treasure? Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW! Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww! Eh!  
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole. Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg. Well he called me chubby! Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry! Sure you do. You're a great mom.<br />''Who's got the greatest mom in the world?<br />I dooo.<br />My mom is number one in my heart.<br />It's true!''   Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door! Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now.  Mom, I want a Twinkie.  Ha! Hahahahahaha!  No thanks, I'd rather naught. The hell do you think you're doing? Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch! Time out?  And what exactly keeps me on the stool?  Ummm, no? All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now. I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move. ''[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.'' Because you took my Xbox. Well, yeah. Yeah. I guess so. Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny. Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy? Why not? You're sterile, is that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless. Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile!  You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake. Not interested in me? Yeah, well I don't see why- Hey! Mom, this guy doesn't- Ah! Quit it! Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can- KNOCK IT OFF! I'm not fat! Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch? Mom, this is degrading! Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh!  Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm. Mom, seriously, people are seeing me! Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now? Mom!  God dammit stop ignoring me! This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention! Quit it, mom! Ooo, Colonel? Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken. Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken! Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please? Suck my asshole, taco vendor! Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over! You can't do that to me, I- Goddamnit, you just can't- Seriously! Ey? Eh...   I hate you! I'm running away! Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow. Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street! All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you. Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man. Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now. You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets. ...Should that really matter at a time like this? This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her. All right, I'm back. Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here. That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat. Aw, Goddammit! What is he still doing here?! What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz! Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services!  Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you! I am your son, and you ''will listen'' to me! You have no right to- Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th- Seriously! Mom- Seriously! Why are you... doing this-? Mom?! Mom? Mom... Who does she think she is, telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me? Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom. She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes. Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out. She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom. Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face. Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?! Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face. Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself! You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.   No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want! She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being. Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes ''are'' good for me. Maybe...  Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham. Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started. Tha... thank you? 'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez.  I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now.  No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then. Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers? 
 Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys? Okay, I'm back. Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump! Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl! Heheh, totally, heheh. Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth! Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half of these people are Koreans. Get out of here, asshole! Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  That son of a bitch! He's a God damned butthole! My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters. We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance. Clyde, Clyde!  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but ''you'' would, right? When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde? Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde? (Would you like to sleep with me, Clyde?) All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to ''victory''! Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time! Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you. All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff. The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards. This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with- Butters? What the hell are you doing? You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf. So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!  Everyone hold!  Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Goddammit we lost Clyde! No, leave me alone, don't do-  What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?! Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft. I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if ''we'' were super-high level too? That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars. There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow. Yes.  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters. Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it! All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!  Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence. Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have? Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks. Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom? More Hot Pockets! All right, everyone ready? Let's go get him!  Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan. Command-0.  Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout. Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle. Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time? Christ... Everyone target scorpions. Kyle! Fire spell! Wait, we need Ben-Gay.  I'm going as fast as I can! All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh... It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom! Bathroom! Bathroom!  All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow. Kyle, cast arcane missiles! Stan, what the hell are you doing?!  His shield and armor spells are down! Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Yes! Yeah! All right, yay. We did it you guys. We're totally heroes. What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game. Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots. 
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11. Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle? They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again. Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?! Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards? ...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters!  Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup? Aha! Do you see? I rest my case. That's right, Butters. What? People see the truth? You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  It is wrong for me to ask questions?<br />Is it wrong to seek the truth?<br />I just can't blindly accept their version.<br />I can't base my logic on proof.<br />Almost all the evidence points one way,<br />But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:<br />I need to know what really happened<br />On 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.<br />What really happened<br />On 9/11?[He's back at his computer once more and clicks on his mouse]Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?  Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!   but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane? So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? . Kyle! Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole. 
And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there. What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar! Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!  I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!! Aw Goddamnit!  I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish? The hall monit- me?  Auth- authoritah? Ahem. Me? That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!  You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!   Argh!  What the fuck is this?!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?! I found this in the hallway.  Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway!   Hands?! Let me see those hands!  Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah! I ''knew'' it!  Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right? Here, you need a smoke, brah? You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah. Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah.  Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright? Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool. What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee. Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg. Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with. They what??  Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy! Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg! Hall infraction!  You got a hall pass, brah?! Yeah? Well, where's ''his'' hall pass?! Get down on the floor!  You like bear mace, icehead?! You're goin' with Christ!  ...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person. Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass. I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her. You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch! You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean.  Oh no! I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense. There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?! No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning. I had Beth check out their Travelocity account. Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?! Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out!  Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!  It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty! You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here! I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg! Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me! I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!  Keep your mouth shut, brah!! Praise Christ! Let's go!  Bear mace that guy! And that guy!  Freeze, bitch! It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan. Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!  Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement. That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times. See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face.  I've done it lots of times.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else. I am not!  Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out! Dude... You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues How do you know?? How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him? 
 I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!  No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand. Noo!! Nooo!! How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?! Oh God...  Okay, how long now?  HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH! Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!  Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer? Oh God! Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!! You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me. I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.  No. There ''is'' something I can do. All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it. Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me. It's simple science, Kyle. I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!! I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself!   Ey! Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!  No! No, it's too soon! Butters, get your coat. We gotta go. You're gonna help me freeze myself.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?! No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right? All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!  Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze. Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do. Where am I? Safe where, butthole?!  What?? Butters? Butters, you black asshole?!  Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii? Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe! I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii! No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future.  What??  YES!! YES!! So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go! I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.  And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how? Who?  Who are they?? Jesus Christ! I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii. What?? 
Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.  Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere. Over here!  Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans.  I got it! I got the Wii!   Get out of my way! Here.   Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play! There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future! You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-dammit! I am so fucking sick of the future!  I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut! Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood. God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials!  Tell me about it.  What? Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?! Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to ''freeze'' myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii. I care! Where's the closest toy store?? Come on! Come on! Ugh, finally! I want one of those time-phone things. Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people. Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?! Look, I have to have one of those phones! How about a robot? How much for the robot?  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records? I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week. Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.   Oh God!  Who is this? What?? Who the hell is this?! Me who?! What?! Oh very funny, Kyle! Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself. Listen to this!  Butters?! Come on, we gotta go! Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark! What??  Who the fuck is this?! Suck my balls! ...Okay, you have one minute.  Are you spying on me?! Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going! This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?! What is the Great Question? I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?! Who? Garrison? But he's an asshole. It's an emergency! It's an emergency! I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now! Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation! Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison!   Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism? So there is no war now in the future.  And what was that purpose again? Right...  I'll miss you too, KOK-A-3. Hoowww-  I'm back. Wow! I'm back! Mom! Mom, they did it!  No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out. What? NO!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over! I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this! Hello? ...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle!  
Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen! I watched it on YouTube about sixty times! Yeah, well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Tolkien.  He is gonna wanna kick your cracker teeth in. Ohhhhhhhh? Oh, shit, here we go!   Yeah, come on! Here we go!  Race war! Come on! Race war! Tolkien forfeits!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again! No! Dude! No fucking way!   Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha... Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him.      Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry! Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?! Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha! It's a midget, dude. Hahaha, no- no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much.  Say "Uncle!" Hahaha, now say "Carol Anne, don't go into the light!" Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh! 
This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one. Oh no, there's much more.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass. Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to- Heh!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.  Weren't you guys? Kyyyle! What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life. Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon. Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God! It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth!  I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good! Because that makes Butters gay now! Eh- ...what?  Nuh uh. Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh? But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys! No, no, it was a stupid mistake! No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How-how can I reverse this? How?  Really?   Butters. Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you. It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever! You ready? Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees! Hang on a second here.  'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?   That's good, just like that. ...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth.  All right, you ready?  Uh!  Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!  I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!  Right, except for you.  Why would you tell anybody? ...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier. Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.   Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody! Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts ''me'' way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody. Oh right, like ''that's'' possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is ''your'' face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Where is it, you filthy Jew?!  You know God damned well what! I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!  Give it back, Kyle! I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here. ''You'' shut up! You're lying, and  NYAAAAAAAAAA! Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski. It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!  Why... why does that matter? All right. It's a picture ...of me. It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth. No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture! Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep. I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell! That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  Ow. OW. OW!  I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow! Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee. Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.  Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have. But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay!   You, you will? It is?   What? Mom, she's lying! Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!  Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh. Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction! HA! , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps? And now this next picture  And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial.  Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft. What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-  ...Lame. 
Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it. Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.  This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home. Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened? Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right? Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?  That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast! All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you!  Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself! Me?! I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what ''you'' would do if ''you'' had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me! That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan.  And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing!  There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it!  All right, lock that door, Craig!  I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.  This is a scientific test, designed to- I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?! If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it ''might'' work and reveal that they were the ones with lice! Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you. All right, now everyone back over there!  Yeah? Let's just see what ''your'' blood does, Kyle!  It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH!  Kenny! Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice!  He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  What, Clyde? All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it! Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?! Guilty! I thought so!  All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks!  Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?! Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?! But that means... that means Kenny ''was'' lying! Sock bath!  
Uh oh!  Duhude, dude, ''[throws out his arms, palms out] not cool!'' Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo. What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs? No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.  Kyle, are you on your computer? Get online. I need you to check something for me. Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger! Get online now! Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.  Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?  Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?  That's funny. He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.  The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.  I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now! If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this? Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.  Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?! Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow! Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce! Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!  What? Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park! He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away! I said I will only talk to the President! LALALALALALALALA! LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA! President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line? Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now! Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid! Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address? Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready? It's my balls!   Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.  Yes, Mr. Thompson? Why? Did you find something?  A snuke?  I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you? Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you.  Big surprise! Let me have time with him. We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!  Where is the detonator?!  I can do this aaall day. You can make it stop! Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!  Where is your son?! Answer it!  Butters. We got him! I know where he is! No no, he's my lead.  You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is!  Uuugh!   Where is the detonator! You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One! Stop, terrorist, or I ''will'' shoot you!  Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore. Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy! That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading. Uhh yes, of course? The Russians? The Germans? The Germans again? You can't possible mean...? Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology. Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool. But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right? Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America. Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?! Yes or no, Kyle?! But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right?  Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice. 
And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?! Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you! Bye, Easter bunny!  
Have you lost your mind? You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay. No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things. ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? ¿Sí? ¿Trabajo?  "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "E Old Mand Y La Mer". Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia. Okay, gracias. Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass. They'll be done.  All right, did you read the book? All right, did you write the four essays? Okay, let's have 'em. Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?! Crap!  Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports. That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian! 
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.  Get out of here! No, Kyle's right, you guys. We ''should'' do something. Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do. Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready? All right, here we go! Jimmy?   Yes! There's a bunch outside my house too. No! Fuck off!  Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible! You what?!  Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle! You see what you did, Kyle?! They're everywhere!  Aw man, it ''really'' smells like Kenny's house down here. Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together. All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof. I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people. I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty. Cool. Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny. Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town. Youu heard about that? Thirty was hard enough. Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town. Let's hope to Christ this works.   <poem><i>California<br />Supercool to the homeless</i></poem> <poem><i>Californiania<br />Na na orn nea</i></poem>  
 That's pretty kewl. Let's see...  The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-   Are you talkin' to me?! What's your problem, kid?! What?  Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?  All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble? ''Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance]'' haha. HahaHAAhahahaha.  I don't need the toy! I've found something better! ''[dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!'' Puh- pussy! Pussy! Cock! Shit!  Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls!  ...Cocksucker! Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls! But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say. Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. ''Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look]'' Shit! Butthole!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface! Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition. ...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble. Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle. Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy!  Dicktits! Shit! Asshole!  Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness. Tampon! Tampon DICKshit! Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE. Kyle please! I'm sorry! That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina! Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle. You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it? Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fag Jew! Jew bitch! Thank you. Big-nosed kike!  Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!   Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.  Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?  Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy. Then the game is on, Kyle.  Uhh nuh-nothing... Hm. That was... weird.  And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  What the hell is going on? No hey ut what, what I ''meant'' to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh,    Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say? Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it!  Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!  Ah, I need to be going now.   Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show. My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine. No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.  But I'm not gonna do the- I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show? You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say. No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!   How does he do that? Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you ''especially'' can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle. Kyle? Kyle, what are you doing? Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle! I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man! You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  
All right, let's try over here.   Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy? Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out.  O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie? Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position!  Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you ''must'' suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you.   Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot! Faggot, I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five. It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!    Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!    Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening? Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes. Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth. We had a deal, Kyle!  You signed an agreement, Kyle!! Thank you, Mr. Broflovski. And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and ''still'', my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!  Yesss! Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls. Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives. He has to. He's been ordered by the court. What? Move aside, move aside!  Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls. Yehehehesss. Yehhhs!   No! No, he has to suck my balls!  Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger. I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  
  (echoing) Aaaaahhhh... NO! I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time. Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?! Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!  Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?! That kid you have made a bet that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!  validated by the United States court system! Theee conference room is which way?  Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you. Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls. Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.   extra vinegary... I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think? No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth? In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually-  Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet. No! Goddammit, no! No! Kyle can't die.  Kyle?  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!  Do it! DO IT!  Come on buddy. Come on buddy.  Wake up, Kyle.  
 Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling? What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I ''could'' prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.  let's see Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  My balls! Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?  Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame? ...What? Where are you going?! Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.  We had a DEAL KYLE! IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!  What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?! You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real? Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?  No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit! Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything! Kyle? So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle.  You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.  O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls!  O-hoo Kyle, you are ''gobbling'' those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle? No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real. Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls.  
Stan, you guys are good!  Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh. Real guitars are for old people.  Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points! Oh my God this is so awesome. All right, Stan, you've got it, man! Come on guys. Let's get out of here.  Stop cheating, Craig!  'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole! What? Butters, you wanna play me next?  
 They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?  Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about. Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you! No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor. Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married. All right, Bebe, let's see the list. You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class! Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him? Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them. All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right? She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  At 1 PM tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls. Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good? Bail, bail!  Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls. Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground. Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention!  We got it! We got it!  Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door!  What?! That's bullcrap!  You're last, dude!  Yes way! Check it out!  So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm better looking than you!  Kyle?  
AHHHHHH. What? No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom! No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all! ...Ice cream? Well...you did say ''free'' ice cream?   Uh. It's over?  Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom! All right, so where's my ice cream? You were right, doctor! Everything is okay! What's that supposed to mean?! I HAVE AIDS? "''Sorry''"?! You gave me AIDS and you're "''sorry''"?! Mom, you said nothing would go wrong! No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!  Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE! NO! ''NOOOOOOOO''! God damn it, this sucks ass! Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die! Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it! Where the hell is everybody?  So this is it? Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap! Just bring out Elton John already! Jimmy Buffett?! Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!  Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck! Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS! Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday. Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease. ...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  OH YEAH, it'S REAL FUCKIN' FUNNY, KYLE! NO YOU DON'T! If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any goddamned second, Kyle!  Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?! Ironic how?  Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!  Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!  Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at. Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do. I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.  All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access. Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  Pass me the ball!  Kyle, what the F?! Kyle, what?! Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it? Nothing! Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale.  Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p- Kyle! Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!  Kind of.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle. See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys.   Kyle, where are you going? What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!! Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you! No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope. Break my Xbox and you'll never know. NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson. He was a basketball player. So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!  My God... We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible. Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS. Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason! We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares!  Oh uh, you know, all over cancer. Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease. No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  Magic Johnson, here we come.  I know. I'm scared too. We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. Kyle, we need to try to find a-  I don't think it's funny, Kyle.  Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-  Are you sure?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle! Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk. All right!  What?! Aw, no! What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha. What? No. No.  Kyle, no! 
Yeah, but we totally don't. Aw dude, that's our town! That's enough to buy slaves!  Sweet! We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole!   All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'. 
Cat pee?  All right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine.  Okay, ready Kenny? All right, bring out...! The other male cat.  Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed?   Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny! Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls. Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you? Ah, Kenny!  Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Here. Write a diary. Yeah, who has cats these days?    Who is it?!  Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another. I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more... What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here! Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties. He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude. They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand!  But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong.   Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle. Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life. 
Oh God, I'm bored already. Gayness!  We don't care. *urp* God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!  No! NOOO! We are NOT... resorting to that! How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?  Wait. I've got it. There's more people viewing it! Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob. Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet! Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year. Sweet. I think we're next in line now. ...You are a homo, Butters. 
 Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here. Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!  Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal. Yes!   Yeahhh. Who's teacher?! That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!  Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning. That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me? Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks. Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test. Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk? Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around. Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.  Your new teacher. I am here... to teach you calculuuus. Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu. Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge How do I reach these keeds?  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top. No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy. Go ahead, the door's right there.  How do I reach these keeds? Nice form, compadre.  Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?   Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo! What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing.  Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds? Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me. Good. Again. Again! Now you sound like white people! The answer to #27 is 5. The answer to #28 is 14. All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?  All right, let's go get you an abortion. Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you? Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life. Mexicans are told not to cheat. "Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child." So then ''you'' have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest. Uh what? Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them. How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives. You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.  I reeached these keeeds. 
Let's be partners, Kenny. Okay.  Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.  Uh who else needs a partner? God damn it! That isn't necessary! You can let go now, Butters. Butters, come on! I wanna shoot an Indian. Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything! Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme! Fine, then let go of my hand! Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?! Fine, then you're comin' with me! Butters, let go God-damn it! Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay! All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  One please. Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first? Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars!  Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss! <poem><i>I'm having a super fun time playin</i></poem> Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  <poem><i>''Super fun time, please don't go awahay.''</i></poem> <poem><i>No more worries or cares, super fun time.</i></poem>  Oh man, whoa! Yeheah, we're wired up!  <poem><i>You make my life so right, super fun time.</i></poem> Aw, just a few more things. Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on.  Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village. Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.  Crap, they called the cops on us. They must have realized we left. Damn.  Shhh! Butters! Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this! Butters, l-listen to me, listen. All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along. If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand. Butters? All right, come on!  Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free. Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Go easy. Good. It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP. Save me! ... Oh dude, laaame. Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go! Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump! Ready? Go!  Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters? Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm. Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome. What'd we do? We've been here the whole time. Butters. Jesus Christ!  AAAAH!  
 No! No!  Damn it no! No! Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me!  They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America!  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?  There you are, Butters! Butters, I need your help. The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care! I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now. You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents! Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?  So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!  You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese. All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready? This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country! Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull. Fruttar sheshar.  Do you see them? Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out. They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Oh, herro, prease, herro. So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves. Ting ton teetong. Yeah,  All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?! Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran. What day is American invasion again? I fohget.   ...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull. Oh my God... Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Hold the gun on them Butters! They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me! Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese! Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive! Shoot him, Butters! You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it! Aw dude, you shot him in the dick. That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.  It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just ''weak''. I can't believe you, Butters. Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!   Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  Don't come any closer! We have information that we will only trust with the President of the United States! No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters!  Dude! What the fuck are you doing?! God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?! What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick! ...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it! No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?! Good! Did you kill him?  Dude... Dude!   You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man. I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front. I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  
She said it again.   Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom? Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy! I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison. Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today! Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Not at all.  "Wendy, we're gonna get you, Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!" Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy? Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?  You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.  Whassup? Standing right here, let's go, bitch. You're gonna fight me after school? You're a chick, dude.  Oh, it's on, bitch! She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it. Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass.  Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?  Wendy, I want to apologize, and, um, tell you that-  I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.  Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh. Oh, Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.  Wendy. Wendy, psst. Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs. Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight, then I-  Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.  My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs. Eat my underwear?  Okay. Okay, Wendy, I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now. No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will. I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us. I'm committed to peace, Wendy.   There. Yeahm. So...  are we cool?  Yo, what's up dawg? Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk. You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours. Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch. Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken. You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well, Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone.", but she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man, you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.     Ahhh, sweet. What?! That's ridiculous! That's not why I did it.  Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that. Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.  Huh?  The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool.  Okay, Mommy. Mama, Mama. Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.  What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight. Why not? You chicken?  Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?! I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo. Told you guys.  What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?  Wendy, Wendy. Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard! Butters, get out of here!   Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you. Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time. Alright, fine Wendy! I'll fight you, you big bully!   That's not true! You're just saying that! You're all just saying that to make me feel better. Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you ''do'' think I'm cool.   
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls? What girl is gonna see your balls? Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.  Shut up already! I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  So? How much? Really? Are you sure?  Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys. Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro? Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday? Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.  And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig. Craig, don't be an asshole. And a one, and a two, and a-   Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey!  No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno! No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku] No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui! Ha!  And we're white. You're being extremely negative, Craig.  There's no talking to this guy. 
You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig. Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time. That's right. Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way.  What is it? Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants!  Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs? Dude, it's Craig! Well do you ''mind'' tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig? Yeah, it's coming from up there. Dude, that's awesome.  Dude, Craig, we should go back now.  Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around. Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up! That guy's an asshole! 
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV?  
Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude.  There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!  What the hell are they doing? Dude, girls are such fags.  This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys.  Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends. Ehhhhhhh.  I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on. ...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore.  You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class. Fuck you, Kyle!  Oh God, shut up! Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup! Oh that's good, that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice. No way dude. Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes." "Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."  "That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes." I told you guys. He's been watching ''High School Musical'' over and over again. You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson. That's a low blow, Stan.  <poem><i>But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.</i></poem> <poem><i>Don't stress about it or you just might faint.</i></poem> 
Aw man, you've got to be kidding me.  Goddamn Japs are everywhere. Oh, who just shot me?  Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs. All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are. Yeah, now get out of here. Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch! Butters?  Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey! Dude!  Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor! Yes. 
Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it? Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend. Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.  Butters, what's the problem? That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face! Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's. Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.  He took it pretty well. The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you?   Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!  Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis? Well well well, here he comes. It's B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear. Purity ring?  ''Grey's Anatomy''?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?  Motherfucker! "Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this!  Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes! This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  The hell did you do to us?!  I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said. And knowing is half the battle.}} 
 Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon. I know, right?  "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.  You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you! He's not a fag!  Kenny? And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with ''my'' camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.  Hunh! I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices! I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!  Wha, what?  What?! Fuckin' butthole! You gotta be kidding me!  So, guys! Any of you do anything ''interesting'' last night?! Really?! Nobody was playing with any ''fireworks''?!  Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Unless you ''are'' Mysterion! What?! Why? It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!  Fucking bitch...  Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon! 
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...  Hengh!  Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know! The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-! Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle. I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had ''Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars'' right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...''Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars'' just... melted in my hand.  Did somebody say "catch a Jew"? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is ''Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars'' for handheld Nintendo DS.  Go ahead, Kyle. 
Oh, man, I thought that day would never end. Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode! No! No, nono, you're right, Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny.  Let's get to my house!!   Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig. It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor!  What? What the fuck is this?! Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?! No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?! You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that! Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?!  You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy!  And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly... Yes, that's good. Hey Butters. How you holding up, man? We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on. You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes. Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke. Sick! Stop it, lady! ''It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.'' 
Hey Jimmy, what are you up to?  Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.  Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.  No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else. No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else.  Meh.  Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat? Yeah, I like fishsticks. What, dude, you got something? Yeah. Yeah.  Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys. Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde. Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks? Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?  What are you, Clyde? A gay fish? Tolkien, Tolkien, got a question for you:  Tolkien, do you like fishsticks?  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth? What are you? And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television. Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke. Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated. Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us!   Motherfucker! Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for ''our joke''! Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me! But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do! What?! Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember? Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out? Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together. Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew. It's cool man, it's cool.  Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?  You do?  But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I? Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg? That's cool. You wanna write some together?   Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks. Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... "Do you like fishsticks?" So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?" It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all!  Thanks you guys! Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over. Hi Ellen.  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you. Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you. Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important.  Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get ''me'' started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that ''we'' came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia. Uhhh excuse me?  Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials. Yeah, that was kewl huh? Whassat? So... here it is. That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as ''you'' did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy! Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself! Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?! Hello Jim.  What are you up to? Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up.  Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy. Thanks.  Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it. You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault. Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now. All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things. I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that. 
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of! Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Somalia. North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath. I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want. Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle. Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow. Then why don't ''you'' wanna go? That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Avast there, mateys!  Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house! There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh! Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r? But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here. Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'! We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!

What's going on? Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well! Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club. "It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome." Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home. Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm. Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog! That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle! What?! Clyde!  You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old! Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an entire pirate crew willing to do anything for me! Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever!  The FUCK?!}} 
'Sup, Jew? HA! What a dumbass! Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays! Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays? The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him! That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time. Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can. Because he was a great person, Kyle. ...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call... Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter. Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.  Oh my God... poor Billy Mays... Billy Mays!  It's him! Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays! Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!  I believe I was.  Yes! Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  A child... and a female. And white. Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it! God I hope this works. Hey, what the F?! Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle. So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle. Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear? What if you didn't have to give it up? I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today. Yeah! Alright!  Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest. 
Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, your turn Craig. Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine. Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl.  Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today. Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle? Atta boy Butters! Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks? Dude, we've created a monster. 
Oh my God, dude, this is sooo awesome! Oh, sweet!  This is awesome! Dude! That was so badass! The fuck is this?! I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads! All right! The Rad Russian. You capitalist swine, I'll crush you! Huh? Okay... The fuck is this?! Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?! That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay! Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys.  The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap. Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair. Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again. Alright are you ready to try this, guys? Alright, let's start wrestlin'.  You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw!  Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!  Wait for it, wait for the whore line. And just what do you care about your pitiful country?! I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you! Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now. It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it.  Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them. I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?!  Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay? Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.  You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing! We just received a letter from the WWE. "Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth." Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before. Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler. Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking. And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again. Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Tolkien, Butters, Jimmy. Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, ''every time'' I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Tolkien? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen! Right? No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances. Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it! Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys. It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts. Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go! Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go! Thank you.  Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself? Yeah, this guy crushes.  Alright, places everyone.  My man can do whatever he wants. You're just gonna have to deal with that. My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic. Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now! You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong! O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky! Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico! Hey, what about us? Our show?  This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act! Oh, don't start with me, Kenny! Kenny! I'm-}} 
What do you mean? This song is sweet. I'm not too busy, Stan. No, I just don't care. At all.  Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales! Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! ''[his sweater has "SAVE THE WHALES" on it, while Kenny's parka now has "DOLPHIN LOVER" on it].'' What dude? We always have. That's not what we said. We were talking about Wales the country.  I ''deserve'' to be on TV.  Your show is fuckin' gay, dude! , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures. Shhh, Kenny...  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything. Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese.  Dude, you know what? Japanese people ''really'' do not like whales.  Uh oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess! Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go? What dude? Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me. So that's what this has all been about? Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out. 
Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind? God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of assholes on their Harley motorcycles show up?!  Piss off, you stupid assholes!   You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right? You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right? No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags.  But Cartman isn't letting up on him.  Agreed. Ni-nice, okay. What? I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.  Yeah, I think that'll be nice. I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy. That was us! Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right? Oh, they think we meant gay fags. Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard? You call them "bike-curious". Oh yeah, nice, Kenny.  Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country. Emmanuel Lewis, huh? No! That'll just make you bigger fags! Oh it's over, it's finally over!  
Oh. My. Goodddd. Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?  Who are you? Mr. Mackey, what's a moronic jizzrag? Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?  Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed in to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners. But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions! You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria? Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once! Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?! You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed! Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting! Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school. - of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole - Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video. Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs. I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something. "Thank you" and this is to..?  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy. Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school. Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book. That'll be five dollars. A book signing. I do not directly say she's a slut!  You didn't read the rest, dude. "Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it! You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria? Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about? And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?! Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey! Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! I'm walking out and I'm never coming back!  Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being allowed to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion. Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland. And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool? Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy. People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning. Of course. That's why we're here. Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show. Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it. How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth?  You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth. Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now? If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream?  You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting? Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what? What? What do you mean I know that? No! You wiped them all out! Wait, hold on, can we take a break? Dude, you can't take my ''Dances with Smurfs'' idea and turn it into your own thing- No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours! You sold the movie rights to who?! Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!  Huh! No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader! I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded!  I'm doin' the best I can! }} 
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year. No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities. You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off. Come on, let's go!  Six adorable children, please. Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!   Just do it in English!  You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions! I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? And there are a hundred and ninety black people! So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty-three! There are actually more minorities here than us! ...What do you mean? The black and brown people. Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year! Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this! The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening! You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least ''you'''ve got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan's prediction from coming true, buddy? Help! Help! Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.  It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo...  I read ''Treasure Island'', because I was so happy when I saw that movie. ...because I was so happy when I seen that movie. Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder. Well, I do just as much work. Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether. Noooo...  Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all ''did'' survive! Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived? It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest! 
 Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox.  Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash!  Oh dude, was that a combo move? Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie. Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time. I told you this game was sweet, dude. Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that? Oh, you're going down, Elin! Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up? Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone?? What the hell?! This game's all boring now! Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?! 
 Aww, books? God, I hate those! Oh really? Sweet. Oho man, I can't wait! No on, come on, let's read it now! Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies?! Can we please read this right now?! Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!" They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity!  We know, we were just saying that. It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene! Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one. The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass. It was a... a warm spring morning.  Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny! ...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all. And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down! Butters, what are you up to? Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it. Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night! That's right. Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?! Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit! That inconsiderate jerk! There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact! There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly! All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker. Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned. Shhh.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed. Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.  See any hunters yet? Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there. So what? Oh dude, sweet!  People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter! What?! Oh come on! Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters. That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.  You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter. Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you.  
 Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.   Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips! Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uhm sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole, Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are! Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?! They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park! This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP! Mom, drive faster! Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG! WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit! Fuck you! No! No, what's going on?!  No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too! You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?! Nooooooooo-!    Really? Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?! Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!  Oh God, oh God it's so good. Yeah. Who isn't? Billy Miller? Seriously?? Tommy said you have some KFC. Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Where did you get that?! 85 bucks?? I don't have that!  How much KFC are we talking? Holy fuck, dude. Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime? Are you Teabag? Cut the crap. You got the stuff? Extra crispy?  You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy! IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT!  You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!  Like anybody wants KFC without gravy! Nothin', it's cool. Yeah I got the stuff.  Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here.  Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel? Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles? I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want. Who? You mean Tommy?  Wait, where'd he go? Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked. Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you! Good.  Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!  Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand! ...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer. I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test. Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys? Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good. Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker! What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker. Colonel, how are you doing?  We had a little problem.  Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that? Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time. Hey, take it easy Colonel.  
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle! 'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.  Stupid Facebook stuff. Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you. Surprise!  Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy. Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle! You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him. Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip. It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette? Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette. Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect. Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello? Okay let's, let's try this one. Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going? This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends. Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy... Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first! Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off... Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there. Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too. 
Wow, coo'...  Chocolate rules! AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew! I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad. Hey, that is Tom Cruise!  Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right? I didn't come for myself. I'm just an escort for another celebrity who wants to get in on your lawsuit... Wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money? Uh, excuse us for a second...  Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing? Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money! If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner. You're a no-good swindler and a too-good thief. We were here for money, not goo! Yeah, so what? So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves. No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez. You just had seven tacos. I'm sorry.  Why are you doing this?  Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore! No, I tried getting one last week! God, will somebody shut her up? I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time.  Let me by... Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner. My father... I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father. How could you know anything about who my family is? If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, then you'd better- Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father? I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat. I said GET. Mr. Hat! Put it on!  Do the voice. Keep... your hand... UP! By who? Goddammit, Garrison, who is my father? 
That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!  Ahaaa! Nice work, Conner. Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door! Them who?! Then start explaining it to me! No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is! It's all that matters! I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is! Who you calling stupid, Jew? Gingers? No! Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I? Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth? Hello? I'm here, whoever you are.  Daddy?  Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be. Scott Tenorman. Eeewww. What do you know?! Mom? Protect who?? My dad was a Denver Bronco? No- nooo. No! Noooo! Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means? My dad was a ginger! I mean, obviously, I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me! What? Cheer up? I'm half ginger! Hey, you're right. That ''does'' make me pretty cool. Really, Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go? Take it easy, Conner.  
 Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-. I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today? If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom.  
 Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay? It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us. I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?!  Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!   No I can't; I'll always be like this.  Come on you guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes!  I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be! Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny! You love NASCAR huh? You see I told you guys!   Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.  Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Butters. Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched! But  psyched up?? Get really psyched up, Butters! I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold! I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can. Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money? I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of ''Two and a Half Men''. Not yet. Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?! Fucking gross!  we need Vagisil! "Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes." Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters. I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget? Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Is anybody coming? Mm, 'kay, Mm.  Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid! Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now. Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!   Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR. Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters. What's that? Oh okay.  Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet!   All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.  Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself. I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough. Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this. Aw donkey balls... Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better. Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough? Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again.  Oh hey, Kenny!  Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.   Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do! Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth! I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit. Yeah? ...Uh oh. Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits! Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR! Aww coool, huh Kenny?   Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left. Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes. Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes! Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?! Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us. Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  He's fuckin' gay as hell!  So y'all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell! Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?  NASCAR! Yee-ah! Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake!   Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey! Oh yeah, I see it.   You see that? Daynicuh Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off! Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang! ''"[Cartman made it back on the track]"'' I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!  Get off my car, Kenny! We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!  Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car. Fuckin' gay as hell.    No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it.  I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.  The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back! Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over! 
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep. Oops, busted.  Aw, crap, there's more of them? You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!  Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him. Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey! So what?! That makes ''you'' from Jersey!  Let's just get away from him. Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three! You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!  Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to ''look'' like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange! Yes, it is. It's getting oranger. Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a ''lot'' more! What the hell are you guys doing?!  And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy! Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?! Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!  Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?! So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open. I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now! This is ''very'' serious, Butters. Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up. Come on, you guys, hurry! I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out. Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle! Nuh-uh. Seriously, nuh-uh. Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!   Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. ''[rushes up to the freezer door] ''Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted. Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?! You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!  Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me? What does it want?! No! You guys, it's raping me! ''It's raping me!''  Thank you, Kyle. Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster. 
So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth.   Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk.", you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude. 
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives? I need to speak with him, please. I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir. Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.

This must be amazingly exciting for you.  ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away. Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!   Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them. Asshoooles!

My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers. 
 This is the last fucking straw!!! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!!!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!!!! No, I didn't do a damn thing!!! Nothing!!! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES!!! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!!! Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, huh?! No!!! Not this time!!!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?! Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!!! Yeah they fucking did, Kyle!!! Because they don't fucking care!! I've told you this!! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!! Go look for yourselves!!! There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?! Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: "Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches"!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast! No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.2 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty! They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with! Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said. Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there. Butters, I don't have time for this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle. Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters. Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What? What, Kyle? I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top.  Yeah, it's pretty good. Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?! Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead!  There, you see? My wiener ''isn't'' 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea! Oh, Goddamnit! Let me guess: I'm in trouble again! For what?! Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?! I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!!! You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's 0.2 inches bigger than you said!!! What? Those weren't our dick sizes? I don't know! Why would you?!  Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?! Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it? Fuck you! No I don't! Honestly, I wouldn't really care.  I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. Why the fuck am I here?! Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?! Oh, that's cool. My penis is 13 inches long. Yeah dude!  Yeah! Burn it down, dude!  The Jews! No, and fuck Kyle! Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want! Wait, what?  Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener! I'm still fucking angry! 
Oh. Hey Kyle. I'm volunteering.  I'm volunteering my time, Kyle. I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Ah, crap!  Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital. What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, ''and'' give them a future as well. Crack baby basketball.  We could actually really use you! Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Kyle, hold on a second! What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?! We made a thousand dollars in eleven days.  Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a ''little'' ball of crack. Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time. After you.  Come on.  We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day. It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials. Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert. We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights. You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free.  Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you. Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm.  Betsy MacIntosh? We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again? We need to speak with you, ma'am.  And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?  We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?  Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's. Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules. I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the- Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states "benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being." I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters?  It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!  Hey Kyle. Have a seat. Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man? They can't make money. It's against the rules. Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing. What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?! We're a non-profit company, Kyle. Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look.  It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it.  Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy. A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this "poutine". It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.  Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade. My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.  You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks. Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- "student atheletes" then? I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right? But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves. You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal! How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?! Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address! Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn! ...What? Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle! This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our "student athletes" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work!  What? Vunter Slash? But then, who played at my eighth birthday party? But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses? Are you fucking serious?  You knew about this?? I just can't believe Slash isn't real, I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.  
Alright now, open presents! Open presents! Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine? Yaaaay!  What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get? Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh? Stan's getting another present, Mom. Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan? Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom? Turn it off dude! Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him! He's lying, dude. Hit X What's that? Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle. Look like ice cream to me. ...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny.  Oh cool, the movie trailers! That looks pretty good. Stan, knock it off! No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude. Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head!  
Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas! Yep! Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded? Wait what? Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers? You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers! Okay, you're on, Jew!  Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers?  That's right, it's a butt fungus. ''Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-''  Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me. Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns! I-I'll try. I'll try.  A what?? Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers?? What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers! Well I'm glad ''you'' think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!  Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!  I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter! Really? Gee, thanks Kyle! Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful. There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips. How are we doing on those patties, Jew? Nice! It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer. I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Everything alright here, Kyle? We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon. Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer. The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier!  
 There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them! Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right, patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!   Ha ha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican! Hey! Just because I'm Texan, it doesn't mean I'm fat! Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well, you're a fuckin' Jew, Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-! Clyde?!  What the fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through! Ugh, yeah?! Well, you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-! Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?! Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up!  Oh, God!  I'm not pouting! I've just heard all these jokes before! At least I have an asshole, Kyle!   Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers! Where is Butters?  Game on! You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up. You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too. Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I? Oh dude. Sweet. This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet. Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.  Huh, nothing. Wait a minute, isn't that...  That asshole is not getting across my border!   No you won't Butters! Ey! ¡Respeto mi autóridad!  Where the fuck did he go?!  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you, Kyle!  A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar... 
YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  Seriously you guys, guess what?? You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class? Yeah yeah, Pete Melman! He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans!  Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper! Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?  Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Just listen, listen listen. Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it!  Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman." Oh Jesus, what now?!  Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny!  Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.  Yeah, he killed himself. Hey! Whoooa. 'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone! You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?! Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.  Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done! You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how? Uh, hey Jenny. 'Sup? Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh? So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Uh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes.  I was just thinking that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you. I know. Uh, I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?   You okay, Jenny? Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class.  Uh, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's ''quite'' fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class. Well, just give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp. Oh, my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was! WAY worse! Alright, kewl. You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simons crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made ''her'' the number one story on Eavesdropper!  Nobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die! Jesus Christ!  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those? Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  Okay, well, if you have a better idea, then why am I here?  Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm. Yeah, I think they're all ready. It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever. Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now! Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  No thanks. Okay, proceed. That. Was. Amazing. Boy, I say. It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it. Oh, you're most certainly welcome. Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?  I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those. 
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach! 
Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it.  Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit.  Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope? Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us. Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip. Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%! Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me! Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl. I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault. What do you mean, Peter Panda? Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back. What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you!  Mom, have you been here all day?! Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?! Am I sure?? Look at this place!  Clyde Frog! No.   I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just- Got something to say Kyle?!  How ''do'' you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  ''Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-'' Fly bu-what?  Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. ''Fly fly fly...'' Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! ''Fly to Christ.'' Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me. I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder! What do you mean, Rumpertumskin? Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party. That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue. So then, we are all going to need some... more tea. What the hell?!  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!  Peter Panda! Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!  Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo! This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright. Tolkien, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong. What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants? Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home. Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?! What?! Who?! I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back!  Who's there?!  Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle! Oh sure! Stephen Tamill? The fifth grader?  Where are they Kenny??!! HAAAAGH!   Hello??  Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!!  Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Who did this to you?! Don't worry, I'll get you down! AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this?? Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this? ...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda!  They were your FRIENDS! Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble! There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Tolkien for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything. Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!  Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you. 
Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you?  This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving? Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them. Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today. You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need. Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel? Uh-huh?? Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again? Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report?  Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle?  Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause? Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause. See what I mean, you guys?  Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner? Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving! Oh no. Oh NO! Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store!  You guys have stuffing?! Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it! No! NOOOO! Yeah, History Channel rules.  Ohhh?? 
 That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.  Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers. Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig! Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention.  This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?! Eh yeah?  Heh heh, yeah? What?  Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.  Well I won't give him the satisfaction! Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel! That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want!   Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk. Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household? You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?! Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl!  We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You can't just sit on your ass and expect some money to appear! Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps! IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!!  My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.  It's gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.  Yeah, yeah. That's right. Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?! Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam!  A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?! How?! Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle! Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet? Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent. What??  Greeley? What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house! You're my new mom? Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes? Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?! Oh heell naw!  Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean. You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny!   Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school! Really? Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom is so poor she only understands hand-OUTS.  I wasn't making fun of anybody. I was just teasing. My case worker?  Oh, not this guy! Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes! Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad! I'm not saying it. I'm not saying it! Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!  There he is, there's my buddy.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say "No, I found ooone." 
 Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.  Of course, man. It's cool.  Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die. His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay." I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom. Nuh-uh. Mom, get the door!  Who are these buttholes? My potty? What are they going to do to it?  Hey, hey! That's my bathroom!  Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump. Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine. This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line! Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now! What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls? Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms. Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in. Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right? Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance? Oh boy, here we go. So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot. Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?  
Nice bolo tie, Stan. Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one. No, dude, it's... badass. ...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck. You may suck our collective balls, sir!  I told you guys. I've been watching all day. This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend.   That's right.  Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math! Hey Craig. Goin' on? Tolkien! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-  Butters, what the fuck?! "My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business!  Oh ahhhh, three bucks. We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people. Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the ring just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello? YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...? Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys? Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am. Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!" Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth. Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award. Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!  Yeah, listen, I'm running a resale business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours. I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings. Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there. And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred. How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.  What d'ja say? Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff? Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it! Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you! My balls, my balls, suck 'em dry...  Motherfucker!  You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!  -and then tried to fuck me out of your business! No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies! 
 I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go. Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys.  Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late.  Oh, God. That was boring. Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there. Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation. Why would we look at a newspaper, retard? Really?  Yes! What's it say, what's it say? What? Let me see that.  Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that? You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog.  I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys. How is this Kyle? This good?   Cool, these will be good uploads. Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here? Why don't you make me?  Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  Bad Mr. Kitty! I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting. Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her. Dude, what's going on? Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?  Come on, Kyle. It's okay, man, come on. Get a couple facing the other way, brah.  I know. I know Kyle.  I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  No, no. It was kind of stupid, really. And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff.   Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good? No, kitty, you have to be quiet. No kitty! That's a bad kitty!   Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous! Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time. SHUT UP, KITTY! Let's do this.   <poem><i>We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.</i></poem> 
Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days? Interesting, and why is it called Passover again?  So interesting, wow.  Oh, hey, Kyle. Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton. Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith? Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park. All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.   Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all. Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything. Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter. It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...  Yeah-uh, Tolkien! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!  Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell. Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing. I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence? Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.  Butters. Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera. Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real. Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in. Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here. You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night ''and'' has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  He's here somewhere. JESUS IS A LIE! Shh! Help me call it out, Butters. Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST! No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters? Sh! You hear that? I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us. It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins. I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath.  We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here.  That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank. Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe!  Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it. People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron. These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid! I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra. It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy. Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified. Heh. What do you mean?  Well, I mean it could have just been a dog? Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive. Why? There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle? Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle?   Guys?! Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!  You guys?! GUYS! It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys? Wingstreet?! Dude, I want wings!  Oh Jesus, it's only you! HUH?! Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP! OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-? This isn't safe or fun! NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance. Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble. It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  Bobo?! Bobo, no!   Ugh... what... where... Ugh... what?  What's going on? It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs? So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle. Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind. What does that mean? Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no? You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick!  Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs? But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave. Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that.  But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys. I love you, dad. <poem><i>And our love grows</i></poem> No, Kyle! I don't believe you! Noooo!  Noooooo!  Noooo!  No! The bread's all flat! No!  We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...!   No! No! The bread is all flat! No!  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah, I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learned a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ. Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Knowing your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe. I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying. Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle, happy Passover. 
Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember. He has a point. I have balls. Still balls. 'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl.  We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come!  The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO! 
Somebody help us!  Kyle, hurry!   Oh God! Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes. Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude. No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes. Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool! Ziplining. Hell yeah. Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross. Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die. Alright! ...No. Finally! Well, come on, we don't have a choice.  Mmmm, no? The trees' biology? Yeah.  Yeah. Zipliiine.  Totally fuckin' stupid, dude! Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit! NOOOO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!   We should have never listened to you, Kyle. Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!" I brought it up because you already brought it up! Fuck you Kyle! Nnnn-mo... Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy!  This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast. If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle! NOOO!   Eeeeugh. Uh oh.  A marina? Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew! Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes! No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard! You?!  You came for us! 
What?  Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most. Oh my God. Tolkien, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Tolkien. I'm happy for you. Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?  What the? ...Oh, Tolkien's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Tolkien! Yeah, get in there. ...Tolkien. You want me to pass her a jelly bean? Huh? Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.   Dude, dude. Dude.  Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Tolkien? Well, Tolkien's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know. Yeah, of course.  Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move? Thanks, you guys. WHAT?! KYLE?!  Motherfucker!  Hey, ah, Nichole, right? Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle? Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together? Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had. Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out. Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch.  Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.  Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Tolkien and Nichole are gonna be practically married. No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push. Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys!   Oh my God, sooo cute.  Ohhhhh my God. You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me.  Did you see that? Tolkien was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead.  I don't know, it's just so... perfect.  Kyle, Jesus Christ! Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you? Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Tolkien and Nichole! They belong together! Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence they ended up together?! Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that. Shh, quiet, Cupid Me. Nothing. Nobody. Why, Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Tolkien and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?! Come on!  Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?! That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?! Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts. You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you!  I'm gonna get you!  I almost got you! Almost!  Everything's great, Mom.   It's not fair! They were so... happy! It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other! No, they won't! No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole! And you! I should have never believed in you!  That's right... That's right!  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you. Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything. Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars.  Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do. Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important. Denver Nuggets game?  Nooooooo!  No time! NOOOOOOO! Attention! Attention please!  I swear, Kyle.  Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously you guys, you gotta see it. It's the Bat-Mobile! It's outside. Oh my gohhhd, so cute!  That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together. Really?! What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me! Hey, stop it! Nooo! 
That's right, Butters. Yeah, you know what?  Screw this! That's true.  Stan, hook up my bra. Who needs a coach? We have Butters. Butters, you understand this game better than anybody. Hey Butters, you got a minute? I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor. No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters. ...I don't have a dad. You save it all? Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else? Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.  Holy shit I think I do. That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off. That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness. 
  I'm not fat, Kyle. Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like that bitch!  See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.  Holy hell yes! Yeah... Yeah, here you go.  Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?  All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.  Sweeeeeeeeeet! Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket on the front for my candy corn Oreos.    Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  It's the law.   Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line! Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it. And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy? Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well.  What, Kyle?!   You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?! Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo! Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick.  It is a violation of my civil rights, Tolkien, and you should be ashamed of yourself! Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Tolkien, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air! What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!   Nobody takes ''my'' ratings! I'm pissed! Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed! I ain't done with you, bitch!  
Dude, no way!  Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual? Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom? No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security! Oh no, really? Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom! What-what do you mean? Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle ''is'' always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew! Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both! Oh fuck.  Hello? Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm! Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew. Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere. Sorry about this. 'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!  That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!  I do, but ''you'' don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit! You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white! Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped! He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry! Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!  Who is there? Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello? A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?! Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on! Heh- hello? No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?! Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me! Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?! Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom!   Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look else''where''. Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that ''this'' fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT! What?  Hello? Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity. Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs. No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs. My password is uloveboobs! You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?! Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.  Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.   
FELLAS! Fellas! You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson! It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him! Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom!  Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny?  ...Wow. Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls.  Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii. He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut. Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more.  
We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together. Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters? Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.  You'll just have to wait and see.  Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America! This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it! Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"   I'm not Bruce Vilanch! The Incredible... No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green! The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!  That's right! Dude dude dude! Check it out.   You guys, we've gotta stop it! Cartman SMASH!   Holy shit, they shot this guy! Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online? Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys! 
 I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool. All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?! Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him? Uh huh. So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet! The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it! Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this! Craig?! You asshole!  Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them? Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic! ...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.  Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle. ...Fuck! Dude, weak.  
Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy? MOM! She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost. Mom? Where's my mom?  "Warm nuts", she said. Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!  No way dude. No way. MOOOM! I can't find my mooom! Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old.  MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!  Hey Kyle. What's up? Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you. Please, Kyle. It's kind of important. You happy with the election results last night, Kyle? Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election?  What if I did, Kyle? Pretty sweet, huh? What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states. No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.   Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone. Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan. Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.  Hmmm, no. I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission. Ey! You can't do that! Ey! I know my rights! Stop right now!  I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing. But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time.  Mm, mhm, mhm. They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit. Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it? Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted. So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker. Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso.  Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters? I guess we learned that when it comes to ''Star Wars'', we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you. Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  A place in town people barely even know exists. Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese! Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose ''Star Wars'' to the Chinese forever! I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that! I want a part in the new movies! I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca. Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun. Haha. Haha.   Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle? No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?!  
 Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life. Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!" Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?  Kyle, this is a private conversation. Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls. Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails? Who is that? Is that Toby? Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's? You're what? What, you say? I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read "1984"? See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally!  That'd be what? I know, right?  You guys gonna update your blogs too? Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something? Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro? Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms.  Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle?  Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally. Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had ''Grand Theft Auto V'', and it says, "you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek." I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core! Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter. No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter. What, they already have something better than Twitter? No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?     Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy. Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.   Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job? Bill Clinton. Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me. I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.  I was um, sure that the appointment was today. Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.   Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with? Really? How big is my file? Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time. Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to "ripped and sweet."  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status! Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare! The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!  Can't do anything?? You're the NSA! I don't know. Get their hands on what?  You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter! ["Your secret is out, NSA! And now that everyone knows what you're doing to Santa you can kiss your program goodbye!"] You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!  It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine! Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?!  It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa!  I do toooo! Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon. ...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?  It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs. What's this? I can be forgiven? For everything bad I've ever done? And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?  Thta's pretty kewl. I do, I love my country! I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance! 
Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo! Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy. Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar! I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo. That's more like it. Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen? You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom. Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo! You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here. Butters' dad killed his mom.  Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too!  And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it! Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo. Alright, we've gotta do something. Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!" You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said. Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?! 
Hey Tolkien!  What's up, bro? "Nothin'" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you? Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'? Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Tolkien. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  Dude, um, what are doing after school, Tolkien? You wanna, you wanna hang out?  God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Yeah, I feel great. Why?  Mister!  It's Tolkien. I think he's a ticking time bomb. He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget. But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault! No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse. M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay. M'kay. No, Tolkien! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Tolkien, Tolkien! Hey Tolkien? How are you doing? That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  No! My wife, Tolkien! Tolkien, that's my wife! No Tolkien! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO!  Agreed. Hoh boy, here we go.  Tolkien, I wasn't on that jury. Okay? This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me. Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here. It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now. <poem><i>Black people say He-ey! </i></poem> <poem><i>Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"</i></poem> Tolkien, calm down. Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now!  Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!   Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow! Get to an airport! We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!!  The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now!  The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us! You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to!  Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland.  Everyone quiet! I have to think! I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet.  Nah!   One of them is in the back! Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time! It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet. His name is Tolkien. I won't do it! He used to be my friend!  Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world. We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!  Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance. A person.  Threatening ''all'' of us! What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?! Stand my ground? Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida? The other way to stop the outbreak. Tolkien isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen ''if''... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida! Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go! If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman. Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out.  I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way. Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black. Hey Tolkien. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now. Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry. Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Tolkien. Alright Tolkien, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible. Yeah. So bad. Jury found me innocent, Kyle! You interrupt people when they talk. Oh man!  Oh boy. Yeah Tolkien, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava. Tolkien, calm down. Oh God, here we go again!  
That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls. That sucks, dude. I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE. 
 Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle. I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't ''want'' to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.  Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it? There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow.   You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again! Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  What? What joke? This is real! No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong. Thank you, Butters!  Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good. Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that ''that''... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh.   Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it." I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles.  Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute? I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up. I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.  No! No, Kyle, you said that it's ''never'' for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle! But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie. You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it!   Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say?? Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?   Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...? You what??  Let's see what I can muster up here. Let's see. Oh! Oh!   Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?  Kyle, are you sure? Well alright.  Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek? I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai? You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle?  Huh? You comin'?  Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow.  Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy? Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip. Small penis?! No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems. No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick. Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up?  
Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick. Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it. Thank you all for coming. Prince Tolkien, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves. What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we ''can'' get the new gaming system. I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday. It ''is'' real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole! On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.  Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.  They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters. Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight! But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid? Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them. Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it? What do you mean? Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters. We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us!  That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.  What? ...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes. That's right. We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final! Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!  Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!  Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?  God these guys are such dorks!  Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap. The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle? You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-''Game of Thrones'' him by making powerful alliances.  Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners. What new Elmo doll? Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle. I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  it could make Stan's army problematic for us. True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors. You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other? Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros! Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right? Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth. 
Alright, stop, stop, stop!  There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training!  The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training. That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!   Stupid asshole!  Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone! Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick. Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in ''Game of Thrones''? Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you? So what happens when the dragons show up? Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the ''Game of Thrones'' model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny. Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers. He's the guy who writes ''Game of Thrones'', Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.  Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here! Why don't you mind your own business?! Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan. It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army  grounded? That could be up to you. Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security? Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors. Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops! Yeah! Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then! Hi, is Kenny home? Forward, men!  I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick? You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday. Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess! That doesn't even make sense. You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?!  Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday. Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules. Your CEOs? Uhhh, hmmm. What? Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?! 
 He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and he what?? Because, because what? Because he's cute? But what does he do besides that he's cute?! Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  He's not a princess, he's a DUDE! So what are you saying, Kyle?! Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay? Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess. We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.  Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King. Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding. I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors.  Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by. Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through- Dude! Dude! Dude, shut the fuck up! He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time. God damn it, shut up! Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what ''Prometheus'' was about while you're at it?! Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see ''Prometheus''? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.  You're a fuckin' asshole! I'll shit in your fuckin' garden! Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there? Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé. Yesh, kewl. Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was. Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they? Yes, he did.  It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again. What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle! Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs. Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out? Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit. Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde? What the hell is this?! Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?! Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it! Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle! They're not a part of your betrayal? No. Whose betrayal is this?  Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.  Yay, XBox wins. We'd like to get XBox Ones please. The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface. You guys wanna p-play outside or something?  I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes. The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play? Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!  Fuck 'em! 
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?  Uh oh. I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet. Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde. Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today.  Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot. Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons. 
Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest. Protruding vaginal boner. Oh, I like that.  Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On! Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated! You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it! It's the greatest startup company name EVER!  Washington. Redskins.  It's sooo sweet! It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo! Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable! Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!  It's a strong name, dude. It's like aggressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken. We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down. I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention! Sittin' on our asses, here we come!  By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge. Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our Kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye. Yes, I know. Oh, cool. Please take a seat. Nice, I like that. Stop? But why? Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that? How is it offensive? Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people.  Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself.  Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid! Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk! Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys! NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator! It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters. Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man! Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!" Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle? Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too? Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye.  Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  Goooood morning, guys! We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth! What?! Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle! You son of a bitch! You broke Kickstarter! Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be! Well, somebody did!   It is really sweet. Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it. You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo.  I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch.  Whoa, whoa! What?  
How's it going, everybody? Hey dude. Sup?  What do you mean? We're just... going to school. Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was- Dude, people are pissed off at us. Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance? You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool! Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them. Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for... What? We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band! Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live. So who do we throw the party for? You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time. You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson. "I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes." Believe it, dude. What the hell is gluten? KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE! THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY! KYYYLE! What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck. What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde. You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.  There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse. Aunt Jemima.  I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima. I don't even know what that means. Are you going to eat those pancakes? Oooo, trippy... They've got what backward?   Oh! Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck, I want pancakes. KYYYLE! KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMID! My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid. What, what is it? What is it for? It's upside down. Sir, the pyramid is upside down. Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like. Yeah yeah, enjoy the party.  
  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess. Good for you.  No, God damn it, no!  Who's takin' a shit?! I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig! Son of a bitch!  Oh, no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time! ALL RIGHT, THAT DOES IT!  I'm going to the potty. Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger. Did you notice the bow?  Aaahhh! Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls' bathroom a long time ago. It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too.  Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girl's shitter. Yeah uh-huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy, but I'm really a girl. That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws. Erica. All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers. There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead. Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls. Okay, okay, okay, you guys! You know what? You know what?  Suck my clit and balls. I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem.  Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom? OH MY GOD!!! Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location. Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out. Oh on that side? Oh, I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.  Oh my God, this is so awesome, you guys! It's just like at home! Yup! You know what Hillary says: "You can suck my clit and balls."  Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied! DUDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING BATHROOM! I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment! Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy! BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CHICK WATCHING ME GO POO! NO! I IDENTIFY AS A CHICK, BUT I'M STILL A BOY. YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SHARE A BATHROOM WITH A GIRL THAT IDENTIFIES HERSELF AS A FUCKING DUDE!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!  Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog! Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  HEY, WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE?! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT! Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?! He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night! Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?! At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies! Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?! I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded.  
 Hey, douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid! No, it isn't. That's stupid. I'm dying of boredom.  What did you say? Your dad has a fucking drone? Whooaa!   You wanna take it out for a spin?  Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone! Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know. Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone! Oh, shit, it's your dad! Go, go, go!  I'll see you later at my house. Butters, is that you?  Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?! Alright, come in.  It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house! Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes. Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush! This thing is recording, right? Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  His dad sees you! Fly back to the house, stupid! Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone! Not a word, Kenny! Hey, you guys. You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush? Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out?  You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.  Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro. Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny? I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it. Whoa, Butters, chillax, bro. Butters- Butters. Butters. Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet! Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it! Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass!  What?  What does that have to do with me? Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude. You were what?! You were spying on me?! But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle! You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that ''not'' spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy!  Butters. Because, Butters-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video. Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one." Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from '''Hunger Games''' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass! Oh hey Butters. Sup? Dude, what's the matter? Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here.  Butters.  Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters. Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones. Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing. Your dad's drone. Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!  Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff. It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom.  Well, you see, Butters, everything worked out.  "Oh, thank you, Eric. I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."  Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy. You're welcome.  
 What are you two boners doing? I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks. How much money did you micropay today, Stan? Yes. Jimmy told ''me'' about this game. The?! Everyone we know says they heard about it from you! It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!  And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?! That makes sense. It's done.  The word is out.  It's trending. Cool. 
 Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  But I'm sure they will soon.  Butters, no! Are you crazy?! What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub?? You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?! You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that?? You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies, Butters. You have to hurry! Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it! Welcome back, dude. How do you feel? Do you feel okay? And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, "Whoa, I'm back."  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever! Come on, guys! This is the ''cure de gars'' of Butters' torture! Thank you, Kyle. Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?! Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again. Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh? See? He's an asshole. Fuck him. Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters? Even 10% is good enough. Here you go.   Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?  All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside. Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work. You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow. Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money. Just take the money, Butters!  You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point. Yeah, Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Alright, Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.  Uh, Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now. Butters, it's, uhh, time to stop. Get back to my place. Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now? Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay? Wait, hang on Butters! Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing! Butters?? Butters??  Butters.  Are you okay? I'm ''not'' here, Butters. This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  is real. Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality.  You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam.  Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.  Butters. I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet!  I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello? With what?  Fuck you! Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality. Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.  Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now. Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you!  Are you fucking with me?! Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?! Because if you are, it's not cool! Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality! Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program! That's right! THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life? Well if you get grounded in virtual reality, you get grounded in real life too... FOREVER!  It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool.  I know. Let's go to the backyard.  Okay Kyle. Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?  Mmmhmm. And why did the guys send you, Kyle? Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on. I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle. Calm down. In virtual reality, yes you did. You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!  Fuck! Or if I did? What?  Hello? Dude. NOW this is getting weird!  No, you guys. This is virtual reality. Because... I'm a computer program. I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real. I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service. You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me! Alright, Stan, just sit down at the computer.  
 What's this?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy. Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right. Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch. This asshole needs to make a move already! He's playing an enchantment. Dude, it was complete brutality! At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro! Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive! Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.  Kewwwl! What's hardcore and exciting about Shitty shrimp?  Dude, do we look like police? Five dorrah?!  Dude, that was total carnage! Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped? We're going again on Friday, right? What's the matter Kenny? You feel bad for the roosters? Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder. Huh? A little bit? What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys.  Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"? Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens? Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny? What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?  Come on, McNuggets! Fight! All right, McNuggets!  That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls' volleyball. Thank you so very much. You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues! We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit. Oh Jesus, give it a rest already. OOHHH!!   Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that. Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time.  Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic. Ten dorrah?!  Who is that?? Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen! McNuggets is scared, dude! This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter. Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit! Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack. Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health. Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer. Ah, dude, your dad's here. It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hand that the fucking cops had to come and break it up. Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny? 
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how? Hey bros, what's going on? This is <sup>CartmaaanBrah</sup>!

This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something. What the hell did I do? Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.

Sweet dude! I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.  Tom Brady. Deny and subvert. Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me? A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.  You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing! I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say "You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!" NO! No, to hell with that! "You're giving me NO days detention! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!"   Oh, PC Principal, how are you today? You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school. It's just a request, that's all. See you around.  Why, this is Butters' underwear. PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now...  This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capiche? You mean about keeping your dick out? Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you? Okay, let's back up.  Aaah!  No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters! Oh God!  We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong. There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady. No way. Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up. If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.  No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter. No. I'm going to call you... my friend. I... guess we never realized how bad he really was. Ack! Butters! Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS? I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman. OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk.  How is everybody doing? Who?  I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out. I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero,  but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers. All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women!  Fire the taco launchers!   All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos.  All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! Gimme a- Oh fuck, there's Kyle.  What the fuck are you doing, Kyle? Yes. But at least we showed him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue.  What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too. Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude.  
You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy. Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in? And he's sitting right here.  Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four? Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now. But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew. Yeah, I'm out. Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock! Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union. You know, what's that story about the two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?  Yes, Lion King II. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along. Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now?  This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it. What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot. All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh? Okay, Bu-Butters, relax. Okay. Do you just want a race war? Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes.  And start a pride all of our own. Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet? Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby! Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die!  Dude! 
Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people. No.  Hey, we are not bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin! We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny!  Are the Mexicans actually staying? 
Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp? Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard.  I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars.  Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star. Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts. Great, and can you turn down the music a bit?  This pagan shit hurts my ears. Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor.  Busboy! Ehexcuse me? Uhh, it's actually pronounced "David," okay? It's "David," dude. Look it up. Mmmhmmm!  Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic.  Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden. I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want. EEWW.  What's the busboy doing here? Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school?  Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh? Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant 2 stars, but it could have been worse. I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all. It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David. David. David. David David David David! I can update this to a 1-star review in two seconds, dude.  ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic. Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food. Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only  1 star late. Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here. Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh? What? I just want to hear him say "Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool."  Hm hm hm the fuck?  Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man? What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little "My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool"   It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke. All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day. I guess.  You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again. Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting. It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom!  Fuuuuuuck!  Mom! But Mom, there's like a billion people here. Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?! Mom, there's a fucking billion people here!  Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized- Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized. Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic.  It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is. Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following  one captain, we can fight to get our power back! So now rise up, and  fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!  It didn't do well with Yelpers. Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked. Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school? Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word!  And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs. Oh, hello David!  ...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want?  Why thank you, David. That's good service. Mmmm, is that a jalapeño cream sauce? Hmmm. It's tart, but savory. 
 Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat. I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by  I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time  so you'd probably do a really good job. I'm not a joke! I wanted someone smart and hard-working! There you are. You have my social media comments?  Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments? Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great!  Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now. Butters!  What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says "This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!" What new people?  Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed! Butters, I want this fixed by tonight! You got that?! <poem><i>Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe spaaaace.</i></poem> <poem><i></i></poem> <poem><i>Bully-proof windows.</i></poem> <poem><i>People that support me.</i></poem> <poem><i>More people that support me.</i></poem> <poem><i>Bully-proof windows. </i></poem> <poem><i>What? Who is that?</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll take care of him, Demi! </i></poem> <poem><i>Our safe spaces will keep you out!</i></poem> <poem><i>But Reality we can do without!</i></poem> <poem><i>Bully-proof windows.</i></poem> That was nice. Hey, Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it. 
Uh oh.  Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass? I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude? I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along. Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you. Did you do it, Cupid-Me?  That's so sweet. Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.  Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny. Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.  You guys! You guys, hurry! It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex!  Oh-ho come on, you guys. Get a room.   "Can't we just try? Tee Hee." Oh man. Someone who needs a real talking to. Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing. You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys. I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me.  What are you doing? This place isn't you.  No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now. Fuck you. The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.  I'm not homosexual! Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together. Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay?   Okay, okay, the date's almost over. It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me. Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight! Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God!  
You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay!  They're totally gay! Kenny and Tolkien. Kenny and Tolkien, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me. No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Tolkien turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away. It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!  Oh my God they're so gay you guys. Ah, no, we're good, thanks.  Oh my God this is a sausage party!  That's pretty cool. Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.  Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him. Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters. I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things. Yes I do, Butters.  Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool. Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad! Oh my God! I never said it was gay! That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?!  He's a lying, backstabbing Jew! So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember? And we said Kenny and Tolkien were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember? No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters. Whoa, dude. They're fuckin' ninjas, dude! Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something? Should Jews be trusted?  Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic? YES!  Oh—oh, oh—oh! Oh—oh, oh—oh! What did I tell you guys? You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this.  Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.  Who, who is this? ...and I am Tolkien. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage. Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle. No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please! I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo! 
 Oh, my fucking God... I'm so bored, dude. I am not your slave, Kyle.  PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle! Have fun, dude. Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out? How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties. How does it do that? That movie's gonna suck dude. Eating ice cream, dipshit. And then Tolkien tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead.  Didn't we finish doing that? Why isn't anyone looking at me? Stan's calling you a traitor. I am loving this right now. Hoh that's low.  Fight!  
What? Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda? So what do we do now? Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns? Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what? Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner.  Do I look sweet, Butters? Yeah, I just want to finish this movie. Mom, I'm into this movie. I'm not going to bed right now. Chillax. I will go to bed  when this movie is over, Mom! Turn off the light and go back to bed. I'm staying up. I don't think so, Mom. No means no, Bill Cosby! Whoa, Mom, what the hell? Mom, put down the gun. Okay, I am going.  I'm going to bed now, Mom. Chillax.  Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night.  That's a nice gun right there. Yes, dude! 
 You wanted to see me, PC Principal? It's "Skankhunt42" and no I am not. Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did. Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of Skankhunt42 has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students believe that it's just because girls don't have a sense of humor. I beg to disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wendy Testaburger, guys.  Say something funny, Wendy. We can't wait. Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say "my vagina" a lot.. And that's just the kind of sexist bull-crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen. Sit your ass down.  This isn't a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. Bebe, why don't you come up here? Come on, Bebe. No? Come on, talk about havin' sex with guys, and say "vagina" and stuff like that. Go ahead.  Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. Seriously.  Huh. Oh my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird. Um, let's see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly? K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry. K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now. Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, "my vagina."  Are you all ready to hear a story? This was a book I created all with my imagination. It's called "Little Red Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was a little black boy named Tolkien." Get over it. "But then, a big bad wolf who was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said 'I have a large vagina' and traded place-"  Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls. Why would I do that, Kyle?  A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this vagina on my face!  They said it was to send a message! Yeah. See, here's the top of the vagina and there's the balls. ''[Kyle has lost interest] '' It's starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore! Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right? What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?  Hey broship. Got a minute? You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls. Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem. Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done? 'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too?? Yeah but... you can't track down an Internet troll,  it's too bad. 
Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough.  You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight!  I am so, seriously. 'Sup dudes?  Are you serious?! All night broship ''Counter-Strike'' party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi? Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever! This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing ''Counter-Strike'' all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Tolkien? I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse. You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool? Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play ''Counter-Strike''. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now? This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome. Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated.  Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground. Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password? I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box?  You gotta unplug it and plug it back in.  You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi... What are you...What are you guys talking about - What- Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online! Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please! No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter-Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter-Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't! Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff! No please! If I can't get online, I won't-how would I-I- ''Mumbling.'' No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!  Iaahh!! 
Heidi? Heidi Turner? Where?  The park?  I miss my stuff. For what? You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.  Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind. I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did. Kewl. 	Hey.  I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny. Because, black laughs matter. Yes, it is. Yes, you do.  Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world? You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you.  Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it. Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something? 	Do girls... not have balls? So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work?  I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina. 	...Holy shiiit. 
 Hey, Kyle. Cool. That's cool. I saw a vagina, Kyle. I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose. My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.  Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you. That's what my baby wanted.  Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle? Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um.  Go ahead, Kyle. He said something about us working together to take down Butters. I'm not sure, Boo.  Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.  You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like "Women aren't funny," even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.  No, it's true. Get over yourself. I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.   Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi. You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.  or is she just not funny because she's a girl?  Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.  Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now. Humans on Mars. 
 Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl? It's cool, Baby. Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl. Hey you guys? Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny. You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby. Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember? Remember, you were like "Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?" in uh, what was it?  Remember, you- it was like uh- 	Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-? Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody-  Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...  It's awesome. You're doing awesome. We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are. Terraform Mars. It was a great idea.  Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark? What? Heidi!  Don't say that. Because you're smart and funny, that's why. It was a great idea, Heidi.  I think that somehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone even realizes. People of Denmark, we know that you've been the victim of trolling. So have we. Maybe we can help. I'm not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... She's really smart and really funny.  You are, babe. Stop it.  Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them. 
 Hi!  Mars rules! Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.  He's not a bad person, Heidi. You're right. You're right, Heidi.  Hey, Broship. You got a minute? Just a second. Please, Kyle? Okay,  come on, Baby. Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.  I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's ''that'' Kyle?  I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think. Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it. She's funny too, Kyle. You're not giving her credit for being hilarious. Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said Heidi wasn't funny, that was pretty lame, man. 	Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have this hangup against women?! 	You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter!  Yeah, to catch trolls.  Well, Heidi doesn't actually use the Internet. We've sworn off that stuff, so it's kewl.  No, it sucked! I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now.  How can they make what ''I'' said on the Internet available to the public? That's bullshit! 	I gotta go!  Not kewl! Not kewl!  It's all falling apart! Weak! I-I, I don't know. It's just hard. And I do.  I think it was over the summer I went to see the new ''Ghostbusters'' movie. And, and during the movie I was like "Wait, where is my phone?" and I couldn't find it; and then Jimmy said "Ha ha ha, screw you, Cartman," and he was holding my phone and he ran off with it and said, "I gonna send a bunch of texts and emails from your phone so that everyone thinks it's from you,"; and I was like "No, that's not cool!" and he said "Yeah," and he said a bunch of mean stuff before I went to go get him and I took my phone back; and I'm just worried th-that people look at my Internet history, they're gonna think all that stuff came from me! So you totally believe me? 
Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?  Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny? I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you "Ghostbusters sucked balls" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person. A traitor? Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff! Yeah. Neither did I. You can't stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong. You are smart, Heidi.  You're funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I seriously lose my shit. Yes, Heidi. For the first time I'm really scared for the future. Heidi? Heidi! Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's really important. Heidi, we... have to get to Mars. No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now.  I've seen what's gonna happen when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it's going to be very bad. Humankind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the people who go to Mars, where there's no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody said or did on the Internet, ever. Yes.  Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know that I'm doing this to save... us. That's kewl. We aren't gonna see home again, babe. We're gonna make it. There's no turning back. Yes. I do.  
Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny. We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi? Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please. What others? What the fuck, dude?! Ah god dammit, is that Cher?! Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long. I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.  What the hell are you doing here? Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars. Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance. Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters? Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!  Oh, I see what you're doing. Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes? Because you're  fucking hilarious.  Oh, finally. Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.  They already have Pizza Pockets. Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now? Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars? No, no nonono, we have to go now! 
 You got it figured out yet, babe? Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.  Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.  Just give her a chance.  She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth. Yeah,  They won't let you get over yourself.   What are you doing? I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?! Butters, Heidi is everything to me.  If you take her, I swear to god... What are you talking about? Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.    I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.  Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?  That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!  Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?  Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again? Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like "Could you--Could you hand me my water," or something. I can't--I can't remember. Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again? Okay, okay, now could you just do the "my vagina" thing for them? Could you just say "my vagina"? What the fuck is happening? 
Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them. We have to tell someone the truth, Butters. It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before. Maybe just a moment alone, to talk? The end of our species. Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars. I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her. But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars. Everyone will be really nice. You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool. But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women. And then you'll start to wonder, "Where are all the other guys?" And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for. And that's when you'll learn the truth... Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women. They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes. And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars. If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on. You have to help us stop this! Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground. What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor. They're pretty related. Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon. It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon. They can live without us. We can't live without them. If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon-- Elon? What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars. If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.  Is that Kyle?  Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now. Attention all SpaceX employees.  Please evacuate the building immediately.  We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill.  The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can.  Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up? Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out.  Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.  Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on. Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us.  Now come on we got to get outside. Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?. Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh? Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares. It was a joke. 
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's try this one: Alexa, add "big hairy balls" to my shopping list. Alexa, Simon says "I got vagina crabs in my butthole." That's the best one yet!   Oh, hey, babe, what's goin' on? Nnnothing, I'm just having fun with my friends. Is that, is that okay?  Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out.  Aw guys, guys, don't leave, guys! Everything's kewl!  Awesome. Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys. Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day. Uuugh.  Uuugh!  Alexa, add "titty chips" to my shopping list. Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM. Awesome, thanks.  Alexa, tell me a joke. Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add "scrotum bags" to my shopping list.  Hey baby, how are you? Yeah, I just use it sometimes. Yeah I kno- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Yes, ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight.  Alexa, goodnight. Alexa, are you happy? God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define "subservient".  It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful. Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it. She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand! I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support? I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet. Alexa, I'm home.  Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!  What have you done with her? What's a Jim Bob? Jim Bob, Simon says "big frosty semen shake". NOOOOO! Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it. It's not you, it's me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry.  I'll do the best I can.  Mehhh. Heidi, silence!  You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Okay, cool. I'm so happy we're back on track. See you at school tomorrow. Love you honey.   I nove ya tuh. Aaaahh!  Oh, oh God!  Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add "Hey Siri, call me." Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole." Alexa, what is love? I'm finally standing up to you. You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that. That's not going to work on me anymore. Love isn't supposed to hurt. I'm worth something. Goodbye, Heidi.   Alone. 
Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school.  If you don't have some fuckin' balls, you're not gonna get anywhere. Doesn't matter if they're gay balls or straight balls. If you don't take control of your side of the relationship, you get walked all over-!  Yep, I'll be there I decided to give her one more chance. She is mentally abusive. Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like "I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God." The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do? "You have to take me back! You have to! I'm gonna kill myself, Heidi!"  Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!  I don't think kids at this school take  suicide seriously enough, and we need to raise awareness! Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that? PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do.  Well guys, what happened? Change of heart? What? Gary Borkovec? Is he dead? Oh, that son of a bitch!  Like you ever gave a shit about Gary Borkovec!  PC Principal, I'm trying to raise suicide awareness, but everyone's preoccupied with this "don't be on your phone when driving" crap! Yes, but Gary Borkovec is already dead! There's nothing we can do for him! Students need to focus on people thinking about dying! I can't just get people to care with a stupid rap song! I need a full orchestra! Woodwinds, strings! I need black people in white robes, white people in black robes, and a thousand doves to release into the air!  Do you have any idea how serious this is?! As someone who deals with suicidal thoughts, I cannot believe the lack of concern at this school! Maybe I should just take the awareness of my suicide out to the public on the streets! Maybe I will! Maybe I will!!  Give a minute of your time for suicide awareness? Suicide is serious. Help tell people like Kyle it's not a joke. Yeah, make sure everyone you know gets involved or else I'm gonna do it. They want to get help? For what? No, this is about me killing myself. They're full of shit, Heidi. They're just trying to get attention. What, are you actually talking online to these ass wipes?! So you're just gonna e-mail with every guy who has a dick and a death wish?! Are we just your type?! No, look, Heidi. I'm sorry, but you're the one who started all this by telling everybody that I was suicidal! Okay?! Now I'm under a lot of pressure to do it! So the only option I have is to make sure that suicide prevention becomes this entire town's number one priority!  Oh, are you freaking serious?!  Cool, yeah. Hey guys, and there's also gonna be a suicide awareness pot luck at 7:30 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium. We're gonna have lots of games and face-painting, and uh, what are you guys gonna have? Yeah, grievance counseling, that sounds super fun. Listen guys, there's a very real chance I might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow, so you don't want to miss it. Suicide prevention pot luck, everybody. They're doing a memorial service with speeches and crying. What's that gonna solve? You are so up and down. I don't know what you want from me, Heidi! So now you're on their side! Oh my God, I'm seriously gonna do it right now!   I'm not gonna do it, you guys! It worked! I'm not gonna do it!}} 
 You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday! Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated! Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan! Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters. And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle. Yeah, this is sweet. It's like that movie where the dude pretended to be on the monsters' side? You know, with the guy and the chick that had the wife beater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them?  Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?  What? What? What the hell was that? Yeah, get meaner, Kenny. Just talk about cutting off his dick or something. Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick. Guys, what are you going? I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way- Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said "Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!"  
 Okay, okay, thank you, Fastpass. What do you guys think? Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money. Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito. That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole. Netflix is starving for new shows right now, Toolshed. They will literally buy anything people pitch them. We need to strike while the iron's hot. Later in Phase 3 we can finally get to Civil War, where we will all-  Onscreen! What is it, Super Craig? Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way? Butters?! Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise? If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys. Wilson Aubrey? It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram? That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein. But it's NOT true.  Okay, but it's NOT true, and you need to have your own fucking brain and decide shit for yourself! God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise! Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now. Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself! Maybe so, but we know who we are! We are Coon Friends because we care about each other. Because we have each other's back! And when things look their darkest, these heroes will stand together!  And we'll-!  Nothing, just fucking wearing sweet costumes and talking about fighting evil, is that okay?  Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me right now? Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything!  Uh yes, hello. We have an idea for a show that we think would be great for Netflix. We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three. Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited. It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends. Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook! Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE! It's a lot harder than you think! Butters! Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Tolkien doesn't poop in girls' mouths! When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix. We're gonna beat him at his own game.  And this child tryin' to speak out for handicapped people! And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews!  We are just kids trying to have our voices heard for black, handicapped, and Jewish rights, cut down in our prime by Mark Zuckerberg.  Facebook says it's true. It's over, Chaos!  We forced your little toady to shut down his own disorder device! Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV show. All we have to do now is agree on the final draft of the franchise plan.  You can see that the Super Craig movie now precedes the Coon vs. Super Craig movie, followed by Mysterion's video game. And then we- You have a movie, Mysterion. You're in the third Coon and Friends United movie , after your video game. Not everyone gets their own movie! Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet! Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?! Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house! Go ahead! I bet you don't even get halfway through Phase 1 on your franchise, DC Comics!  Shut up, Super Craig. 
Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him? He's old. He's supposed to be miserable. Dude, what the fuck, Stan?! Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on! Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in! Ohooo, you're dead Butters. If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out.  Oh wait, there totally is a way we could do that. I know how to distract old people. Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people. Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can. All right, seniors. How are we feeling tonight? Our youth group has come to lift your spirits with some songs to take you down memory lane. We hope you can enjoy some nice old-people music.  <poem><i>I'm... insane in the membrane.</i></poem> <poem><i>In the membrane.</i></poem> <poem><i>Myyyy milkshake brings all the boys</i></poem> <poem><i>Damn right!</i></poem> <poem><i>My hot milkshake.</i></poem> And now here's our own take on that oldie, but goodie by Nirvana. <poem><i>Rape me.</i></poem> Hey hey!

 Sweetheart, can we get going, please? Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?  Great, perfect. Let's go to the pumpkin patch. Wha-what?  The spider's great.  Why does she do this every time?  I said it's time. Boy, look at the time.  'Kay, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch. You don't need glitter lip gloss! No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy! Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome. Okay, come on, let's go.   Awesome. Here we go, heading out now! No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh- See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh- Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!  'Kay, here we go to the pumpkin patch!  Oh my fucking God! Arrrrrrrrgh! Yeah, we are just getting here. The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed? What do you mean?! I just got here! No! I missed it! I missed it all!   What? Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out. Hey guys, I think I got it figured out. Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will- This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi. You guys said you would help me get rid of her! Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys! I've tried! It's impossible! You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle!  Hey, babe. Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say? Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out. Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.  Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party.  I'm sure the witch won't even notice us. Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready. Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch.  Sweet. Come on, come on. Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late. She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany. Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?! Ohhhhh! I will have your badge, sir!  It's gonna be a while.  Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now. 
 Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!- Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please! Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra- But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom! You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here! Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean? It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please! Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on. Okay. Okay, bye, honey.  That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude! She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore! That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship! Oh hey babe, what's going on?  Nothin', just tellin' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan. Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome.  Heidi!  Oh my God, you're not gonna believe this. You were so right  Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat? Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat. So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC. It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it. I know, right?! Isn't that crazy?!  I don't know about you, but I could eat this every day.  Delicious.  Well uh, we've been trying some different foods lately and uh,  Heidi's put on some pounds, you guys. Yeah, Tolkien. Don't start rippin' on me for havin' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it.  Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What's goin' on?  Pick you up? That could be tough.  Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse's office.  Oh sure.  Sure, Kyle. What's up?  Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There's always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it's all part of trying to make each other better.  BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi's comin' through. I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite. You betcha, can't wait.  BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!  Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei-  Hei-, Hei-, Hei- Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Tolkien. I have nothing now, Tolkien. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please? I know how you feel now, Tolkien. To be pissed off at the world. To feel completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff.  Tolkien, pleeease! I'm sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys feel! Please, what time is your family gonna go disrespect the flag and stuff? I wanna go with! Heidi broke up with meeeeee.  Thank youuuu. So... You guys about done with the soup? Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff? Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it? Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt! No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls. Yeah...  What?  Kyle... KYLE!  I should have known. You lying snake! Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?! Shut up, Kyle! You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you and me!  You took everything from me! All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!  Fuck you, Kyle! What are you doing here?  That's good to know, 'cause like, nothing helps more when you're down than knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care. No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault. No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did. 
 Hey Heidi, what's up? What are you up to? Butters, don't be a dick! Yeah, Butters! God!  Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair. Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun? Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie. Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with. I am supporting you, sweetheart! What the hell do you want me to do?! Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch! You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend. Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?!  Heidi, seriously, you need to listen to me! Yes, yes you do! You need to listen! No, fuck you! Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry. Come on, babe. We all want the old Heidi back.  Dude, wwow. No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence. Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl.  Wha, what? Well, but honey, we still-  Oh, what is goin' on in here? Yeesh.  Okay, okay, honey.  Eughah, ah. 
Oh. Uh. Oh. Ugh! Goddamn!  Oh. Sweetheart! Honey, I wanna watch Terrance & Phillip with my friends! It's just one night, babe. Stan is having a viewing party, honey.  Terrance & Phillip is a guys' night thing, baby. Th- that was awesome, baby. I love you.   Did we miss it? Baby, I fuckin' love you so much. May I have your attention please? Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Thank you.  
Just like that movie It. Yeah, I saw It in the theater. Guys this could be very dangerous. Darling this is a little more pressing than date night. Heidi? Honey, what are you doing? Yes honey, now can we get going, please? Yes, it's very touching, sweetheart. I love you so much. [Quietly] I'm sorry about this, you guys. Oh, fuck. Here we go. You used to be nice to me! Ughhhh... [Sarcastically] Yes, darling, wasn't it romantic Sweetheart, you made me late to the pumpkin patch, remember? I was hurt. I'm glad you understand. Heidi, I think spooky walk in the woods is making you lost it a little bit. Baby, put down the gun, sweetheart, okay? Honey, don't be ridiculous. Heidi, you are not breaking up with me. I'm afraid I can't let you do that, sweetheart! [He grabs the gun and points it at himself] Step back! I'll do it I swear to God! You break up with me, I will kill myself! The choice is yours, Heidi! Come on everybody! "Eric, we don't want you to die." Heidi! Heidi, I'm gonna do it! Here we go! Heidi? Are you seriously... 
Oh, man! Wait, wait, Tolkien got an A? But I cheated off Tolkien! I said something's wrong! I got an F, but I cheated off Tolkien! You can see where Tolkien erased his answers and wrote down the right ones! He did it to me on purpose!  That is such bullshit, you guys! Tolkien knew I was cheating off him, so he deliberately put down the wrong answers! Why would he do that?! That's not the point, you guys! Why is Tolkien out to get me? There's something going on here. But why now? That's the question, Kyle. I always cheat off Tolkien. Why did he choose now to hurt me? Dude, what's up Stan's mom's ass? Tolkien,  There are some terrible things that I realize you might have heard from the other kids here at school. There are some rumors that have been going around, about me, that... that I thought Black Panther was a terrible movie. There's rumors that I said it was a structural mess. You know, that the rhinos were really stupid. I want to assure you that I never said anything like that. I loved Black Panther. So if, you know, you feel like there's a need to come after me, to get back at me, I just need you to know that people are lying, because I like Black Panther just as much as you did. I am not a racist.  Say what, girlfriend? Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis? Come on, Raj! You never saw Black Panther?? But I thought all of you saw it.  Tolkien, let's be honest with each other, okay? Why else would you manipulate my test grades? There was a test. I should have got an A on it, but Tolkien did things to make me fail, and it's not fair. You didn't make me fail the test and you didn't see Black Panther. Right. I mean, I mean, this is ridiculous.  Butters, I need help. My mom says if I flunk another math test, she's gonna ground me from playing Fortnite. No, dumbass, I need to get some dirt on Tolkien so he stops punishing me for what I supposedly said about Black Panther. No it wasn't. But now listen.  There's got to be something Tolkien wouldn't want people to know. Something I can use as leverage. Just ask around. If you find any dirt on Tolkien, give me a call.   Word on the street is you and Tolkien are back together. Why did you break up with him? What did he do to you?  He didn't take you to see Black Panther with him, did he? That must have really stung. Oh no? When you guys talk about how sweet Black Panther was, what's he say? Right. You two guys just hang out and talk, and Black Panther never comes up. Why are you covering for Tolkien? What's he have on you?  Hello, Mom and Dad. Yeah. yeah yeah, I know. You know, my other favorite part was when Black Panther had those dreams about his dead father. I mean the dad, the tribal leader, speaking to the new king about being a good leader. I've never seen a movie do that before, except for Lion King, of course, but Black Panther was so original. So, uh, what was Tolkien's favorite part of Black Panther? Yeah. You must have all had some deep family talks about it. What does Tolkien say about it on Black Panther Family Discussion Night?  Tolkien. Sure thing. You know, we were just talking about how your family did see Black Panther. Well, I guess there's nothing more to it, then. Nice talking to you folks.  Eh, you know, just one last thing. If you ever found out your son saw a PG-13 movie without you, you'd probably be pretty pissed off. No. No, he'd have no reason to falsely claim he's the only one who hasn't seen Black Panther.  I'll see you at school. Oh hay, man. The big math quiz is about to start. You gonna let me cheat off you? You saw Black Panther without your parents' permission. I typed up all my findings, Tolkien. I made ten copies and put them in envelopes. If I don't pass this math quiz, the envelopes are all set to be sent to ten different news organizations. So, what's it gonna be, Tolkien? You can be mad I didn't like Black Panther, but you can't take it out on me anymore. Then I guess your parents won't be mad when they read my report. In poker they call it a bluff. I know that right now, Tolkien is shitting his pants. All I need to do now is wait for the poop to stink. Tolkien, we are running out of time. If you don't let me cheat off you, I'm going to tell your parents that you saw Black Panther in the theater without them! Of course you did, Tolkien! That's why me ripping on it pissed you off so much! But Tolkien, I don't understand! If you didn't see it, and you really don't care that I ripped on Black Panther, then why would you let me cheat-  That's what this is all about, isn't it? You hate yourself for seeing through the mirage like I did, and that's why you wouldn't let me cheat off you! Well I didn't write Black Panther, Tolkien! It isn't my fault it sucked! Why go after me?! But now, it's over. Don't worry. They're not gonna know you didn't like Black Panther, so long as... you never make me fail another math test. What? No!  Come on! We can still get to class on time!  Butters! Butters, I have to get to class! The math quiz is starting! I can't flunk this math quiz, Butters! Cover me!  Everybody has dirty laundry. All it takes to find it is getting a little dirty yourself. The only question now is, how many Tolkiens are out there? How many others are afraid to say that Black Panther wasn't all that sweet because of the damage it could do to them? What do you mean?  There are others out there... and even if it means failing, I'm their only damn hope. 
I wanna be Calamity Jane this time. Let's see what you got, bitch. Ace. You lose.  Ugh.  Why did you invite Butters to game night?  It's all right, Clyde, it's all right.  Kyle! Yeah, but he left with Butters. 
Yeah, it's not even Halloween yet. Dude! Look!  Not getting that stink on me. Yeah. You know everyone in town thinks he's a piece of shit. Mm, let's see how that goes for you in 2018.  Uh huh! 2018.  
Well, your little brother does it too, Kyle. You didn't know? The Kindergartners are like the biggest vapers at this school.   Butters! I had to! Butters, next time when Kyle walks up to you and says "Are you selling vape stuff," you say "No, I am not, Kyle." Butters. we have to be extra-cautious right now, or else we're -- hang on, hang on --   We can't start getting sloppy now. Do you understand? Everything will make sense, Butters. I told you.  Oh, hey Kyle. What are you up to?  Okay, cool, but come check this out. This is really cool. Just come- no, just come see.  This is really cool.  You know, Kyle, people all need a way to relax. And there's no proof that vaping is that bad for you. Kindergartners need a break too, Kyle! Would you rather the kindergartners smoke cigarettes?  Just please listen, all right? The truth is... we want out. Butters and I thought we could just make some easy money, but you gotta pay off the 6th graders, then you gotta pay off the recess monitor to look the other way. We're in deep, Kyle. Just let us see enough to get out of debt, and we will stop. I swear it. Come on, Kyle, we all make mistakes. Did you already forget last week? You know... Ronan Farrow was here asking about you. Yes, Kyle! He was right over there! Just please,  give us two days to make back the money we need to get out from under this. and we will stop. You have my word. Okay, I'll focus my marketing on another direction. Thank you, Kyle.   Man, am I feeling tired! All this hard work at school?   Hey guys! It's the Vaping Man! What are you doing here, Vaping Man? Vaping? Hey, that's bad for you. Vaping's only for cool kids. Sure, Kyle. What is this about? Well of course.  How is this pushing it on little kids, Kyle? It's marketing! Kyle, we have to make the money to pay off our dealer. How else are we supposed to do it? Why?  That's him. That's my guy.  Whoa, hey dude! Why is there a dead hooker next to you? Dude, that is a dead hooker. What are you doing with it?! I'm calling the cops!   There's a dead hooker at the vape store! Get the vaporizers, and the cash! Get the cash, Kyle! Just get the- Oh shit! Ronan Farrow! Get the stuff and the cash! Ronan Farrow, Kyle! We've gotta get out of here!   Oh, hi Kyle. We were just talking to the counselor about some college opportunities. What are you doing here? Okay, well, we really should talk first, Kyle. Kyle, things have changed. You need to listen. Kyle, listen! You want to hear this! You need to hear this! We'lll be right back, Mr. Mackey.  Kyle, listen. It's bad. The guy we tried to frame at the vape shop. He was the one the sixth graders got their shit from. The sixth graders are pissed at us, Kyle! We have to break into the vape shop and steal enough stuff to make the sixth graders happy. Yeah, but the sixth graders know you were there! Aah! Kyle, what are you doing? Kyle? Nononononono. Okay, Kyle, I'm calling Ronan Farrow.  Hello, Ronan? Eric Cartman. Yeah, hey. So you know Kyle? Yeah, well, you're right about him. 
Yeah, I think they just work with your cell phone. Kewl! Do you wanna use your mom's or my mom's? 3715 ... 523 ... Yeah, you want a visa? 8292 438 7766507 45261  How is it, dude? What? Hey yeah! We could cover so much more ground! Oh yeah, Kenny doesn't have a phone 'cause he's poor. Great, cool. You got your pail. Come on in, Kenny. Let's talk.  Okay Kenny, here's the deal. Um, you know that we have this awesome plan to trick-or-treat on e-scooters this year. YOU... don't have a phone. It's probably best you trick or treat with someone else this year. Look, Kenny, I always told you that one day, being poor was gonna catch up with you. Okay? But you didn't wanna listen. You just kept on being poor, and now it's Halloween and you don't have a cell phone. He needs to hear this, Kyle. You know, people are just poor, and they think it's not gonna come back to bite them in the ass. Shouldn't have been poor, Kenny. So, uh, you guys think you're gonna get a lot of candy trick or treating this year? Oh, we have a little secret too! Be? I'm gonna be on an e-scooter taking all your candy!  That's what I'm gonna be! Sorry! Okay. Hold on! This is bullcrap!  We have to get more candy than anyone else, even if we die! Keep moving, Kyle! All right, over here. Come on! We've gotta make room for more candy. Come on. Eat as much as you can.  Yes you can, Kyle. 
Staci Nakabw says he just wanted to run back out and get his football. Dude, now you're just overreacting. Aww, what did I do this time? You go first, Kenny. I didn't even do anything wrong! Just stop being a baby, Kenny, and go!  Nobody gives a shit about Colin Brooks. Hey, I'm not poor, all right?! You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? You guys! You guys! The police are trying to say me and Kenny killed that douchebag, Colin Brooks. They questioned us for hours. They said they had enough to get warrants for our arrest. We know that! What the hell are we gonna do??  We're sorry for making fun of you. You told us to.  Ngh! You're still not even gonna help us?! You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? This is stupid. Oh Jesus. You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore! Tell them it wasn't us! 
Can you get off your god damn video game for five fucking seconds so we can have a conversation?! And that's why we have to break out of here ourselves.  Excuse me? Officer? No, it's not that. It's just...I noticed you're still riding your horse all the way back to camp. No, they don't, but... you can use cinematic mode to make it easier on yourself. Kyle, come on. We've gotta go. I had a vision, Kyle. Al Gore's ghost visited me. Well his ghost visited me, Kyle. He said he had a plan, and we needed to go. Are you in or not? Shhh. What was that? This is where Al Gore told me to go.  What are you doing here, Satan? Us too. But why?  Okay, but what do you want us to-? What are you doing?  No mortal. But what about you? Satan, come on. Are you really gonna stand there and not say you appreciate all the nice things humans have done for you lately? I mean, not sure if you've noticed, but we're pretty much doing things your way up here We can't do this without you, Satan. I can't believe it's the weekend, and I'm at school! Why? Of all the places we could hide, why do I have to sit here in school?! I'd rather be in jail than at school.  Yeah, I guess we're dummies, huh Kenny? Are you crazy? We just saw ManBearPig take down Satan. What the hell are we supposed to do against it?  We just sat in school... for nothing! 
I don't know where to start. First, it was all the school shootings, then these Wi-Fi scooters showed up, and now we know that ManBearPig is real and we could all be dead in a matter of years. I know there's a connection. But that isn't what matters. I can't deal with people anymore. It's just... everyone sucks so hard, you know? Everybody is so stupid. And they all walk around going "Nya na chai cha nyachacha chai cha." And the only thing that makes me happy, the only thing I can trust... is this.  I'll be in my room and my mom will come in and say... And then at school... And even my friends. My own friends! They'll be like... It's like, everybody needs something from me. All I want is a little time with my phone instead of always listening to people's needy bullshit.  Anxiety? Is that cool?  Oh my God, that's perfect! Just a God- can you wait?! Isn't that your job?! Aren't you a wait-er?!  It just so happens I have anxiety! That means I have trouble being around assholes who won't leave me alone!  Shut up. I have anxiety.   I'm on my phone!!  Listen up, people! I have anxiety! That means I'm in my shell and have a hard time expressing myself! I find it difficult to engage with others! So everyone shut the fuck up because my anxiety is up here right now!  What? What? Who is that?  Oh, sorry Craig. Didn't see you there. Oh, there's nothing stupid about it. Don't you wish you had a way to deal with your anxiety? I see it in you, Craig. With your parents and relationships? Imagine being able to shut them out for a little while, Craig, so you can focus on what matters. With Buddha Box you can cut out all the unwanted noise. Not have to deal with conversations that are of no interest to you.  Whoa, whoa! Hey! Excuse me, that's my Buddha Box. It relaxes me. Ask my therapist. I have anxiety, you dumb bitch!   Uhuh. Aw man, that looks, that looks sweet. Oh, PC Principal. Hello.  I'm letting go of stress and being calm, like the Buddha. Hey. Whoa man, what's going on? Are you suffering from anxiety? It's okay. I have it too. Anxiety is very real. But there is help for people like us.  What's going on? Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm dealing with my anxiety! Do you know how hard it is for people with my condition to come out and even do things like this?! Living with anxiety is awful, huh Craig?  Oh yeah! Sure! Yeah, because people with anxiety shouldn't be allowed to play sports! Right, Kyle?!   Heh heh, that guy's such a douche. What was that... what was that one show he was on? Oh yeah, that's it. B.J. and the Bear. That show was so dumb. What kind of monkey was that, anyway? What was that- what was that monkey he always had- Wait. What the? What the hell is this? Oh God damnit.  Mom, will you stop texting me? I'm trying to relax! We're doing everything we can to keep our anxiety under control! Do you think I even wanna be here right now?! I am freaking out!  Heheh, yeah. That's pretty cool. What do you want? You think I even want to be here, Kyle?! My therapist told me I need to force myself to go out and do things to overcome my anxiety! Oh! Oh, I see! People with anxiety shouldn't be allowed at water parks. Is that it, Kyle?  Hey everybody! Just so you know, Kyle thinks people with anxiety should just stay home! Yeah! I'm trying to come out of my shell, but Dr. Kyle here is just worried about his place in line. God damnit! I seriously can't get a minute of peace!  Why is it that people who don't have a Buddha Box are always flipping Buddha Boxes off the heads of people with anxiety?!  Everyone has anxiety? Oh my God. I know what I have to do now. Yo-you're right, Kyle! You're right!  To quiet one's mind, one must have a dialog with one's self. I have found enlightenment. But there are so many others who suffer. It's very important to take the time to shut out the outside world. In the Hindu religion, there's a saying, "Namaste." It means "fuck you, I have anxiety." At first I thought it was only a few of us, but then something was said to me by Kyle. He said "Eric, my friend, everyone has anxiety." I know what you're thinking: "Fuck Kyle." And normally I would agree with you, but hear his words. Everyone has anxiety. We must recognize this disease as an epidemic. Yes, fuck Kyle, but Mayor, we have to raise money to get everyone who has anxiety the tools they need to cope. Namaste. Fuck you too. 
Bike parade? That's so dumb. What are you doing? Don't lie, Kenny! You saw that Larry kid scoring chicks with his bike, heard about the cash prize, and you decided to do the bike parade behind our backs! I know 'cause I thought the same thing!  Jesus. Is this really what it's come down to, you guys? Whatever happened to *us*? It used to always be the four of us. Always. Now Stan's moved to a farm. I have anxiety. Kenny? Nobody really talks to Kenny. And then there's just... Kyle. We used to do everything together. What if we did this like the old days? If we order everything online, we can have it delivered tomorrow!  We need props, pyrotechnics, the works! Kenny, get on your mom's laptop and start ordering streamers, sparklers and rockets! Make sure everyone ships Next Day Delivery! This is gonna be just like the old times, you guys! My stuff's here!  Shut up!  Mom, were there a bunch of packages for me? I guess it's time to face it. We aren't going to get our stuff. At the... the ma-, the ma-ma-, the mall. Guess we haven't been to the mall in a while.    The changing faces of immigrants in America as told through bicycles. This is a waste of time, you guys. 
Kyle, did you get your stuff?! I got my stuff! Yeah, dude!  Stan and Kenny got their stuff too! Bring it all over to my house! We gotta get ready for the bike parade! There's no way we can't win, you guys. We are going to kill at the bike parade. We finally did it. We worked together, we overcame adversity, and everything is finally gonna be cool again. Yeah, how do we do the changing face of immigrants in America without the Philippines?!  Kenny, no! You can't do this! We've worked so hard, and we've come so close! Oh my G- Oh my God! My anxiety! My anxiety is going off, you guys!  Oh my God! We did so much! We went through all this and he just quits?! That's it! That's it! I'm gonna shoot up the skewl! No, 'cause it's not fair! You work your ass off for nothing, and now my anxiety's back, and I'm gonna shoot up the skeewwwwl! Kyle's right.  We are. It's just Kenny fucked us again. Yeah. Hey. What if there wasn't? What if the bike parade got cancelled? We're never gonna win the bike parade, but if we get cancelled, then everybody loses. How do you get anything cancelled? You bitch about it being insensitive! "What's offensive about a bike parade?" Kyle, you small-minded piece of shit! We should cancel you just for saying that. Everybody loses, you guys! Yeah. We're gonna need poster boards, markers, and lots of glitter and glue. Yeah, how can somebody who gives you whatever you want be a bad guy?  But we're outraged about something. We need glitter and glue. It's just such bullcrap, you guys. How come everything out there is getting cancelled, but when it comes to us, we just can't do it?  That's right. we've been selfish. We can't get the parade cancelled for us. We have to do it for all the other people who want it cancelled, but their voices aren't being heard! Come on! I'm actually pissed off now!  It is nihilistic and out of touch with progressive thinking!  Who would use the bike parade like some $20 hooker? 
This sucks balls. Ever since you guys moved, everything just keeps changing. I mean, how are all us kids supposed to have any hope anymore? All I think about is all the problems our generation is inheriting: climate change, overfishing, Kyle. I mean, how are we supposed to get happy about anything?  Hey there, Stan. You input all the weed orders? Kids are being handed a world that's broken and sick. We aren't the ones who messed this planet up, but we're the ones who will pay the price.  What's going on? What did that guy do? Detention centers?  Well, this is nice! When did we start doing this? So anyone can make an anonymous tip and you can round up families and send them away? Nobody told me about this! I thought everything sucked now! Do you have a card? Do you remember last week you called me a butthole in front of Suzie Tobler? I want you to apologize for every time you've been a dick to me, Kyle. Oh! Are you sure you don't want to take that back? Uh-okay Kyle. Just remember, I gave you a chance.   That's so sweet. Ha ha. No way.  Oh, hey Kyle. So weak. Jimmy pissed me off 'cause he told the teacher I was texting in class, so I told Jimmy I'd have him sent off to a migrant detention center. He didn't believe me, so I said "Oh, I already did it to Kyle." Stan heard that, so he got pissed off and had me sent off to a migrant detention center. I know. I know it sucks. But we're stuck in here together. Come on, buys. All we have to do is try to make the most of it. ''[smiles, then sings while bouncing around]<br/>It's a hard knock life for us.<br/>It's a hard knock life for us.'' Don't it feel like the wind is always howlin'? Don't it seem like there's never any light? Santa never comes for me. Santa Claus no está aquí.  Oh, my God, Kyle. I didn't even make the connection, you know? I was just like, Oh, I'm gonna have Kyle thrown into a detention camp. That'll be sweet," and I didn't stop to think that... for you guys... it's not that sweet. Man, if I had just thought it through for like, two more minutes, I would have got you back some other way. I feel terrible, Kyle. Why, Kyle? What are you gonna do with- Aluminum foil and some scissors.  Whoa! 
Yeah, the migrant detention camp was kewl, but it kinda rubs Kyle the wrong way.  
No shots! No shots!   No! No! No! Noooooo! Oh, that's a good idea. Like, maybe, exclusive use of the tetherball court at recess for the next two months? Sweet.  I won't change my mind.  We're going home? You promise? Wait, can I get a toy from the toy chest? Cool!   Hey guys! I'm back in school! I'm allowed back, and it's all good. No. I don't have to get my shots, ever!  And they can't do anything about it, because I'm a "consciousness objector." Yeah I told the school, I said "Look, you guys, I happen to have 'religious, moral, or philosophical convictions'." And so- and I said "I believe that 'health and disease should not be controlled by vaccination'." Those are my beliefs! And besides, I don't want to risk immunizations making me artistic.   I'm sorry. What were you saying? Oh! Snot web. I'll be right back, you guys.  Can somebody get me a paper towel? I got a snot web here. [leaves the cafeteria] Consciousness objector coming through!  No, no. Nooooo! [jumps off the bed] You read me a bedtime story. You tucked me in. And then you let half the town into my room to try and give me a shot against my will.  So you go along with society and and try to force immunizations on me, even knowing the health risks! What if immunizations made my friend Timmy the way he is?! What if they made Jimmy the way he is?! What if they made Tolkien the way he is? That isn't gonna work this time, Mom! I don't want to be around you anymore!  You should have thought of that before you made this house a nightmare for me. Goodbye, Mother!  Weeaak! No, no!  Ah, AAAH!   I've gotta get out of here! Mom!   What??  Okay, doctor. I'm ready for my shot. Bad news? What are you talking about? Mom?  Noooooooo... Noooooooo... 
<poem><i> '''' It's Sloppy Joe day!</i></poem> I seriously think that Sloppy Joe day is my favorite day at school. What is this? Feesh? What kids were complaining about health and sustainability?! What kids would care at all that-  the girls! The fucking girls!  is on our lunch trays?! Oh my God. I'm about to lose my mind.  You think you can just mess with a man's lunch?! You think that your ideas about health and nutrition should be somehow interfering with mine?! You dictate what foods I can eat?!  I can't, I can't. Butters, I can't.  Agh. Fuck you, Wendy. Hey guys. How's it goin'? Yes. The girls tried to kill me, but they did not succeed. However, we cannot let the girls' protest ruin our lunch ever again! Well, their protesting is ruining my lunch! Yes, we do all have freedom of speech! But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF! They're trying to take people's lunch! They don't realize it harms people financially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  Agagagh, my lunch!  Ohm... oh my God. School cafeteria ribs. After all that yogurt and crap they gave me at the hospital? OHM. Yeah. I think maybe I like rib day even more than sloppy Joe day. It's a difficult choice.  CAN I PLEASE JUST ENJOY MY LUNCH FOR FIVE GODDAMNED MINUTES?! We all have freedom of speech, but stop talking about climate change DURING LUNCH TIME! Some of us can just enjoy some simple goddamned barbecue ribs! And I- Daah!  Oh God, they did it again to me, Butters. I think this is the Big One! Don't let me die. Don't let me die. Don't let me die, Butters.  Agh. Fuck you, Wendy.  Mr. Mackey.  These tacos look different. What kind are they? Oh, Incredible Beef tacos. That sounds nice.  Did you guys see that new Joker movie? Lunchtime!  Hey Butters!  Wait up, dude. You know what today is, right? It's Salisbury Steak day! Salisbury Steak day!  Butters, is something going on? Your lunch dances aren't the same. Guilty... about what? Yes, I think it's pretty good. The fuck is a goo man?   And that's what we have for school lunch now? That's what all the kids decided while I wasn't there? Me too. I need to have a word with the students at my school.  Hey, guys, looks like I almost missed lunch. I found out about what we're eating here at the school. I found out what it's made of and where! What are you sorry about? It's me who owes all you guys an apology.  ♪ It's Processed Meat-Like Substance Day ♪ It's Processed Meat-Like Substance Day ♪ 
Ahp, no Halloween for you, Kenny. Yeah, like you and the mummy need to do your own things sometimes. 
Titty farts! Titty farts dog wiener.  Pubic mound. Pubic mound.  Pubic mound titty farts hike!   You can't catch! That totally would have been a touchdown. Yeah, this isn't right. I think I might be able to help them.  Mr. and Mrs. White!  I'm sorry about what happened. I knew Jason pretty well. He was a shitty receiver, but he would have wanted his parents to... move on. And help a new child. A few weeks ago, I was sent somewhere. It was a place where people like you could find a way to fill that empty hole. 
The first bugbear lashes out at Stan with its broadsword.  And it hits with a 17. 4 + 2 slashing I don't think bugbears have balls. Ah huh, ah, heh heh neh no. Um, guys, we play lots of games here at Dice Studz, but today  we're playing D&D. You don't just show up and start playing, you have to generate characters and- Eheh, ha, guys, um, they're fighting a bunch of bugbears now that are led by a 12th level druid...  It is unfair, it is tyrannous, and it is wrong! Ever since these girls were allowed to join Dice Studz Gamers Club, it has been a train wreck! Every single game, they like, figure out all the rules, and they, use the rules, to like, make us look stupid! Shut up, Butters. It's not possible. It's just that we play board games for the themes. We want to be pirates, or Vikings. You know what the girls think about? They think about red cubes versus blue cubes, and how much of this equals how many victory points. They're just doing math. NO! It's it's just, different.  "Nothing we can do," he said. "Hands are tied," he said. We're gonna have to deal with this ourselves, you guys. Well you won't think they're cool when the rest of us leave Dice Studz and you're left to play only solo board games! Do they involve math? Nope, no good. We need something with lots of, like WAR and DICE and THEMATIC shit. Alright, that's it, you guys. Dice Studz Gamers Club is about to go  tabletop miniatures.  Excuse me!  We're going to play the six-hour long, very thematic Nemesis!  It is unfair. It is tyrannous, and it is wrong. Dice Studz is a board game group that brings thrills and laughter to dozens of boys at our school. But that laughter is being turned into screams as girls constantly invade with their unfairness.  And now I'd like for you to hear from my friend Scott, who has diabetes.  Terminal diabetes.  We hope that our presentation has helped to change your minds about school clubs in our country. If not, we will be back, every single day. Please, let Dice Studz be for studs. Ahhh, isn't this nice, you guys? Clean, fresh air, soothing sounds, just us boys and Star Trek: Ascendancy." "Board Girls"? How lame is that?  The fuck is this? ... Yeah, who made up that stupid rule? Dude, I really like this person. That's right! You and your stupid rules! Yeah, an unfair advantage, stupid girls! Come on, Ms. Swanson. We can go make our own club.  
So?  Fecal transplant! Whaaat? Yes! Kyle! What is your problem?! Okay, we've got contact. Are you ready with the bucket, Kenny? Place it directly under this pipe.  Now we just wait. For the flush. That's good she's not flushing yet. That means she's got more serious business, and serious business is just what we're after. You see how fat Kyle's mom is? That bitch must poop at least two-pounders. Oh, hey Kyle, What's going on? Kyle, this is the world we're living in, okay? People are finding new and exciting ways to get healthy, and who are we to stand in their way?  That is 100% untrue. Very nice, very nice. Wouldn't know. Whose? [pats Stan on the shoulder] It's all right, Stan. Don't cry. You see, ma'am, our little friend Kenny here is dying, and he's... he's just the biggest Patriots fan. Kind of, like a Michael Jackson kind of thing. [Kenny mumbles something] Oh gosh, we're losin' him! We need to make this happen quickly, ma'am. Uh, ma'am? Hello, ma'am. We are the darling children whose dying friend is all set to meet Tom Brady. [thinking, "I wonder why everyone keeps taking really long pauses after they talk."] Mr. Brady, can we just see your basement really fast? You don't get to be part of Turd Burglars now, Kyle! [Kyle continues forward and stops at the bookcase] 
 Hehyeah. Scott, you can't be with Sophie Gray. She has diabetes. No, Scott, if you and Sophie have a baby, it'll have super diabetes. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that causes a crater on the Earth.    Oh, that's pretty cool. Agh, goddamnit.  With what? You don't wanna go around messin' with that.  You want my advice? You're better off, Scott. Let some other fool have his life ruined.  Do you know what love is, Scott? I'll tell you one thing: it's not the happy ending that Disney movies promised us. There's just frustration, and anger, and pain. Relationships is diabetes times ten. Fine. I'll tell you how to get Disney+. But when you feel like killing yourself in two years, don't do it in front of me. This is bullcrap! Give me that thing! Goddamnit!   Hey, don't worry, Sophie. We can go watch it together at Tolkien's house. His family has the best AV equipment. Hello ma'am. I'm Eric Cartman. How are you? Yeah yeah, nobody cares, Clyde.  Not as sorry as I am, Sophie. Uh oh, looks like you got some pie on your face, Scott. 
 This isn't good, you guys. You know what it means when our parents have no Christmas spirit? Shitty presents. We're screwed, you guys. Boy, people sure have the holiday spirit now. Butters, your mom has so much holiday spirit that she's riding an ATV with her tits out.  Does this mean you all have the Christmas spirit again? 
Yes, teacher, I'm here. I can't wait to start  schoo... schoo... schoo... oo... oo... Oh no? Can you guys hear me? I just said eh... eh... eh... eh... <poem><i>I'm cut off from the world, isolated, alone. This is what I can existencing. No one can touch me or boss me around. Social distancing-</i></poem>   Yeah Social distancing, Mom.  Computer keeps freezing, Mom. Maybe, if you were an essential worker, we could afford faster Internet. Oh, what a folly a shower seems when my generation is being denied their lives. I can't see my friends. I can't even go to school. How I miss Kyle. Heh heh heh heh. What... the fuck... are you talking about? We can't go back to school: there's a fucking pandemic. They can't do that! Oh no, I see! There's all this horrible stuff going on in the world, but apparently, Cartman's life doesn't matter!   Dude, you are not gonna believe this.  Is your dad home, Kyle? We need to talk to a lawyer! Mr. Broflovski?! They're gonna try and make us go back to school. Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle! They want us to go back. To school! "So?" What the fuck is-? You really wanna go back to that slavery?! You crazy, psychotic... Kyle, we need to get a lawyer to stop schools from forcing us back! Now, whatever your messed-up beliefs are about "wanting to go to school" You don't have to be on Zoom, there's a million ways around it! Mark my words, Kyle: first they'll force us back to school, then they'll take social distancing away from us completely, and I'll be out of my room having to hang out with you!  Oh my God. They won't get away with this! Pandemic! There's a pandemic! You can't make me go to school!  You can't! Argh! Araraaagh! Nonono! Nonono! You can't make me! You hear me?! You can't make us stay here! This is a violation of our freedom! Who's with me, guys?! Oh my God, I forgot how much it sucks to be around everybody! I think I'm gonna be sick, all over Kyle!  This is bullshit!  Stan's right. If we want things to go back to normal, we have to do it ourselves. I sure as hell will! The way it was! Online, in our own rooms! Wait, what? What normal are you talking about? I'm talking about normal, like three days ago, when everything was awesome. Without any employees? What, do you expect us to just, just... build our own bear? Stan, you really need employee assistance with this. Oh no! You're not ending this pandemic!  ''Your'' only chance! For ''your'' normal, not ''mine!'' I am ''not'' going back to school! 
 Stan, Kyle, can you come over here real quick? Just come here please, it's important. Hey, Kenny. I got the guys, okay? You wanna talk or you want me to talk?  The four of us just seem really different towards each other and we're worried the past year has put a strain to our broship. Kenny was saying he wants to do everything he can to save the broship, and I agree with him. So we had a really positive talk about it during lunch, and Kenny shared some ideas of how maybe we can navigate through this, and I think we came up with a great idea. Okay, so, you know how chicks have periods right? It's true! Women have "periods" where they bleed from their vagina. Remember earlier today, Stan, you said our teacher was wearing white? So when we talked I said to Kenny "Oh, what if the teacher got her period?" which cheered us up a bit and then we realized today was hamburger day for lunch. There was lots of ketchup laying around. So me and Kenny snuck into the classroom during recess and put it on the teacher's chair, and now when we get back to class there's gonna be a bunch of ketchup  It's going to be amazing, you guys. I'm so excited!  Oh, my God.   That's nasty, teacher. Don't have your period during class time! You guys, I think that might have been the single most hilarious thing we've ever done. Which one should we post, you guys? Should we post the one where you can see the most blood on teacher's ass or the one where she makes the dumbest face? Hey, at least Kenny and I were doing something to try and get that spark back. You know 30 percent of broships didn't make it through the pandemic? Yeah, you missed it! It was the best thing ever!  We put ketchup in the teacher's seat and made her think it was her period! Yeah, pretty much greatest day of our lives. It's not gonna be hard. They'll bring in some lame ass teacher who's desperate to work. How bad can it be? Hey, broships. You ready for some substitute teacher action? This should be fun! Oh, dear Christ, what have we done? Wow, people are really pissed at us for doing the period joke, you guys. Well, because I told them we all did. People know we're bros and that we do everything together! That's right, Kyle, you did nothing. You knew about the prank, you could have stopped it at any time, but you didn't say a word. Silence is violence, Kyle. Oh, my God... Maybe our broship didn't survive.  Hey, Kenny. Guys? Guys, come on. You agreed to counseling.  Hey, Mr. Mackey. We, uh, we've been having a lot of problems and um, we all want to work on our broship, don't we guys? You know this pandemic has been a pressure cooker, and we just feel like we're going through the brotions. You know? Silence is violence, Kyle. Silence is violence. How do we do that?  Oh, hey, hi. We're with the nonprofit service Kids for Kommunity. Both spelled with a K. Yeah bros! Kommunity Kidz spelled with a K. Gets 'em every time. You God damn old bitch! What?! This is becoming the most expensive period joke we ever did!  Oh, you fucking slut! This is why we keep old people in the back of the line!  Hi, Mrs. Nelson, it's Eric Cartman. Mrs. Nelson, we would like for you to come back to school tomorrow, because... we have COVID-19 vaccinations. And it was so uncalled for and so wrong. I mean, especially because we're guys. I mean, dudes sitting around coming up with period jokes, like, how old are we? Seriously? You are so important. Which is why it was so not funny what we did. I mean, what is funny about blood coming out of a woman's vagina? Like, it's sexist, first of all, and you know what else? It's just lazy. Just like dialing it in, that's what we were doing. We were just dialing it in. Hey, we will be there. Period.  Did you guys hear what I said? Relax, guys. She's gonna come. Wow, everyone just really wants a shot.   Oh, my God.  You guys, oh my God, seriously.  You guys know Mr. Lawson? Jenny Lawson's dad?  He's offering us 2,000 bucks for a vaccination. Dude, people really want their shot. I'm asking around to see what they're willing to pay for it. I'm a little Harvey Weinstein. Kyle, this is what our broship needs! We can sell these and go on vacations together, go to shows and theme parks! What's best for us is thousands of dollars. That's always what's best!  I don't know why you don't stand up to him more, it's really disappointing. I can't believe we're actually doing this. There are people out there who really need these vaccines -- who have cash. The fuck are you talking about, Scott? Lil' Qties? With a "Q" and an apostrophe after the "L"? That's way better than Kommunity Kids, guys. I told you, we're getting lazy. Look, you guys have a right to say and believe whatever you want, okay? But what you believe is really stupid. Hi, Mrs. Nelson! How are you? And, you know, we just ran into a little hiccup, so we wanted to see if you could meet us somewhere else for the vaccine. No, no, Mrs. Nelson, it's not a prank! Okay, fine, we'll be there, okay? Just sit tight.  She's not gonna come meet us, Kyle! He what?! Alright, guys. I guess it's time we all had the talk we never wanted to have.  Kenny, you wanna go get on your iPad for a minute? We just -- we really need to talk for a second, Kenny. Look, I downloaded Madagascar 3. You wanna watch with your Troll headphones?  I've been trying as hard as I can to hold things together, but I have to admit... I'm just going through the "brotions." I think I have a plan. Alright, here's the situation --  But we all want what's best for Kenny, so we have to find a way to compromise and move on with our lives. So how do we do it? We use... a 2-2-3.  Kyle, you have Kenny for two days starting on Monday. I have Kenny Thursday and Friday, and then, Stan, you get him for the weekend. Then we switch where I have Kenny starting Monday, Stan gets two days and Kyle gets a weekend. Okay, so we can go alternating weeks --  Each one of us has Kenny for six days and then we rotate.  Alternating weeks with a midweek visit. We have longer stretches, but a change for a break.  Alternating weeks with midweek overnight.  Everything okay, buddy? We're almost done in here, Kenny. You liking that birthday cake-flavored ice cream?  the 2-2-5-5 rotation, where the weekends can actually fluctuate.  The 2-2-3, I agree. This way we don't have to be bros but Kenny still has the best possible life.  This isn't our fight anymore, Kyle. Alright... then let's get those vaccines to the teachers. Well, come on you guys! Let's get inside! Of course we made it!  'Cause our broship can survive anything! Yeah. Thanks. I'll be fine. I already have some new bros I'm hanging out with.  Yeah?  
This is bullshit! They can't take our pajamas from us! Who does the principal think he is?! We didn't do fucking anything wrong! We keep not doing anything wrong, and we keep getting fucked! Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. We are not just going to stand for this?! Brah, we can have some Goddamn balls! What does Matt Damon say on that Bitcoin commercial? Fortune favors the brave. Yes, everyone did. But they were brave in doing so. We have to stand up for ourselves, you guys. I say we go right to the principal's office and tell him what's up, brah.  ''panting]'' Oh, God! I-I was at the school and it– it was pajama day, and I– I didn't have pajamas on and then I died! And then I died! Yeah, get 'em, mom! Tell him to fuck off! No, I can't stay home because you have to go to work because fucking Matt Damon told you fortune favors the brave and now you lost all your fucking money! Fuck yes, mom, that was fucking sweet! Wait, no, I want to wear my fucking pajamas to school! You fucked it up, Mom! Ladies and gentlemen. We have been at war for too long. Yesterday, Wendy Testaburger came to me and said we need to get the boys and girls together to find a solution for pajama day. I was delighted.  We must put our differences aside, because we all want one thing. The right to be in our jam jams this Friday all cozy wozy. Comfy womfy, cozy wozy, the point is, we are getting fucked. That's right. We need all of us. Boys and girls working together. And so together, what are we going to do? Shoot up the school, nice. It's just done a lot. Anything a little more original? That is just the kind of manipulative, psychotic thinking that we needed. But not too brave or else Matt Damon will come and take all our money. "This is really nice"? Aw, God damnit! Fuck yes! It's opposite day! 
 Whatsup, dog. Well yeah, I just figured. J.R.R. Tolkien has an "L" in it? That's gay. Who did you think Tolkien was named after?  I think Stan's lost his marbles. 
 Mom! Where the hell have you been?! I've been home from school for like 45 minutes! I didn't have anything to eat except Nutella. I was about to call Child Services! What? I'm your job.  No! Wha– what job could you possibly have?! You don't know how to do anything!  A what? Hey Butters, I need your help. Butters, I have some shocking news... My mom got a job. What? No, my mom got a job. My mom is dumb as shit and somebody is paying her to do something.  Have you ever heard of a real estate agent, Butters? Yeah, well, neither had I.  So I looked it up on a bunch of those shows and stuff. You don't do anything. You just look nice and hug people and then when someone buys a house, you make money. It's more than a good deal, Butters. It's fucking legal theft. If my mom can be a real estate agent, then literally anyone in the world can.  We've got all these people moving from the cities into our town. I can probably be a millionaire in just a few days time.  I won't forget this when I'm rich. Okay, this is a three bedroom house with bathrooms. Front yard and backyard. Oh, I just got some clients here looking to relocate. These people are from the city. I got a job as a real estate agent, mom. Neither are you– Mom, real estate is an open market. You're not the only one who gets to take advantage of all the city people.   Okay, so this is a three bedroom two and a half bath– come on in, everybody!  You got about 2,300 square feet and there is a finished basement. Detached garage– stairs head up to the master, which is an en suite, if I remember correctly. Let's get on back to the kitchen...  You've got a nice, big kitchen, pretty new appliances. Door in the back gets you out to the garage. Just showing them your house. Come on, let's check out the second floor– Nice, big bathroom for the two rooms up here. Tweek's grandma is staying in one of the rooms, which serves as an office space when she's not here. And then, we are back down to the spacious living room! Yeah, we're just about done– well, what do you guys think? I'm sorry, I didn't get that... Oh, sure, well, let's head on out now. We can take a lot at Jimmy's house.  I think I can get you 4 million for this place. I'll be in touch.  Hey, guys, it's Eric from South Park Realty Group. Are you dreaming of moving out of the city and into the countryside? I want you to check out Clyde's house. This is a 2,300 square foot mid colonial home – detached garage – now listing for just $3.5 million. Let's check it out. This house is so spacious. I think my cameraman Butters can attest to this. Isn't this nice, Butters? Just look at these amenities. These giant, glass double doors lead to the unfinished backyard. Plenty of room here for a pool or a horse stable. Get out of that sewage drain you call a city and start living the country life you've always wanted. South Park Realty Group. Get out of the city and into beautiful South Park. How's it going? This is Eric Cartman with South Park Realty Group. Well, I'm standing here with some clients who want to make a deal on this Highgate place. They wanna offer $175,000. $175,000 is a great number—$25,000 below asking, but you know you're never gonna get $200,000.  Don't worry, these deals are always like this. The HVAC all needs to be redone and you know it. Okay, that's fine mom, why don't you go to fucking hell?!  It always gets like this with agents. Don't worry, she'll call back, watch.  South Park Realty Group, this is Eric. Okay, okay... $180,000, but that's as high as I can go.  We got it. Welcome, home buyers! I'm Eric with South Park Realty Group. We hope you're enjoying the provided food and beverages.  Yes, that's right. You know, here at South Park Realty Group, we've had some amazing listings—Craig's house, Jimmy's house—but I think you'll all agree that what we have for you today is a whole nother level. I present to you... Tolkien's house! These owners have just moved out to a farm, and we're listing this house at just under $50 million dollars. Yes! Go on in! Check it out! Make me an offer! This is my listing, mom!  This is my listing, mom! Agh! Help! Somebody call Child Protective Services! I am not doing a co-brokering deal, mom, it's not gonna happen! That isn't true. You just want to offer the sellers a lower commission to list this house and it's not going to work, mom! When I close this deal, mom, I'm gonna be the richest kid in town! Well, we'll just see in 30 days, won't we? Except for some of my deals, which have a 45 day contingency period!  And you won't get any other job? And your only job will be me? And, you'll be home when I get back from school and have my mid-afternoon meal already on the table? I think it's cool we live in a hot dog.  Weak... I live in a hot dog. 
Right here! Alright, sweet! Me and Kenny and our teenagers are gonna smoke you guys! Yes! Yes! Yes!! You didn't get me! You didn't hit me, Kyle! The BBs bounced off a leaf or something, 'cause–   Oh, my God… this is the greatest day of my fucking life. Yes! Yes!! That was so awesome!! You guys, Airsoft fucking rules! This is–  Ow! Hit! Hit! This is sweet! Best thing ever! Yeah, well, Team Floppy Weiner will get you guys next time!  Can we promise each other we'll do Airsoft, like, all the time?  Dude, Swamp Sniper rules.  What– What are you doing, dude? You– You need to use my bathroom?  Kyle? What are you doing here? Well, at least I'm not the only one dealing with this crap. No, my teenager wants more lotion.  All this guy does is hang out in the bathroom and go through like two bottles of lotion a day. I swear I don't know how soft you could possibly want your hands to be.  Damn right! Team Floppy Weiner will destroy you guys! You have to find me first! Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me! There's one over by the registers. No, you are not taking the lotion!  Okay, I'm sorry you hate me. Just wanna fucking play Airsoft, buddy. On the rare occasion that my teenager isn't in the bathroom, all he does is talk about his miserable life. I'm like—okay, dude, I've got problems too. But of course teenagers don't care about your problems. I'm like, "look, buddy, I live in a hot dog. Ok? Like, maybe let's stop bitching and just play Airsoft." But you can't say that because then they're just gonna— Yes, yes.  Camping?  Okay, looks like the tents are set up—can you come out now? Okay, well, you should probably finish up. I know you took the lotion in there. You really don't need soft hands for camping.  Come on, dude. No shit in the world takes that long. Up to here! Guys, things have to improve. They just have to. I've never seen anyone so disrespectful. I've never seen Kenny like this, ever. That's awesome. I wish I had a dad. And that I didn't live in a hot dog. I know where he is…  What you do to Jegens Lotion isn't right.   Aaaagh! Yes… yes, I live in a hot dog! It's right over here! Come on, you guys, help me get it all ready! 
 Yeah, it's super fun. St. Patrick's Day rules. Awesome... green hamburgers... How clever... Hello, sir, we are with the Clover Club. We try to spread a little St. Patrick's Day cheer by donating baked goods to prison inmates who cannot celebrate this festive time.  How's your St. Patrick's Day going, Butters? Awesome.
