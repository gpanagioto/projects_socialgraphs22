 Uuuurrr.  Mmmmm. Uugh!  Uh, ughn.  Where... where am I? Where am I? What's goin' on? Huh? Where am I? Hi. Where am I? It's 1999?? What? Thirty-two months?! Aaaa!   AAAAAAA! Whoa, oh. What?!! Rrrowrrr! Oh hi. What are ''you'' doing here? Viewing hours are 10 to 6. Wow. That's really nice of you, kid. Thanks! My name is Larry. Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?  Arrrggh! Leslie. It's me, Larry.  Your husband? Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years? That was ''me!'' So you... remarried. Larry! Didn't anybody send out a search party? Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused. ''You're'' Leslie. I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone.   I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again. Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over. What is that?  They're coming for me! Okay, boys. Thanks.  I got my ticket. I have to go to Platform B. Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys. You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about. After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world! Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends! Oh, poo! Huh?  Whah?!  I've got you pinned. I win.  Nooo!  Oohh!  Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines! I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends!  Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya!
