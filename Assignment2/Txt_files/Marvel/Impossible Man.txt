The Impossible Man is a [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#P|Poppupian]] from the planet Poppup and has shape-changing abilities. The character is primarily used for comedy as he is portrayed as a lonely, attention seeking alien that often annoys those around him, especially the Fantastic Four. Over the years, the Impossible Man created a wife called The Impossible Woman and also had a son named Adolf Impossible.

The Impossible Man has made various appearances in Marvel cartoon series, such as the [[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|1978]] and [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|1994]] ''Fantastic Four'' series as well as ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]''.

==Publication history==
The Impossible Man first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #11 (Feb 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. According to Lee in a 1970 interview, this "was the worst-selling ''Fantastic Four'' we've ever had". In Lee's opinion, the green alien on the cover was "too unusual and too frivolous."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fingeroth |first1=Danny |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=The Stan Lee Universe |date=2011 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490304 |pages=97–102}}</ref>

After a long absence, Impossible Man returned in ''Fantastic Four'' #175 (Oct 1976) and visited the Marvel Comics office. At the end of the story, he was adopted by the Fantastic Four. This time, the character became popular.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=90}}</ref> He remained a regular part of the comic until #195 (June 1978), when Sue told him that she was tired of him, and he turned into a bee and flew away.

Originally, there were no limits to Impossible Man's transforming abilities - he convincingly imitated Sue Richards in ''Fantastic Four'' #175 (Oct 1976) and President [[Jimmy Carter]] in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #27 (May 1977) - but in ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants Annual]]'' #3 (Sept 1987), he could only turn into something that was green and purple, and that limitation has stuck ever since.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cronin |first1=Brian |title=When The Impossible Man Got Stuck With the Colors Purple and Green! |url=https://www.cbr.com/fantastic-four-impossible-man-purple-green-stuck/ |website=CBR.com |access-date=18 January 2020 |date=June 14, 2019}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

=== 1960s ===
When the Impossible Man first appeared, he was different from previous guest stars in that he was not a villain. The team first meet him at the Flamingo restaurant when they are summoned there to investigate a disturbance.  Written by Lee to be a prankster and hedonist, the Impossible Man claimed to belong to the alien race of [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#P|Poppupians]] from planet Poppup in the "Tenth Galaxy", who all share a collective consciousness and the ability to shapeshift, as their planet is so dangerous they have the ability to evolve very quickly.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=184}}</ref> Seeking amusement, the character visits Earth for a vacation by turning himself into a spaceship, talking of a Poppup Tourist Bureau. After finding the [[superhero]] team the Fantastic Four and realizing nobody else on Earth has his power (therefore concluding he is the most powerful being on Earth), he constantly harasses them until they decide to ignore him and tell other people to do the same, forcing the Impossible Man to leave as he finds Earth so boring, and saying Earth will never get their tourist business. He gets his name after the Thing claims he is "impossible".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol 1 #11 (February 1963)</ref>

=== 1970s ===
The character does not appear again until 1976. Acting as a ''deus ex machina'' in a storyline involving the cosmic entity and world-devourer [[Galactus]], the Impossible Man convinces him to consume his homeworld Poppup instead of Earth, causing Galactus to seemingly perish from 'cosmic indigestion'. Since the Poppupians were a shared consciousness they were happy to sacrifice their planet to stop Galactus, knowing that their culture would live on in the embodiment of its most adventurous member.<ref name=FF175>''Fantastic Four'' #175 (Oct. 1976)</ref> The Impossible Man then makes a humorous appearance at the offices of Marvel Comics, where he causes havoc until Stan Lee promises to give him his own title.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #176 (Nov. 1976)</ref>

He offers peripheral assistance to the Fantastic Four when they are trapped in the [[Negative Zone]] by the [[Frightful Four]], a team of their enemies.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #177-178 (Dec. 1976-Jan. 1977)</ref> The Impossible Man impersonates [[Jimmy Carter]], on the day when he is to be inaugurated as [[President of the United States]] and briefly takes his place to foil an attempt to enslave him during an adventure with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the cyborg [[Deathlok]].<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #27 (May 1977)</ref> He later saves the [[Invisible Woman]] from a fall<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #183 (June. 1977)</ref> and becomes fascinated with Earth [[film|movies]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #184-185 (July - Aug. 1977)</ref> When returning to the [[Baxter Building]], headquarters of the Fantastic Four, the Impossible Man is surprised and defeated by the villain Klaw, who, in an alliance with the [[Molecule Man]], attempts to kill the Fantastic Four.<ref name="Fantastic Four' 1977">''Fantastic Four'' #186 (Sep. 1977)</ref> During the course of the storyline, the character recovers and, courtesy of his abilities, mimics and defeats Klaw in turn<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #187 (Oct. 1977)</ref> and assists the Fantastic Four in stopping the Molecule Man.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #188 (Nov. 1977)</ref> The character continued his trend of general disruption during a visit to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] with the Invisible Girl.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #193-195 (Apr.-July 1978)</ref>

=== 1980s ===
After helping the Thing defeat several villains at a party, the Impossible Man observes the Thing with his partner [[Alicia Masters]] and becomes lonely. The character then decides to reproduce - here an asexual process - by splitting in two.  This creates fellow Poppupian the '''Impossible Woman'''.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #60 (Feb. 1980)</ref> The pair later attempt to recreate their race and create the ''Impossible Kids'', with the entire "family" visiting the Thing.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #86</ref> When the Impossible Woman is missing, the character hires private investigator [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]] to locate her,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #45 (Aug. 1982)</ref> and has an encounter with the mutant [[X-Men]] after stealing artifacts from Earth to settle a supposed ''family dispute'' with the other members of his race.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #7 (Dec. 1983)</ref>

More comedic adventures followed, with the Impossible Man engaging in a shapeshifting competition with [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]],<ref name=autogenerated1>''The New Mutants'' Annual #3 (Jan. 1987)</ref> causing havoc on an alternate universe version of Earth,<ref>''Excalibur'' #14 (Nov. 1989)</ref> and trying to obtain the movie rights to the [[autobiography]] of professional sidekick [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #25 (Nov. 1989)</ref>

=== 1990s ===
The Impossible Man finds and teases the cosmic being the [[Silver Surfer]] on two occasions, pleading for him to develop a sense of humor before battling the titan [[Thanos]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #33 (Jan. 1990) & #36 (Apr. 1990)</ref> The character returns to Earth and causes more mischief,<ref>''Impossible Man Summer Vacation Spectacular'' #1 & 2 (Aug. 1990 & 1991)</ref> encounters the hero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] while looking for a lost child,<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #91 (Dec. 1991)</ref> starts a bar fight,<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #97 (June 1992)</ref> watches the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] win a galactic [[marathon]],<ref>''Quasar'' #58 (May 1994)</ref> and invited various otherwise un-contacted heroes and supervillains to the wedding of Rick Jones.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #417 (June 1994)</ref>

After a brief encounter with the young superhero team the [[New Warriors]],<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #162 (Sep. 1994)</ref> the character enlists the aid of mutant team [[X-Force]] to instill some pride in his children,<ref>''X-Force & Cable'' Annual (Dec. 1995)</ref> and enters into a wager with the alternate universe [[imp]] [[Mister Mxyzptlk]].<ref>''Silver Surfer/Superman'' (Nov. 1996)</ref>

=== 2000s ===
The Impossible Man and the Poppupians make a cameo appearance in [[Noh-Varr]]'s origin story.<ref>''Marvel Boy'' #5 (Dec. 2000)</ref>

The Impossible Man returns to Earth disguised as the Silver Surfer, and after teasing the hero [[Spider-Man]] warns of an alien invasion. The Impossible Man's race are also revealed to have survived, with their consciousness stored inside the character. With the aid of the Fantastic Four, the aliens and the newly reborn Poppupians are transported off world, merging into one race on Spider-Man's suggestion.<ref>''[[Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four]]'' #1-4 (May - Aug. 2007)</ref>

=== 2010s ===
Later during the [[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]], the Impossible Man confronts Mikaboshi, trying to humor and reason with him while shapeshifting in various forms to divert him, but the Chaos King tires of him and brutally dispatches him. Impossible Man's last words were "I thought we were just playing around..."<ref>''Chaos War: Chaos King'' #1</ref>

Impossible Man returns to Earth where he witnesses a battle between [[Hulk]], [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], and [[Xemnu]]. Impossible Man uses his magic to combine Hulk and Red Hulk into the Compound Hulk. Impossible Man watches as the Compound Hulk fights Xemnu's minion Kluh (a smart version of the Gray Hulk).<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #30</ref>

Impossible Man is later shown to have a son named Adolf Impossible who has many of his father's fantastic powers and has a much more introverted personality. This caused Impossible Man to label Adolf as "entirely too possible" and plead with the [[Future Foundation]] to accept him and allow him to grow as a person.<ref>''FF'' vol. 2 #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Impossible Man's unique physiology enables him to take on virtually any form via molecular manipulation, an [[Sound effect|effect]] commonly accompanied by a "Pop!" sound. He can mimic the properties of objects or humanoid beings at will.

The Impossible Man and his mate are able to survive in the vacuum of space for months without sustenance by inducing a low-metabolic rate onto themselves.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol 1 #5 (May 1983)</ref>

The Impossible Man possesses total knowledge of Earth's popular culture.

==Other versions==

===Wha...Huh?===
Impossible Man appears in the spoof comic "Wha...Huh?" in the segment titled "What If Identity Crisis Happened in the Marvel Universe". He appears as a villain that few of the heroes remember.<ref>''Wha...Huh?'' #1 (January 2005)</ref>

===The Cross-Time Caper===
The Impossible Man appears in ''Excalibur'', during the Cross-Time Caper. He has populated an analogue of the Earth with multiple twisted versions of the superheroes of the Marvel Universe (such as Daredevil, the 'Man without Common Sense').  This version of the Earth is destroyed by Galactus, who deems it "Too silly to be allowed to exist", and deems the Impossible Man as "In your own way... as great a threat as the Phoenix". Once Galactus leaves, Impossible Man repopulates the planet effortlessly, allowing the mayhem to begin again. His powers in this reality generate a 'Pip' rather than a 'Pop'.<ref>''Excaliber'' Vol 1 #14 (November 1989)</ref>
