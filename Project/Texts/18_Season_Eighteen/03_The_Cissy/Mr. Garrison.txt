Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.  Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girl's room! Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants. Actually,  it's more like a royal flush.
