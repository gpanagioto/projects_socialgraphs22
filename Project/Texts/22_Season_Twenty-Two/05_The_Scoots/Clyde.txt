As soon as the school bell rings, we find the nearest scooters and begin trick or treating in Butters' neighborhood here. Then at 3 p.m. we-  Cover it! Cover it!  Oh. Hey Kenny. You wanna trick or treat with us? What about Stan and Kyle and those guys? Yeah, look, don't tell anybody, but, um... we're gonna trick or treat on e-scooters this year. We're seriously gonna rake in the candy. Problem is, e-scooters work with a phone and pretty sure  you don't h-have one Dude, it's trick or treat. It's not something we're just willing to mess around with, okay?  Fine by us. So what are you gonna be for Halloween? Does anyone have a signal?
