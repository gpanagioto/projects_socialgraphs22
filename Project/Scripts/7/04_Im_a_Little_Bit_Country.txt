South Park Elementary, day. The bell rings. The fourth graders are still chatting as Mr. Garrison enters.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?

Mr. Slave

[at his own little desk off to the side] All donesy wunsy. [has a clipboard to prove it]

Mr. Garrison

Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problem.

Cartman

[searching his notebook] Math homework, Math homework. Where did I file that?

Mr. Garrison

[about to write on the board, but turns around] Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. [the kids quickly stare at each other]

-----


South Park Elementary, front entrance. The door open and all the kids run out. A cloud of paper signals their exit. Some of them twirl with delight. The boys come out singing.

The Boys

We got out of schoo-l! No more school toda-ay!

Kyle

What should we do?

Stan

Let's go see a movie! [they stop in their tracks as they hear "No war! No war!"]

Protesters

No war! No war! [a sea of them mill around on South Park Avenue waving various signs around] No war! No war! [One man wields an American flag. He lowers it while another reaches for a lighter and set the flag aflame.] No war! No war! [three men break into Tele's through its large window and steal various TVs] No war! No war! No war!

Mr. Mackey

[walks up to the boys with several signs in his hands] No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh uh, here you go, boys. [hands each of them a sign] These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?!

A voice

Excuse me, boys. [the boys look and the adult is shown] Tom Stansel, HBC news. Can you kids tell me why you marched out of school today? [behind him is the cameraman and an assistant, and behind her, the news van]

Stan

[pause] Uh... war?

Tom

Right. What about the war?

Kyle

[pause] Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?

Tom

Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay?

Kyle

[looks at his sign] Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.

Stan

Yeah. [the mic moves back to him as he looks at his sign] War is not my voice.

Cartman

[reading Kenny's sign] Bush is a Naizi

Skeeter

[arrives with a crowd] Hey all you un-American bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! [moves his right thumb in front of his shoulder and to his right. With him are Jimbo, Ned, Stuart, and Craig's father Tom]

Mr. Mackey

Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?

Protesters

Yeah! Right!

Stuart

If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!

Supporters

Yeah! Right!

Randy

The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!

Skeeter

Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses!

Tom

Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say?

Cartman

...Eh the... Foggy who? [seconds later, both sides rush each other and attack]

-----


South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. He stares at the children angrily, his arms crossed.

Mr. Garrison

[drops his arm, putting his right hand on his hip] Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves! [crosses his arms again] Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!

Butters

Mmuh well, not really, no.

Mr. Garrison

Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!

Class

Awwwwww!

Mr. Garrison

SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! [walks off]

-----


South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom, moments later. The class has separated in groups of four and five. Group 1: Jimmy, Red, Clyde, Bebe, Wendy. Group 2: Butters, Jordan, Kevin, Tolkien. Group 3: Cartman, Kenny, Stan, Kyle. Group 4: Tweek, Pip, blond boy, Craig, another boy. All are studying quietly. Camera angle moves from the front of the room to the side of the room opposite the door.

Cartman

[beginning to slack off] Ugh. Ughuh. [tries to resume studying, but his eyes grow heavy. He panics] I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! [yawns loudly and promptly sleeps on his book]

Kyle

[smacks Cartman] Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!

Cartman

But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.

Stan

[pointing] You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!

Cartman

Maaaa. M-maaaa.

Kyle

[annoyed] SHUT UP AND STUDY!

Cartman

Maaaa. Mah mah mh. [reluctantly returns to reading. He begins to fidget, then reads more, then fidgets again, turns the page, fidgets once more, then just thinks] Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days? [repeats the question, his voice fading at each repetition] In those days? In those days? In those days?

Kyle

[noticing] What are you doing?

Cartman

I'm trying to have a flashback.

Kenny

(A what?)

Cartman

You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!

Stan

No, you just have to study.

Cartman

No. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second. [thinks] Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then? [repeats the last two words, his voice fading at each repetition] Back then? Back then? Back then? [nothing happens. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at him] Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me. [his voice begins to fade and he begins moving his hands around like a pantomime. The camera closes in] With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.

Kyle

That isn't gonna work, dumbass!

Mr. Slave

Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.

Stan

[from behind his book] Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!

Cartman

[throws a fit] Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!

-----


South Park Avenue. The opposing groups face each other in front of the tallest building in town. Skeeter paints a line across the span of the street and looks up.

Skeeter

There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. [the war supporters begin to clamor]

Randy

How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!

Protesters

Hahahaha, yeah.

Jimbo

You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side of the town!

Protester

Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office.

Stuart

Well your side has the grocery store.

Jimbo

Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.

Gerald

Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?

Jimbo

W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.

Townsfolk

Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.

Skeeter

Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.

Randy

He's right. [looks at Sheila] Boy, do I feel like a fool. [moments later, both sides attack each other again. Among the skirmishes: Kenny's mom attacks Gerald, Sheila attacks Ned]

-----


Cartman's house, upstairs. The boys walk down the hallway and reach Cartman's room. He's rigged up a way to ... knock himself out. Three pulley wheels and a nail guide a string tied to the door across the entrance, up the wall, and back to the top of the door entrance. At the other end of the string is a big rock.

Kyle

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're supposed to be studying! [the boys stop at the entrance to Cartman's room]

Cartman

That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. [tests the tautness of the string]

Stan

How?!

Cartman

All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!

Kyle

Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!

Cartman

Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Kenny looks at them. They clear the doorway. Kyle stands on one side, Stan and Kenny on the other. Cartman backs up, clears his throat, then begins to walk with purpose] Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. [trips the string. The rock immediately falls on his head, knocking him out. He moans a few times.]

Kyle

Cartman? Cartman?? [the boys gather around Cartman. Kyle turns him over.]

Cartman

Benjamin Franklin?

Kyle

No, turdpants, it's Kyle!

Cartman

[touches Kyle, then in a weak raspy voice] Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!

-----


City Hall, day. Both sides of the war issue are in the office.

Townsfolk

Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

Mayor McDaniels

Okay, people. What are we rambling about now?

Randy

[steps forward] Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.

Skeeter

[steps forward, past a few war supporters] That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!

Gerald

There was no war months ago!

Skeeter

Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!

Randy

Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music propaganda!

Stuart

Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! [both side begin to clamor again]

Mr. Mackey

Well up yours, rednecks!

Townsfolk

Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

Mayor McDaniels

Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.

Jimbo

All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!

Randy

Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!

Skeeter

We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!

Gerald

Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!

-----


Cartman's house, night. The front door opens and in walk the boys.

Stan

Cartman?

Kyle

Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! [there's debris all over the living room. The boys arrive at Cartman hanging from a candy-cane colored swing set with the swings removed. Beneath him is a tub of water. Cartman has it rigged so that he pulls a string, which releases him and at the same time triggers a sledgehammer, which hits a box, which is supposed to land in the tub with him.]

Cartman

Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.

Stan

Oh no...

Cartman

Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers!

Kyle

Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!

Cartman

I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!

Stan

Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.

Cartman

Or a really sweet one. [a bell is heard]

TV OH

Your Tivo is full.

Cartman

Whoa, here it goes! [triggers the sledgehammer as he falls. Both he and the TiVo land in the tub, and the house shorts out. Cartman is electrocuted as he lands in the water. The boys spend a few seconds in the darkness looking at Cartman, wondering if he'll come to. Kenny turns and walks away slowly]

Kyle

Cartman? [no response] Cartman??

Stan

Aww crap.

-----


The flashback. Cartman is seen in period dress, face down on a dirt road. He comes to, looks up, sits up and looks around, then notices his clothes. He quickly rises and looks at Philadelphia in the distance.

Cartman

Ohhh awesome!!! [a horse-drawn carriage approaches, driven by a teenage boy.]

Official messenger boy

Worthy young lad, are you all right?

Cartman

Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?

Official messenger boy

This year? Why it's 1776, it is.

Cartman

Oho yes! I did it I did it!

Official messenger boy

Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's house to get a very important document, I am.

Cartman

Oho kick fucking ass, dude! [approaches the carriage and climbs up to sit alongside the driver]

Official messenger boy

Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?

Cartman

No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.

Official messenger boy

A flashback? Why, what is that?

Cartman

Well you know, it's a... [points at something] H-ho, awesome! [they've entered the town and Cartman begins to sing.]

Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.
With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.
What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me
I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.
Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.



-----


Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's recovery room. Cartman's mom sits by his bed as Stan and Kyle look on. Dr. Doctor enters.

Liane

[jumps up worried] Is he going to be all right, doctor??

Dr. Doctor

Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.

Liane

[quickly returns to embrace him, with emotion in her voice.] Oh baby baby, you can't die.

Kyle

Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! [shakes him hard]

Liane

Whoa. Easy, Kyle.

Kyle

But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!

Stan

I guess we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!

Liane

I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!

-----


Flashback, night. The driver and Cartman approach Jefferson's house.

Official messenger boy

Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.

Cartman

Super neato! [both driver and Cartman disboard and walk towards the door]

Official messenger boy

[stops and turns] I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.

Cartman

But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.

Official messenger boy

Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson

Cartman

Oh, okay.I guess I understand. [the driver walks off. Cartman notices some firewood and picks up a log of it, then follows the driver while singing to himself]

I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...[he quickly assaults the driver and beats him with the log, then drags the body away and returns to the Jefferson residence, knocking on the door]
I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...



Jefferson

Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.

Cartman

And I am the official messenger boy, I am.

Jefferson

[holding a document] Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress. [hands it to Cartman]

Cartman

[beholding it] Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.

Jefferson

Some favor going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.

Cartman

It's a bitch, ain't it?

Jefferson

Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger! [Cartman turns and heads for the carriage] Now make haste!

-----


Stan's house, day. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny study at the coffee table in the living room.

Stan

Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-

Protesters

[first heard, then seen as they enter from screen left] No war! No war! No war!

Kyle

Oh, Jesus...

Randy

Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.

Stan

Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.

Mr. Mackey

Hey... That's a terrific idea!

Gerald

Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!

Stan

Oh, no, nononono.

Supporters

[first heard, then they enter through the front door] Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops!

Skeeter

See? I told you they had your son.

Stuart

Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!

Kenny

(I'm doing my homework.)

Randy

The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! [the war supporters clamor against Randy]

Stan

Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-

Stuart

Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country! [grabs Kenny's jacket] Come on, Kenny!

Kenny

(But Dad, I-)

Stuart

NOW!

Skeeter

Yeah!

Supporters

Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! [they walk out the front door. Kenny follows his dad out. Stan follows him ]

Stan

[stops at the open door] Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww. [turns around and returns to the table] Awww, now we lost two in our study group!

Kyle

[shoves his book off the table] God damnit!

Randy

Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.

Gerald

Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!

Protester 1

Yeah, that's right!

Protester 2

Come on, guys!

Protester 3

Get back to work!

Kyle

Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?

-----


Philadelphia, day. Independence Hall is shown. Cartman enters and finds the Congress room. The doors open before him.

A voice

Enter, young messenger. [Cartman enters the room, awed by the people he sees around him, and approaches the main desk. He hands the document to the man waiting there] I am John Hancock, President of the Congress.

Cartman

Wow.

Hancock

Mr. John Adams?

Adams

Aye. [rises and approaches the table]

Hancock

Will you do the honors of reading the document to Congress, please? [Cartman takes an empty chair nearby]

Adams

[reading from the Declaration] WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one Penis to rise up- [cut to the end of the Declaration] -we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.P.S. - Every Thursday should be Free Ice Cream Day. [rolls up the Declaration. Cartman looks around]

A Congressman

Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England?

Adams

We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson. [chatter erupts]

-----


South Park, day. The town square stage. On stage are decorations for the two sides. On the left is a large peace sign on a green curtain surrounded by peace signs and protest signs, on the right is a large eagle surrounded by yellow ribbons. Both groups are on stage.

Mr. Mackey

All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? [people within the crowd clap. Randy comes out dressed in an Elvis outfit].

Skeeter

Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! [raises a fist. Other people within the crowd clap]

Mr. Mackey

And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.

Skeeter

Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!

Jimbo

Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!

Mayor McDaniels

[intervenes] People, I told you, you have to share the stage.

Randy

Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!

Skeeter

Well excuse me if... I'm a little bit country.

Randy

Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!

Skeeter

I'm a little for supportin' our troops.

Randy

And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.

Skeeter

I believe freedom isn't free.

Randy

No, but war shouldn't be our goal.

Skeeter

We must defend our country.

Randy

If it means war, then we say NO!

Somebody

Yeehaw!

Skeeter

[walks to the edge of the stage in front of the war support crowd, then sits on the edge]

Did you forget them towers in New York?
Did you forget how it made you feel
To see them towers come down?
Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?



Randy


I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq!
The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!



Skeeter


We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead.
We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.



Randy


Why are we fightin' this war?
There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.
They didn't give me a choice.
War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!



-----


Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument going on.

Adams

We must go to war!

Dickinson

But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.

Congressman 1

England will only understand one thing: Force.

Congressman 2

[rises] I must state again for the record that South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia are against war! [pounds the table with his fist]

Congressman 3

Yeah, because you don't care about the fate of the Colonies like we do! You're all unpatriotic! And if you don't like the Colonies, then you can get out!

Dickinson

Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want! [the various Congressmen begin babbling with each other]

Cartman

[observing] Whoa, how very very relevant.

-----


South Park, day, town square. The rally is still going on, and a reporter files the following report.

Tom

Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.

Mr. Mackey

And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. [Stan walks up to the mic, watching the crowd on the way there. Kyle follows. The crowd claps appreciatively]

Protesters

Booooo!!

Randy

[steps up] For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. [shows them off and backs out of the scene. The crowd applauds and quiets down]

Stan

Uh, we didn't do it.

Mr. Mackey

What?

Kyle

We didn't do our homework.

Sharon

Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!

Stan

Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Daylight Savings and we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-

Skeeter

That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!

Mr. Mackey

The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!

Supporters

Support!

Protesters

Protest!

Supporters

Country!

Protesters

Rock-n-roll!

-----


The two sides charge at each other on stage, then off stage. They attack each other with their signs. One man drives his "War is not my voice" sign straight down into another man's head. A man drives his "Bush is a Nazi" sign up a woman's nose after she swats him with her "Support Your Troops" sign. A woman strikes someone else down with her "No Blood for Oil" sign. Stan and Kyle just look on.

-----


Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument still going on.

Congressmen

Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!

Dickinson

We cannot found a country based on war!

Adams

We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!

Congressman

Rabble!

Congressmen

Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble! [the doors open and in walks an august figure. The boisterous voices become hushed] Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. [they keep murmuring this as Franklin walks towards the main desk]

Cartman

Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.

Hancock

Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?

Franklin

I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?

Jefferson

Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time.

Dickinson

Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.

Franklin

And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless.

Adams

[holding a slice of chocolate cake] It's like having your cake, and eating it, too.

Congressman 2

Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another.

Hancock

And we will call that country the United States of America.

Cartman

Wow, I get it now! I get it! [senses his flashback coming to an end] Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.

-----


Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's room. Cartman comes to and looks around.

Cartman

Wow!

-----


South Park, town square. The townsfolk are still attacking each other and killing more of their number. One man kills another with a "PEACE NOW" sign. A war supporter runs a flag pole through a protester, then pulls it back out again. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny watch from the other end of the square, towards the stage as the carnage continues.

Cartman

[appears on stage in his hospital gown, his hair disheveled] Everyone, stop! Please! [everyone stops and looks at him]

Townsman

The-the child! The child, from the hospital.

Cartman

If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.

Stan

He does? [he and Kyle are shocked]

Kyle

He does?

Cartman

I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to. [a shot of the crowd] 

Cartman

You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."

Randy

He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.

Skeeter

Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.

Gerald

And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.

Mr. Mackey

I guess we... owe you an apology.

Stuart

Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.

Townsfolk

Awww. [amid a chorus of awwws they hug each other.]

Kyle

Cartman? Cartman saved the day?

Stan

Can't be

Cartman

The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.

Skeeter

Hey I'm a little bit country

Randy

And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!

-----


Cartman takes his mic and backs out of the scene, leaving Randy and Skeeter to sing together.

Skeeter

I'll be the muscle of America

Randy

And me, I'll be the caring soul.

Together


And when you put us together you get a nation with one goal
To thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll.



Skeeter

Come on up here, everybody! [the crowd surges onto the stage. Stan and Kyle look dumbfounded]

Everybody

We're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll

Stuart

We can be a nation that believes in war.

Mr. Mackey

And still tells the world that we don't.
[moments later the back of the stage begins to rise, revealing guests from many previous episodes]


Everybody


Let the flag for hypocrisy fly high from every pole
Cuz we're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll.



Randy

Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.

Skeeter

We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people. [shown, including Halfy. Some applause is heard] And the anti-war people. [shown. Some applause is heard]

Stan

What the hell are they doing now?

Kyle

[covers his nose and shuts his eyes tight] I-I don't know.

Everybody

For the war, against, the war, WHO CARES?? One hundred episodes!

Randy and Skeeter perform some nifty footwork as they finish the song.

Kyle

I hate this town. I-I really really do.
