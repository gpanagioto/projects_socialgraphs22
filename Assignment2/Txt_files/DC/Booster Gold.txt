==Publication history==
[[File:Dan Jurgens by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Dan Jurgens, the creator of Booster Gold.]]
Booster Gold first appeared in ''Booster Gold'' #1 (February 1986),<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|editor-last = Dolan|editor-first = Hannah|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 218 |quote = The DC Universe gained one of its most peculiar stars in the first issue of writer/artist Dan Jurgens' ''Booster Gold'' series.}}</ref> being the first significant new character introduced into [[DC Universe]] continuity after ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. The next year, he began to appear regularly in the ''Justice League'' series remaining a team member until the group disbanded in 1996. He and his former Leaguers subsequently appeared as the "Superbuddies" in the ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' miniseries and its ''JLA: Classified'' sequel "I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League".

At [[Wizard World]] Los Angeles in March 2007, [[Dan DiDio]] announced a new ongoing series titled ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|All-New Booster Gold]]'', which was later published as simply ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|Booster Gold]]''. The series follows the events of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' and was initially co-written by [[Geoff Johns]] and Jeff Katz, with art by creator Jurgens and [[Norm Rapmund]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DC Nation Panel from WW:LA|work=[[Newsarama]]|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423|first=Albert|last=Ching|date=March 16, 2007|access-date=2007-03-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320015505/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423|archive-date=March 20, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Geoff Johns Shares Booster Gold Thoughts|work=Newsarama|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105430|date=March 16, 2007|access-date=2007-03-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130831/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105430|archive-date=September 29, 2007}}</ref> The series focuses primarily on Booster Gold's clandestine [[time travel]] within the [[DC Universe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classic.newsarama.com/dcnew/Booster/booster.html|title=Johns, Katz, and Jurgens Talk Booster Gold |work=Newsarama |date=March 21, 2007 |access-date=2007-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328171407/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Booster/booster.html |archive-date=28 March 2007}}</ref> The series also features [[Rip Hunter]], Skeets, and Booster's ancestors Daniel Carter and Rose Levin as supporting characters.

Jurgens and Rapmund stayed. Jurgens assumed writing duties following four issues by guests [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[Rick Remender]].

In May 2010, [[Keith Giffen]] took over the ''Booster Gold'' title, linking it with the 26-week miniseries ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', in which Booster united with [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] and [[Captain Atom]] to defeat the resurrected [[Maxwell Lord]]. From July 2010 through February 2011, Booster starred alongside Rip Hunter, [[Green Lantern]], and [[Superman]] in the six-issue miniseries ''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'', part of the "[[The Return of Bruce Wayne|Return of Bruce Wayne]]" arc, which also reintroduced the [[Reverse-Flash]] and established the background for the 2011 DC crossover event ''[[Flash: Flashpoint|Flashpoint]]''.<ref name="tmvpflashpoint">{{cite web|first=Russ|last=Burlingame|work=Comic Related|title=Time Masters: ''Vanishing Point'' #6 and ''Flashpoint'' Exclusive News!|url=http://comicrelated.com/news/10599/flashpoint-exclusive|date=February 3, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206002643/http://comicrelated.com/news/10599/flashpoint-exclusive|archive-date=February 6, 2011}}</ref> Jurgens returned to the main ''Booster Gold'' title with issue #44.<ref name="tmvpflashpoint"/>

===Development===
Jurgens's 1984 series proposal for Booster Gold compared the hero to U.S. Olympic Gold athletes such as [[Dorothy Hamill]], [[Peggy Fleming]], and [[Caitlyn Jenner]], who had turned "Olympic gold into commercial gold", selling multiple products based on their fame and past accomplishments.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Jurgens|first=Dan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1107062655|title=Booster Gold: The Big Fall|date=2019|publisher=|others=Mike De Carlo, Gene D'Angelo, Nansi Hoolahan, Tom Ziuko, Agustin Mas, John Costanza|isbn=978-1-77950-075-5|location=Burbank, CA|pages=|oclc=1107062655}}</ref> Booster's origin as a security guard at a future [[Superman]] museum was altered when writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] was brought to DC to reboot Superman's origin in ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]''.<ref name=":0" />

===Legacy===
Since his origin, other characters within the DC Universe have hinted that there is a greater purpose to Booster Gold than he knows.

During the ''Millennium'' event, [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] reveals to Martian Manhunter that Booster is descended from the Chosen and that he must be protected. It is revealed that Booster is destined to come to the past to protect him from an unknown event in the future.<ref name="bg25">''Booster Gold'' #25 (February 1988). DC Comics.</ref> In [[52 (comics)]], Rip states that the moment Booster helped save the multiverse from Mister Mind would be remembered in the future as the start of Gold's "glory years."<ref name="52w52">''52'' Week 52 (May 2, 2007). DC Comics.</ref> Later, in the new ''Booster Gold'' series, Rip hints at a "Carter heroic legacy."<ref name="BGv2 6">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #6 (March 2008). DC Comics.</ref> It is then revealed that Booster is important to the Time Masters, as he will train "the greatest of them all",<ref name="BGv2 10">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #10 (July 2008). DC Comics.</ref> being the father and the teacher of Rip Hunter himself, who willingly chose to protect his identity against other time-travelers, to pass through history as the only loser of the clan. Despite the general distrust of Booster, Rip and his descendants apparently know the truth, always honoring him.<ref name="bg1000000">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #1000000 (September 2008)</ref>

Due to the complicated Time-Travel mechanics, Booster's future self, "currently" operating from an unknown era with his time-travel educated wife, still watches over his past self and his son, making sure that Rip Hunter gives his past self proper schooling. The older Booster acts in total anonymity, and has access to other "time-lost" equipment than his suit, such as [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]'s seemingly-destroyed "super-goggles".<ref name="BGv2 30">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #30 (March 2010). DC Comics.</ref>

Due to a [[predestination paradox]], the future Booster is revealed to be a more experienced Time Master than his son Rip Hunter, but also that he personally tasked Rip to school his past self. It is also implied that the departure of the Hypertime concept, rather than a simple [[retcon]], is Booster's work, as in the future he tasked himself with the role of pruning divergent timelines from each universe in the Multiverse.<ref name="BGv2 30"/>

==Fictional character biography==
===From the future===
Michael Jon Carter was born poor in 25th-century [[Gotham City]]. He and younger twin sister Michelle never knew their father because he left after gambling away all their money. Michael was a gifted athlete, attending Gotham University on a [[American football|football]] [[athletic scholarship|scholarship]]. At Gotham U., Michael was a star [[quarterback]] until his father reentered his life and convinced him to deliberately lose games for gambling purposes. He was exposed, disgraced and expelled. Later he was able to secure a job as a night watchman at the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] [[Space Museum (comics)|Space Museum]], where he studied displays about superheroes and villains from the past, particularly the 20th century.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=52}}</ref>

Michael's [[sidekick]] is a robot named Skeets. Skeets is a 25th-century security robot (sometimes "valet unit") with [[Artificial intelligence in fiction|artificial intelligence]]. He is capable of flight, cognition, and voice projection, which are all considered highly advanced for 21st century Earth. He also has historical records which give him a vast knowledge of what will happen between the 21st and 25th centuries, though its reliability has become questionable. He possesses numerous miniature tools and weapons kept within his shell, and is also equipped with a powerful energy blaster. He is apparently immune to reality and temporal manipulation.

With the help of Skeets, Michael stole devices from the museum displays, including a [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] flight ring and [[Brainiac 5]]'s force field belt. He used [[Rip Hunter]]'s Time Sphere, also on display in the museum, to travel to the 20th century, intent on becoming a superhero and forming a corporation based around himself to make a comfortable living.<ref name="dc-ency"/> He is a shameless self-promoter whose obsession with fame and wealth irritates other heroes.<ref name="bg1">''Booster Gold'' #1 (February 1986). DC Comics.</ref>

Carter's nickname as a football player was "Booster", but his chosen 20th century superhero name was "Goldstar". After saving the president, Carter mangled the two names, causing [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] to introduce him as "Booster Gold".<ref name="bg8-9">''Booster Gold'' #8-9 (September–October 1986). DC Comics.</ref> The name stuck. In a running joke throughout the DC Universe, people erroneously call him "Buster" to his chagrin.

===Celebrity===
Booster is originally based in Superman's home city, Metropolis. He starts his hero career by preventing the shapeshifting assassin Chiller, an operative of [[100 (DC Comics)|The 1000]], from killing the [[President of the United States]] and replacing him. With the subsequent public exposure, Booster signs a multitude of commercial and movie deals. During his career, his sister Michelle Carter, powered by a magnetic suit, follows in his footsteps as the superheroine [[Michelle Carter (comics)|Goldstar]]. Booster is devastated when she dies battling creatures from another dimension. Amassing a small fortune, Booster founds Goldstar, Inc. (later Booster Gold International) as a holding company and hires Dirk Davis to act as his agent. During the ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' event, Davis reveals that he is a [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunter]] in disguise and that he siphoned money from Booster's accounts in hopes of leaving him no choice but to do the Manhunters' bidding. Although the Manhunters are ultimately defeated, Booster is left bankrupt.

===''Justice League''===
Booster Gold is a key character in the late 1980s/early 1990s ''[[Justice League]]'' revamp by writers [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]. Booster Gold is frequently partnered with fellow Justice League member [[Ted Kord|Blue Beetle]], and the two quickly become best friends. The duo's notable appearances include a stint as superhero repo men, and as the minds behind the construction of a gaming resort, Club JLI, on the living island [[Kooey Kooey Kooey]].

After one too many embarrassments and longing for his old reputation, Booster quits the League to found The Conglomerate, a superhero team whose funding is derived from corporate sponsors. Booster and his team are determined to behave as legitimate heroes, but find that their sponsors compromise them far too often.<ref name="dc-ency"/> The Conglomerate reforms several times after Booster rejoins the League, though without much success.

When an alien comes to Earth on a rampage, Booster coins the name [[Doomsday (DC Comics)|Doomsday]] for it. While battling the entity, Booster's costume is destroyed. Blue Beetle is able to design a new, bulkier costume to replace it, although this costume often malfunctions. During a later battle with Devastator, a servant of the [[Overmaster]], Booster is nearly killed and loses an arm. Again, Blue Beetle comes to his aid, designing a suit that acts as a [[life support]] system in addition to replicating the powers of Booster's previous costumes. This suit also includes a cybernetic prosthetic for his lost arm.

===''Extreme Justice''===
After the Justice League falls apart, Booster Gold joins [[Extreme Justice]], a team led by [[Captain Atom]].<ref name="dc-extr">{{Cite book|last=Beatty|first=Scott|author-link=Scott Beatty|contribution=Extreme Justice|editor-last=Dougall|editor-first=Alastair|title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page=117|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc=213309017}}</ref> While a member of this team, Booster makes a deal with the supervillain [[Hank Hall|Monarch]], who fully heals Booster's wounds so that he can once again remove his battle suit. Booster dons a new costume created by Blue Beetle. Skeets acts as its systems controller, who aids Booster and is able to take control of the costume if Booster is rendered unconscious.

Following the disbanding of Extreme Justice, this suit is destroyed. A new costume is created by [[Professor Hamilton]], based on the designs of both the original 25th century costume and the energy containment suit Superman was wearing at this time. This costume is apparently later tweaked to resemble Booster's original costume more closely.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===''Countdown to Infinite Crisis'': ''The OMAC Project''===
After the events depicted in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', in which [[Sue Dibny]] is murdered, Gold retires briefly, but then helps Blue Beetle discover who is manipulating KORD Industries.<ref name="countdown">''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' #1 (May 2005). DC Comics.</ref> Booster is badly injured in an explosion at Kord's home, and it is revealed that his companion Skeets has been dismantled for its 25th century technology by the [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization.

In ''[[The OMAC Project]]'' limited series, Booster Gold gathers the old [[Justice League International]] heroes to investigate Blue Beetle's disappearance. At the series' end, he is ruined physically and emotionally, having destroyed much of his gear in the fight against the [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]]. He has seen his friend [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]] die in battle. He discovered that another friend, [[Maxwell Lord]], is responsible for killing Blue Beetle and that in fact, Lord always hated metahumans and superheroes. In a moment of self-reflection, he realizes that if only he had bothered to recall more of what was history in his native era, he might have been able to warn his friends. Giving a farewell kiss to the forehead of his wounded teammate Fire as she lay in a hospital bed, he drops his trademark goggles on the floor and leaves, saying only that he has decided to "go home", implying a return to the 25th century.<ref name="omac">''[[The OMAC Project]]'' #1-6 (June–November 2005). DC Comics.</ref>

===''Infinite Crisis''===
In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Gold resurfaces in the ruins of the [[Justice League Watchtower]] on the moon, along with Skeets, again branded as a criminal in his time for "hijacking historical records".<ref name="ic2">''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #2 (January 2006). DC Comics.</ref> When Skeets fails to locate the absent [[Martian Manhunter]], Booster searches for [[Jaime Reyes]], the new Blue Beetle, whom he promptly takes to the [[Batcave]].

===''52'' and Supernova===
{{Main|52 (comics)}}
In the aftermath of ''Infinite Crisis'', Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman temporarily retire their costumed identities, and the remaining heroes attend a memorial for [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] in Metropolis.<ref name="52w1">''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 1 (May 10, 2006).

===One Year Later===
{{Main|Booster Gold (comic book)}}
Following the events of ''52'', Booster Gold returns in his second solo series with the first story arc "52 Pick-Up". Booster puts in a request to the Justice League that they admit him and the group begrudgingly decide to monitor him over the following week. However, Rip Hunter informs Booster that history has become malleable after Mister Mind's rampage and [[Retcon punch|earlier damage to the timeline]].

===''Blackest Night''===
{{main|Blackest Night}}
In a tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Booster faces Ted Kord, reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]. At first unavailable due to reliving Ted's funeral in the past, he returns to meet his ancestor Daniel Carter, only to find the crashed, derelict Bug at his house. Then, he finds the Black Lantern pummeling Jaime Reyes, Daniel, and Skeets.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #26 (November 2009). DC Comics.</ref> Attacked by him, he removes Daniel and Rose from the scene and heads to Kord Industries to arm himself. He uses a special light gun designed by Ted to blast the corpse and separate the ring with light, simulating the emotional spectrum.

Upon separating the corpse from the ring, he collects Ted's remains before the ring can reanimate them and takes them into the Time Sphere to Vanishing Point Fortress to secure them. He is somewhat relieved when Skeets uses the Fortress's special chronal surveillance equipment to display images of the days of Team Blue and Gold. Jaime promises to live up to Kord's legacy and eventually form a new Blue and Gold team. They find evidence at the warehouse of someone else entering, even though the doors were genetically coded, with only two people cleared for access: Ted and Booster.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #27 (December 2009). DC Comics.</ref>

===''Brightest Day''===
{{main|Brightest Day}}
Booster next finds his sister living in Coast City mere hours before its destruction. Though unable to save her boyfriend, Booster and Michelle patch up their relationship, with her agreeing not to leave him. This arc introduces an older Booster Gold, the man that trained Rip Hunter and was the master of both Time, the [[Multiverse]], and [[Hypertime]]. Rip reveals that this Booster is not only his father, but also has been watching Rip training the young Booster Gold, aiding him when needed. Older Booster also reveals that he is still married to Rip's mother, and that Michelle is with them in some unknown time.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #31 (April 2010). DC Comics.</ref>

In ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', Booster is part of the manhunt to bring the resurrected Maxwell Lord to justice. He finds Max but is beaten badly. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom find him just as Lord uses his psychic powers to the utmost to erase all memory of himself from the minds of the entire world. For some reason, Booster, Fire, Ice, and Atom are the only ones who remember Lord and see him in recorded images.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1 (Early July 2010). DC Comics.</ref> Trying to convince Batman ([[Dick Grayson]]), Booster is horrified to learn that, thanks to Max, the world believes Ted Kord committed suicide. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom are soon set up by Max to cut them off from allies, but, ironically, Booster is left alone because his reputation is already poor.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (Late July 2010). DC Comics.</ref>

===''Flashpoint''===
{{main|Flashpoint (comics)}}
After the ''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' event, Rip Hunter informed them that someone snuck into the JLI base, leaving messages on a chalkboard about the altered timeline.<ref>''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' #6 (February 2011). DC Comics.</ref> When Earth entered an alternate timeline due to the actions of the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], Booster and Skeets awaken and are the only ones who remember the original timeline (later, Booster realizes that the chronal protection in his suit saved him from being erased). Gold travels to [[Coast City]], but US soldiers attack him mistaking him to be an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] threat. Skeets is damaged when Gold is attacked by the military's Project Six, which is revealed to be Doomsday.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #44 (May 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

During the battle in Coast City, he discovers that Doomsday is controlled by General [[Captain Atom|Nathaniel Adam]]. He escapes from Doomsday and then saves a woman named Alexandra Gianopoulos from Doomsday's attack. He learns the timeline has been changed, suspecting [[Professor Zoom]]. Alexandra and Booster split up, but she secretly has powers allowing her to take others' powers and follows him. Later, he flies to Gotham City when Doomsday attacks him. General Adam's control link is destroyed by Alexandra in an attempt to rescue Booster. Doomsday's true personality comes to the surface and he attacks Booster.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #45 (June 2011). DC Comics.</ref> During the fight, Doomsday beats him nearly to death, but he is rescued by Alexandra. He tries to prevent Doomsday from killing innocent people, and manages to put Doomsday's helmet back on. Doomsday's control is restored to Adam, who grabs Booster, hoping to kill him.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #46 (July 2011). DC Comics.</ref> Fortunately, Adam takes him back to the base for interrogation, allowing him to escape when the sight of "Project Superman" causes Doomsday's true personality to resurface. Alexandra defeats Doomsday by using the control helmet to make Doomsday tear himself apart, subsequently asking Booster to take her with him when he restores history to normal. Alexandra subsequently sacrifices herself to save Booster from an Atlantean attack, leaving him to return to Vanishing Point as history resets without any clear memory of his time in the "Flashpoint" universe. Before the ''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' event, Alexandra somehow appeared in the JLI base and left the messages regarding the altered timeline on the chalkboard before vanishing.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #47 (August 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

===''The New 52''===
{{main|The New 52}}
In ''[[The New 52]]'', Booster Gold appears as part of the new ''Justice League International'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/08/26/lemire-robinson-and-azzarello-%E2%80%93-dc-bullet-points-from-fan-expo-canada/ | title=Lemire, Robinson And Azzarello – DC Bullet Points From Fan Expo Canada | work=Bleeding Cool | access-date=2011-09-08}}</ref> In the Post-''Flashpoint'' continuity, Booster is portrayed with his original glory-seeking personality and is chosen by the U.N. to lead the JLI due to his PR sense and naiveté. He takes his leadership role seriously, and strives to become a better hero and role model.<ref>''Justice League International'' vol. 3 #1 (September 2011). DC Comics.</ref> However, despite his best efforts and support from Batman, who officially defers to Booster's leadership after supporting Booster for leader, the JLI falls apart due to a string of attacks against the group that leaves members killed or wounded.<ref>''Justice League International'' vol. 3 #7-12. DC Comics.</ref> Despite his best attempts to bring in new members, Booster later watches in horror as the hero OMAC betrays the team and inflicts more carnage, including teleporting Blue Beetle to the homeworld of the villainous "Reach" species.

In the end, Gold is confronted with what appears to be an older version of him, an agent of [[A.R.G.U.S.]] who warns his present self to prevent Superman and Wonder Woman from dating. Failure to prevent it, without explanation, would cause Booster Gold to cease existing. As the JLI monitor reveals Superman and Wonder Woman kissing, the future Gold disappears. The present day Gold disappears moments later.<ref>''Justice League International'' vol. 3 Annual #1. DC Comics.</ref> A.R.G.U.S.' director [[Amanda Waller]] orders [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]] to search for the contemporary Gold through time, but Chronos is captured by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] before carrying out his mission.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #5 (June 2013). DC Comics.</ref> The older Booster Gold mysteriously reappears in other timelines, like 19th century Gotham City.<ref>''All-Star Western'' #19 (April 2013). DC Comics.</ref> In ''Booster Gold: Futures End'' #1, the older Booster clarifies he is not an older version of the ''New 52'' Booster, but an older ''version'' of him from a universe which has ceased to exist. The older Booster is sent careening through the timeline, eventually meeting up with his sister, Goldstar, who is in a version of Metropolis which has been sealed in a bubble by a godlike version of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] from an alternative universe. They are teleported to where the younger, New 52 Booster is held captive by Brainiac. Brainiac threatens to kill Michelle unless the younger Booster gives up the location of Vanishing Point, which he concedes. The older Booster knows this could lead to the end of the Multiverse, setting up the events of ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]''.

In the two-part ''Convergence: Booster Gold'', Booster is found by a Pre-''Flashpoint'' Rip Hunter on [[Skartaris]], where the older Booster Gold and Goldstar are in prison on the planet Telos, where Brainiac has gathered cities from across the history of the Multiverse. The ''New 52'' Booster and Rip release them both. Hunter tells older Gold that he has not traveled through the timeline, but through the cities in the planet which were now chronal anomalies that he was in conflict with, and that his body absorbed so much time travel radiation that he was aging rapidly and dying. The aged Pre-''Flashpoint'' Booster transports again, and encounters the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' Ted Kord. Booster explains to Kord that he has led a good life, married and had a son. Rip, the ''New 52'' Booster and Michelle find him, and Rip forces the ''New 52'' Booster to take his father into the raw chronal field contained at Vanishing Point to cure him; Pre-''Flashpoint'' Booster's body is destroyed, but he is reborn as [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]], the all-knowing cosmic time traveler. Waverider then emerges on Telos in the final issue of ''Convergence'', along with the ''New 52'' Booster and Goldstar to bring back Brainiac, and they convince him to save the Multiverse from its imminent destruction. Brainiac then sends the ''Zero Hour'' [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] and Pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman back to the conclusion of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' to avert the original crisis event, and this results in many of the classic worlds of the Multiverse being reborn in their modern forms.

Alternate versions of Booster Gold and Blue Beetle as they were prior to ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' appear in the pages of ''[[Justice League 3000]]'' #14, where they are awaken from a 1,000-year suspended animation on Takron-Galtos in the 31st century. According to Keith Giffen, "they're [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and ''my'' Blue Beetle and Booster Gold".<ref>{{cite web|title=BLUE BEETLE & BOOSTER Are Back ...

===''DC Rebirth''===
{{main|DC Rebirth}}
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called "[[DC Rebirth]]", which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to "The New 52". Booster Gold and his robot partner Skeets return in ''Action Comics'' #992.<ref>''Action Comics'' #992 (November 2017). DC Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
As the series ''Booster Gold'' features time travel as a major plot element, Booster regularly visits alternate timelines where key events in history played differently. Occasionally, in ''Booster Gold'', and in ''Justice League International'', alternate versions of Booster from these timelines make appearances.

In ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League'',<ref>''JLA Classified'' #8 (August 2005). DC Comics.</ref> several "Super Buddies" visit an alternate universe where Maxwell Lord leads a violent super-team of [[Striptease|stripper]]s and male enforcers called the "Power Posse". An apparently unpowered and street-talking Gold serves as an employee. He is much more brutish, [[wikt:pimp slap|pimp slap]]ping a female employee simply because Lord commands it. This alternate version of JLI may be the same team as the [[Qward|Antimatter Universe]]-based [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate of Amerika]], which first appeared in ''Justice League Quarterly'' #8 (1992) sans Booster Gold,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blaklion.best.vwh.net/timeline3.html | title=Earth-3 Timeline | work=Blaklion.best.vwh.net | access-date=2011-01-15 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127075451/http://blaklion.best.vwh.net/timeline3.html | archive-date=2011-01-27}}</ref> but many of the events in this series do not seem to tie directly into continuity.

===''Elseworlds''===
In ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'', the sequel to the [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' ''[[Elseworlds]]'' series, Booster is the founder and owner of the Planet Krypton restaurant. He is also mentioned in ''Kingdom Come'' by Fire.

In ''[[Justice Riders]]'', a western take on the Justice League by [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[J. H. Williams III]], Booster is a travelling gambler who wants to join Sheriff [[Wonder Woman|Diana Prince]]'s posse. To counter the speed advantage of Prince's preferred choice, [[Wally West|Wallace "Kid Flash" West]], he acquires a machine gun from the eccentric inventor Ted Kord. At the end of the story, once the Justice Riders have defeated Maxwell Lord, Gold heads for Denver, where "the suckers come in by the trainload every day".

===''Justice League 3000''===
In the continuity of ''[[Justice League 3000]]'', Ted and Booster have slept for 1,000 years in suspended animation tubes. They wake up on Earth, now the prison world of Takron Galtos, where they are immediately taken advantage of.

===''DC One Million''===
The ''[[DC One Million]]'' version of Booster Gold is a time traveler named Peter Platinum ("Platinum always beats gold") who appears in ''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #1,000,000. Based on Booster's reputation as a profiteer posing as a hero, Platinum admits to Booster that he is pulling the same scam, but more successfully, and assumes Booster is after a cut. His superhero gear is based on technology stolen from Rip Hunter, who has apparently had several encounters with him to get it back.

===''52'' Multiverse===
In the final issue of DC Comics' 2006–2007 year-long weekly series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', it was revealed that a "Multiverse" system of 52 parallel universes, with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as "New Earth"), had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce [[:Category:Alternative versions of comics characters|alternate versions of fictional characters]], hypothesize "What if?" scenarios, revisit popular ''Elseworlds'' stories, and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity.

The 2007–2008 weekly series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' and its spin-offs would either directly show or insinuate the existence of alternate versions of Booster Gold in the Multiverse. For example, ''Countdown'' #16 introduced his evil [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]] counterpart, a member of the villainous [[Crime Syndicate of America#Crime Society of America|Crime Society of America]] — and a similar Booster Gold exists on the Antimatter Universe, as suggested in a 1992 ''Justice League'' comic book,<ref>''Justice League Quarterly'' #8 (Summer 1992). DC Comics.</ref> with Booster's evil variant first appearing in a 2005 ''Super Buddies'' story. The 2007 ''Countdown'' spin-off series ''Countdown Presents: [[Atom (Ray Palmer)#Identity Crisis and Countdown|The Search for Ray Palmer]]'' also featured a gender-reversed Earth-11 where, through character exposition, it is revealed that Maxine Lord (the female Maxwell Lord) murdered this world's female Booster Gold as opposed to its Ted Kord counterpart. The 1997 [[Tangent Comics]] [[fifth-week event]] (Jurgens) originally introduced an entirely different version of Booster Gold, a yacht-owning gentleman connected to the origins of the mysterious [[Green Lantern]]; when the Tangent Comics universe was later amalgamated into Earth-9 of the ''52'' multiverse, 2008's ''Tangent: Superman's Reign'' #1 (again by Jurgens) introduced an African American superhero by that name.

===''Injustice 2''===
Booster Gold and Skeets appeared in the prequel to the sequel game ''[[Injustice 2]]''. He and Ted Kord, the Blue Beetle, had been friendly rivals even though Booster used to mock Ted's Blue Beetle suit due to his weight. One year after Superman's Regime has ended, Michael warns Ted about the latter's cruel fate in the future, something Michael cannot prevent and is not allowed to interfere with. Before he sets on his way home back to the future with Skeets, Michael bids his friend farewell and promises that they will see each other at the end. After Ted is mortally wounded by Orca and Killer Croc, Michael arrives to talk to Ted one last time. Ted tells Michael to look after Jaime Reyes before his final breath.<ref>''Injustice 2'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a training session with Jaime, Booster receives a message from Ted, telling him he now owns Kord Industries and his suit.<ref>''Injustice 2'' #41. DC Comics.</ref>

===''Smallville''===
Booster Gold is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].

===''Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century''===
Another incarnation of Booster Gold appears in ''[[Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century]]'' #19. The series is based upon the [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|television series of the same name]].
