 Did it work? I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass. Pssst! Pass this up. Kyle, could you turn around for a second? Thank you.  Come on, Wendy. Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"? Then come on! Who wants to go first?  Okay.  Okay.  Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!  Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare? Stan, Truth or Dare? Kyle, can I talk to you? Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart. I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency. No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way. Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never. Okay, Clyde, we can go now. Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare? Take this stick and jam it up your peehole. Do you think it'll hurt?
