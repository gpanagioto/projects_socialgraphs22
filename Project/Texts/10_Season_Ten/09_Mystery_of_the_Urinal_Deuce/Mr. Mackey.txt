 And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?! Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here! But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.  Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that! More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you! No, I'm not saying they're related! Oh no, not the Goddamned- Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! Huh? Why, Clyde? Why did you do it? You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room.  M'kay, that's good!  Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal! Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay?  When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!
