Kill John Lennon...  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?  Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians. Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding. I am? Oh no. Which book was that? I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read ''The Catcher In The Rye'' I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep! Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did. Huh?  Oh, thanks. I wrote that.  Thank you!  That's nice.  Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric? But, you told me I did! Yeah, I'm broooding. No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading ''The Catcher in the Rye'', I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener! I have to come right to my room after school. Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly. Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so. Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan. Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit. Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind! Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver! Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation.  I know.  You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And now she's gone and it's because of me! Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get through this. What? What?! Oh no! Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly.
