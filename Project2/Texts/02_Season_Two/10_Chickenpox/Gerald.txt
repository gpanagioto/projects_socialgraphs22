Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were. Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have ''you'' got a lot to learn! Sit down, son. You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods. Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down. ''That's'' right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America. Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh... Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best? Right. Right-right. Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries. Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard? Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha-- Oh, right. Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along. Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky. Hey! I worked my ''ass'' off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody! You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father! Ow!!  Ow! You son of a bitch! Ow! Ow!  Huuuh! That son of a bitch ripped my parka! I just don't get it. Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard? What? Now why the hell would you ''knowingly'' deceive me like that? Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either! What?! Oh, God, what have I done? Are you doing okay? And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
