That's how I feel when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, so she can't hurt me anymore.   Shut up, Mom! Go away! Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!  God, she just ''never stops''! What?! Shut up, Mom! Are we really doing this again?! What?! I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff! Noo...  I'm not going to any fucking camp! I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!! Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  Hey guys.  What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me.  I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all ''die''. Not now Mom! I'm suicidal! Oh, hey.  What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap. That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?  You should probably stop digging for answers. There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time. Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late. Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?  Join us! Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert? Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in.  Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  So, my friends. Have you made the transformation? Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily. Oh my Gawd...  This is so... embarrassing. Oh.  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks, you guys. Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
