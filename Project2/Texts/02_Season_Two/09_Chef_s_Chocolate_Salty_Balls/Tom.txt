I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens,  and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities. Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage. Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon. I ate all mine up, silly. Ooh, good idea. Let's.
