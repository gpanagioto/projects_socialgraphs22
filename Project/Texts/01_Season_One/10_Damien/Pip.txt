Oh, Eric. I didn't ''get'' an invitation. Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me. Right-o.  Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday. Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it. Good day, Damien. How are you? Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call ''me'' that anymore. Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there. Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on ''me''. Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but- Aaaa! Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.
