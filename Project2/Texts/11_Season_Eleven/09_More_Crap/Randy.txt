 Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?! P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff. How painful is "painful"? Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon? Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what? Come on! That's pretty impressive!   Look what your old man made. Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first. Well ''he's'' gotta see this.  No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying! Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard.  Hey guys! Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.  Well I don't know about ever...  I guess it was pretty big.  It wasn't bigger than mine was.  Mine... mine was bigger.  You wanna see it? Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.  That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?   Aw crap! The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.  Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning. Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.  Courics... But that means... Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!  You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!  Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.  What? Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.  Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!  I would need a lot of help. I say...  YYEEAAHHHH! Oooooo. Can I, can I see it? Ahhh... In Zurich?  I can't do it! I can't do it! But then, does it still count?  No... Nooo... I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon?  I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono. Oh God, here it comes!  Yeah, I'm...  Feel a lot better.
