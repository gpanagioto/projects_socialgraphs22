Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert! Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no. What is that supposed to mean? Yes, Freemium gaming. I ''love'' Candy Crush. Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up. And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person? You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow. If she means that much to you. How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little. Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work. No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live. Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that! No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models. Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you. Fuck you!  They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong. Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something. Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!   Sorry folks, just one second here. Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo!  Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about? I was told to! Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him!  Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing? Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be- This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth. Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth.  I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do. Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of. I'll do no such thing! You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content? Sharon? Sharon! They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us! The hologram's in our bedroom? You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
