Butters' home, night. Butters enters the living room with a wrapped gift in hand. He walks up to his parents. His mom is polishing an end table while his father reads the newspaper on the sofa beside it.

Butters

Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.

Chris

Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon? [chuckles]

Linda

[puts her hands on her hips] Oh, you!

Chris

Just kidding. [lowers the newspaper and takes the gift from Butters and shakes it] Oh, I wonder what it is.

Butters

It's a- [covers his mouth for a second, then looks down] Awww, shucks, [looks at his dad] I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.

Chris

Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!

Butters

Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it?? [starts running around the coffee table in excitement] Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! [stops and bounces with excitement]

Linda

Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.

Butters

Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!

A montage of Butter's previous appearances in South Park fills the screen. Then the picture of Butters with a Barbie doll grows to fill the screen. Then as this chorus is song, the following scenes appear: Butters at Picture Day - a lock of hair pops straight up as his picture is taken. He tries out for Fingerbang. He turns around and is about to show his "fruit bowl." He puts on a condom. He's with Tolkien and Timmy at the drugstore. He says a few lines in the "Helen Keller! The Musical" play. He gets his hair cut at the David Blaine complex. He's with his fellow Angels, then slides down a rope and bumps into Mr. Garrison, then hops off.

Choir

Turn a frown into a smile for free?

Everyone knows it's Butters!

[Butters, with pic of himself and John Elway, corrects the choir: "Elway!"]
Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples,
Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?
If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find
A little boy named Butters!



Butters

[In the splash screen, the hole he was in is gone] That's me, [brings his fists together twice.] Yeah. [walks off to his left].

+++++


Return to Butters' living room. His mom is dusting off a portrait on the wall as his dad returns to reading the newspaper

Butters

[making calculations on a sheet of paper at the coffee table] Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.

Chris

[rises and walks over to Mom] Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. [hugs her gently]Linda: I hope he means me, haha. [Dad turns and walks to the door.]Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.

Chris

[at the front door] I'll be back in a little bit. [Butters rises to see him off] Butters, you're in charge of the house.

Butters

[salutes] Yes sir! [Dad exits and closes the door. Butters moves back to the table.]

Linda

[walking towards the door] Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?

Butters

We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.

Linda

[walks around Butters to the other end of the coffee table] Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short. [walks away towards the camera and stops, wondering] I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.

Butters

Dad's a good shopper all right.

Linda

[kneels beside Butters] Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.

Butters

You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?

Linda

[rises and goes to the computer] No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? [takes a badge from the desk and shows it to Butters.]

Butters

Sure I do!

Linda

Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing. [hands the badge to Butters, who puts it on] What do you say?

Butters

[salutes her] Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! [walks away]

South Park, night, the seedy side of town. Butter's father walks down the street and stops at a corner. He sees a pawn shop across the street and walks towards it. He turns and looks around the street, then puts on a hat and turns up the collar on his shirt. He walks back the way he came. Butters has arrived and sees him from behind a bush across the street. Butters has on his own disguise - a handlebar mustache - and carries a note pad, on which he takes notes of his father's every move. He pops out from behind the bush. His father looks around to make sure no one is following and arrives at Studcat Theater to see "Fisting Firemen 9." He looks around as he enters, and the doors close behind him

Butters

[takes down the info he sees] Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.

+++++


Butters' father soon leaves the theater and walks towards a men's bath house, the White Swallow Spa. He arrives and rings the doorbell. He looks around both ways and enters as soon as the buzzer sounds. Butters looks on from behind a trash can across the street

Butters

[writes down] "White Swallow Bath House"

Butters' house, night. He's returned from his tour of espionage and finds his mother in the kitchen cutting carrots into slices

Butters

I'm back, Ma!

Linda

Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?

Butters

I sure did. [walks over to the breakfast table and takes a seat] Dad sure had a nice night out.

Linda

Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?

Butters

Well first, he went to see a movie.

Linda

A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.

Butters

I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat. [Mom freezes] I didn't know it was open. [a look of dread is on her face]

Linda

Wait a minute. What was the movie called?

Butters

"Fisting Firemen 9" [her dread turns to shock] I've never seen 1 through 8.

Linda

Oh my God...

Butters

Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.

Linda

Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?

Butters

To the gym.

Linda

To the gym?

Butters

Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.

Linda

[stung by that revelation] Gaah!

Butters

Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!

Linda

[really shocked] ...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!

Butters

Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures. [holds them up for his mom to see. She walks over and takes them from him. She sees her husband gong into the theater, then into the spa, then being rammed by a man from behind...] The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'. [his mom faints right to the floor] Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?

Butters' house, day. He's working with Lego blocks at the coffee table while his mom works on the wall behind him, painting over one shade of green with a lighter shade. Her hair is a mess.

Linda

[in a fractured, disturbed voice] Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint.

Chris

Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.

Linda

Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!

Chris

[approaches Butters] Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?

Butters

Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.

Chris

Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. [walks towards the front door.]

Linda

[paints furiously now] Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.

Chris

[opens the door] I'll be back in a little while. [exits]

Butters

[walks over to the door] Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?

Linda

I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again. [rolls some paint on him downwards] Paaiint. [rolls some paint on him upwards] Paaiint. [turns around and walks away, leaving a confused Butters behind] Must be made clean. New.

Butters

Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. [opens the door and exits.]

Linda

[alone with her thoughts in front of a family photo] Must clean Butters. [paints over her face] Clean. Never be clean. Must... [paints over Butters' face] kill? The only way? Must kill Butters. [paints some more over their faces] Paaiint.

The White Swallow Spa, night. Butters is at its front doors and rings the buzzer. The doors open and he enters He jumps up and gives the attendant some money - $10.

Butters

One please.

Attendant

Locker two thirteen! [a towel pops out through a dispenser next to the window]

Butters

Uh thanks! [takes the towel and heads for the spa's locker room.]

+++++


The locker room. The camera pans across the locker room and shows nothing but men in towels. Some of them are exercising, others just chat.

Butters

[appears in the doorway] Dad? [walks in] Dad, you in here?

+++++


A hallway. Butters happens upon a wooden door with a small window in the upper half. He looks up at the window, then enters the room.

Butters

Hello? Eh-anybody in here?

Man

[voice only] There, do you think that works?

Mr. Garrison

[voice only] Well, that's four fingers; try five.

Butters

Uh, Mr. Garrison?

Mr. Garrison

...Who is that?!

+++++


The main hallway. Butters enters and checks the first door to his left. Two men walk towards the entrance and walk out

Butters

[reaches the second door to his left, which is ajar] Da-ad? Da-ad?? [pushes the door open] Are you wrestlin' in here? [gets a better look: two men are engaged in anal intercourse] Dad?

Mr. Slave

This room's taken.

Butters

Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs. [exits and closes that door, then moves to the opposite room and looks in] Dad? No. [leaves that room and moves to the third door to his right] Hm. [opens the door: his father is masturbating, but Butters doesn't know what that is.]

Chris

[sees his son at the door and quickly covers himself] OOH! BUTTERS!

Butters

Hi Dad! [waves and smiles]

Chris

[now with towel in hand] Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!

Butters

I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?

Chris

[quite embarrassed, has the towel in position] Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.

Butters

Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. [backs out and closes the door]

Chris

[now distraught] Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?

Butters' house, night. Butters' dad is in his study.

Chris

[closes a book, rises and calls out] Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?

Butters

[appears in the doorway] Uh, hey Dad.

Chris

Come here, son. [taps his lap. Butters enters and approaches] I wanna have a talk with you.

Butters

[hops onto his father's lap] Well, sure thing, Dad.

Chris

Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.

Butters

Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.

Chris

Yes, it sure can be. [pause] But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies."

Butters

Little white lies?

Chris

You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.

Butters

...Uh, who's Jack?

Chris

Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.

Butters

Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.

Chris

It won't? Oh, good.

Butters

Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.

Chris

You... what?

Linda

[In the doorway] Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.

Butters

A drive? Oh, boy! [puts his fists together twice] I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?

Linda

No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.

Butters

[hops off his dad's lap] Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad. [walks out after his mother] Oh boy, a drive!

+++++


Boat dock, night, some minutes later. Mom drives onto a boat ramp and edges close to the water. A song plays on the radio: "Jingle Bell Rock." She slows the car to a stop.

Butters

Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.

Linda

[with a blank expression on her face] Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?

Butters

Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.

Linda

And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.

Butters

Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.

Linda

If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.

Butters

Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere? [begins searching] It's cold out here.

Linda

I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters. [Butters looks up at her] I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.

Butters

Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then. [she moves the gear shift to neutral, releases the emergency brake, opens the driver-side door, and exits. She walks away from the water, and the car starts to move forward] You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom. [cut to a view of the water from the dock] Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.

Linda

[close up. Her hands are together, fingertips touching] Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.

Butters

[a view of the dock from the water] Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water! [she turns away as the car leaves the dock] Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! [she walks away]

Butters' house, night, living room. His mom has returned home and is now writing a note. A noose hangs over the coffee table, ready for her to use when the time comes. His father, apparently, is not home

Linda

"Dear bastard husband," No. [scribbles over the words, then writes] "Dear lying sonofabitch," No. [scribbles over the words, then writes] "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"

Chris

[enters the front door and quickly grasps the situation] Linda?? What are you doing?? [moves behind the sofa and to the lamp. Linda rises and quickly moves to the noose, then puts it on defiantly]

Linda

Stay away from me, bastard!

Chris

Linda, I know this is very hard-

Linda

[snaps back] You don't know anything!

Chris

I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!

Linda

[sobbing] Then why, Chris, why?!

Chris

It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!

Linda

Well, [glares at him] you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! [turns away and sobs]

Chris

No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you. [she removes the noose and falls to the floor] We can have a normal life!

Linda

There is no going back, Chris!

Chris

Sure there is!

Linda

No! [turns to face him] Our son is dead!

Chris

What?

Linda

[sobbing] I killed him. [collects her thoughts] I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!

Chris

Oh no. [Linda cries loudly] No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?

Linda

[snaps] I WASN'T THINKING! [catches her breath] I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you! [points at him, then breaks down] Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- [dissolves into sobs]

Chris

[confused] This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.

Linda

Just go away and let me die! [sobs]

Chris

[genuflects next to her] No! Linda, we-

Linda

I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! [lays down on the floor face first and pounds it with her right fist]

Chris

Linda, Butters is gone. [drops into thought] Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! [she start weeping, then he starts, and they both weep...]

+++++


A river, day. The family car come into view, floating down the river, with Butters still strapped in.

Butters

Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now. [the car floats down some more and crashes into some boulders. The passenger-side door flies open] Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt. [unfastens it and lets it go. He scrambles out and over the boulders] Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home. [before him are some low hills and the Rockies in the background. No buildings in sight] Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?

News 4 Reporter

Tom, I'm standing in front of the home of Chris and Linda Stotch. They're living every parent's nightmare right now, as last night, while Ms. Stotch was driving with her son in the car, a man stopped her, put a gun to her head, and took her son away. When asked who the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, "some Puerto Rican guy." Naturally, the police are in an all-out manhunt for some Puerto Rican guy. [the front door behind him opens and the Stotches appear] Uh, it looks like the parents are about to make a statement, Tom. [cameras start snapping pictures. Officer Barbrady and fellow police officers form a barricade to keep the crowd away from the podium.]

Reporter 1

Mrs. Stotch? Mrs. Stotch? Any word yet from the man who took your son?

Linda

No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.

News 4 Reporter

Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper look like?

Linda

Puerto Rican.

Reporter 2

Was he tall? Short?

Linda

He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.

Truck driver

Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause I need some God-damned poontang.

Butters

Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now. [dream sequence: the doors open and the family walks in] We'll walk in the front doors, [a smiling waitress welcomes them and leads them to their booth] and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth [Butters focuses on the booth bench, runs to it, and climbs on] Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.

Butters' house, day. The news crews and the crowd are gone. Inside, the parents sit on the sofa as the police and detectives handle the case. The phone rings. Chris rises, but the police chief stops him

Butters

Uh, is this the Stotch residence?

Barbrady

Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?

Butters

...No.

Barbrady

Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?

Butters

[looks down and checks himself out] ...No.

Barbrady

We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day. [hangs up and faces the family and officers] It wasn't the abductors, sorry.

Officer 1

[enters the front door] Chief! Two more parents from the next town over have shown up saying their child might have been killed by the same guy that took the Stotch boy.

Police chief

Really?

Officer 2

[enters with the couple] This is John and Patsy Ramsey, from Boulder.

John Ramsey

Our daughter was killed a few years ago, in our house.

Linda

Yes, I... remember hearing something about that.

A and we realized... The man that murdered your son must be the same person that killed our daughter!

Yes, because we certainly didn't do it! No. [they both laugh nervously]

No.

A road, day. Butters walks along and comes to a fork in the road. A gas station sits in the middle of the fork, and a mechanic works on a red car. Butters approaches him

Butters

Sir? Hello?

Mechanic

[leaves the car to see Butters] Hallo, what can I do for ya?

Butters

Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.

Mechanic

Sarrih, wife took the car to Estes Park for the weekend. Won't be back until Sunday, hyeah. I can give you a ride Sunday, if ya like.

Butters

I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.

Mechanic

Well, then, looks like you're walkin'.

Butters

Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? [points to the road on the left]

Mechanic

'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod. [the camera pans to the right and stops at a terrifying road. It is lined with spooky trees with faces on them, dark threatening clouds overhead, and eerie sounds.] 'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod.

Butters

[unsure, blinks] ...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow, [starts walking] and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.

Mechanic

Well, uh good luck then.

Butters

Oh jeez. [he enters the gloomy forest]

It's so very hard to lose a loved one, isn't it?

Chris

Yes, it, it sure is.

Patsy Ramsey

Thank goodness we have each other to share our grief.

Linda

Thank goodness.

John Ramsey

[points towards the entrance] Here he is. [a door is heard opening and in walks...]

A Politician

John! Patsy!

John Ramsey

Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit. [Condit approaches the table, waves hello, and takes a seat next to Linda] He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids.

Gary Condit

We're goin' tuh get that sonofabitch! [grins. That grin is fixed in place]

Chris

Yes, I'd I sure hope we do.

Gary Condit

I spoke with the FBI and some Puerto Rican guy has just made their Number One Most Wanted, heh.

Patsy Ramsey

Oh, good. Maybe now they'll catch him. [the door is heard opening again] Oh, here's another member of our support group. [waves hello] O.J.

O.J. Simpson

[waves] Hey guys.

Gary Condit

Chris, Linda, you know O.J. Simpson. [O.J. walks up and shakes Linda's hand]

Linda

Oh. Sure.

Patsy Ramsey

O.J.'s wife was killed by an uh, some Puerto Rican guy, too.

O.J. Simpson

Yup, it was some Puerto Rican guy all right.

John Ramsey

So you see, Chris and Linda, there are people like you all over the country who've been affected by some Puerto Rican guy.

Gary Condit

Hey! Let's make Chris and Linda an official part of the group.

John Ramsey

Yeah!

Patsy Ramsey

Yeah!

O.J. Simpson

Alright!

Patsy Ramsey

[waves her knife like a conductor's baton] One of us! One of us!

Gary Condit

Gooble gobble gooble gobble!

O.J. Simpson

The Ramseys and Condit

O.J. Simpson

The Ramseys, O.J., Condit

Gooble gobble! Gooble gobble! One of us! One of us! [the Stotches look at the other four in fear]

The scary road, night. The skies have cleared to reveal a bright full moon. The camera moves down to the road and Butters comes into view singing to himself

Butters


For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
[a shadow flies over the trees in front of him, and an eerie cry is heard. He stops]
Buffalo wings and fried cheese sticks, the best are found at... Bennigan's
[a snarling sound is heard. He stops and turns right, looking into the trees]
Uhuh, hello?
[after a while of looking, he turns left and starts walking again]
So come and eat at...



A voice

[whispering] Why can't he see us?

Butters


...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
[the eerie sound is heard again, and three red dots are aimed at his forehead - he has been targeted by someone, or something... He turns right again and looks into the trees. Someone looks back, and turns on thermal vision. A neon view of Butters is shown. Butters turns left and start walking again. The three dots remain trained on his forehead]
Oh, nutsack [moves his hands to his mouth and gasps a bit] Oops.

Butters' house, day, the anniversary has arrived. Inside, Chris and Linda are fighting over the details of the unfolding story of Butters' disappearance. He sits on the sofa; she's pacing the floor, crying, and both are unkempt

Chris

Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican! [rises] You have to learn to keep it straight!

Linda

I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!

Chris

Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! [the door opens and Butters walks in]

Linda

Don't forget: your lies started all this. [Butters closes the door]

Chris

My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! [Butters approaches and looks]

Butters

Happy Anniversary!

Chris

Not now, Butters!

Butters

Oh. [moves off to his left] Alright, then. I-

Linda

Butters?? [spots him and scoops him up, then shares him with Chris]Oh, Butters!

Chris

Son! I don't believe it! [they both drop on one knee as they hold on to Butters]

Butters

Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-

Linda

Oh, my baby's back!

Butters

I ain't grounded, am I?

Chris

No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why... [relief fades to spin] Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?

Butters

Lie?

Linda

Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.

Chris

No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! [both parents set Butters down and rise]

Linda

Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!

Butters

Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.

Chris

[over Butters' voice] Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!

Linda

You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!

Butters

Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.

Chris

Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!

Butters

Now gosh darn it, you! [steps in between his parents] You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble! [Chris and Linda listen] Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here [puts his right hand to his chin, palm down] with you two! [a few seconds of silence follow]

Chris

...Butters... You're as right as rain.

Linda

[genuflects and messes with Butters' hair] You sure are.

Butters

Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?

Linda

No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world. [Chris walks over to the phone as Linda and Butters look at each other] And I am so happy you're alive.

Butters

...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?

Chris

You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing...]

Butters' house, day. The news media and the spectators are back at the Stotch house for another press conference.. The front door opens and the Stotches step forth to the podium, all cleaned up and well-dressed. Cameramen begin taking pictures

Chris

We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. [Butters comes out of the house to stand next to his parents, and cheers are heard in the crowd. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are present]

Man in crowd

Wow, alright.

Stan

Butters was missing?

Chris

But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.

Butters

[points at the crowd] Yeah!

Linda

We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.

Butters

Yeah! [a shot of the Ramseys, O.J., and Condit]

Chris

You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.

Butters

[raises both arms in victory] Ye-! [turns to look at his father, and his arms go down] wait, what?

Cartman

Huho!

Linda

[Butters is now afraid of what she might say] And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.

Butters

Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!

Stan

Damn, dude.

Chris

So you see, there was no "some Puerto Rican guy." He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a LIAR!" [points at the crowd, and Condit's fixed-grin face is shown] "You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!" [back to Chris] Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, "Hello," but they'd be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!" [a shot of O.J.] "You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!" [back to Chris] And to me, people might say things like, [a shot of Condit] "LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!" [back to Chris] And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like, [a shot of the Ramseys] "You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!" [a shot of O.J.] "CONFESS!" [a shot of Condit] "LIAR! CONFESS!" [back to Chris] You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.

Linda

We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.

Chris

And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.

Man 2 in Crowd

Yeah-ah-alright! [the parents go back in the house as a stunned Butters stands on the walkway. The crowd disperses and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk up to Butters]

Stan

Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.

Butters

Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.

Cartman

We sure are.

Butters

I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.

Stan

Really?

Butters

Naw, I'm lyin'

Chris

[appears in the doorway] Let's go, son.

Butters

Wuh comin', Dad! [goes inside the house]

Everyone knows it's Butters!
