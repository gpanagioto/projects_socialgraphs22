Think about what? Dude, nobody cares about a stupid bike parade. "Wassup" is I thought we agreed bike parades are stupid. Me too. We could totally own the bike parade.  Yeah, and we gotta order some badass spokes and those wheel bumpers! Anything? Did you get anything? Maybe if we reorder everything and have it shipped to a different fulfillment center- No! I refuse to believe we have no other options. Um, what...? What did we do before Amazon? I mean, before we could get whatever we wanted, where did we get stuff? There's gotta be somebody. Uh, hello? We came because... we need... stuff. What?? No!  No, no, look. We need very specific stuff. There's a big bike parade on Saturday.  Yeah. Uh, color-coded specific shoes in four specific sizes. What? H-Hold on a minute. You all stay here 'cause you want to work? Wait a minute. You guys... I think I have an idea. Uh yeah, hi. We ordered a bunch of stuff and we haven't gotten it. No, that's actually why we're calling. We know a whole bunch of people who can come work for you. What fools will pay? Yeah, but listen: we want our stuff! We ordered a bunch of shit for the bike parade, and if we get you workers, we want them to deliver our stuff first!
