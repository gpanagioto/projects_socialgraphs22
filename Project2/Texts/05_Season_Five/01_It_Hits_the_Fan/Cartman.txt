 You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!! I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial. So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, ''Cop Drama''. No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television. You'll never guess. Guess. You ready?  "Shit." It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude. Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it. Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television! Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina? Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?! I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene. Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome! Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch? Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.  Huh? I don't get it. Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word! Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina. Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob.  You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob.   Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob. Kyle, do you ''still'' have sand in your vagina about us not going to ''The Lion King'' with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.  thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick. You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina. So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb.  Oh-Ho, gross! Kenny's got it. heh heh.  Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me! But... we ''can'' keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right? I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob ''is'' a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do! My house, too?  What a stupid voice.  Hah, I love you guys.
