Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real. Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones?  I thought we were getting Playstation 4's. Right. Let's all get PS4s.  That's exactly how XBox people are! We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you! Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us!  Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well. They're still undecided. We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.
