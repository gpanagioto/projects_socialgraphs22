 Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened. Oh, now why would he do that? What ''is'' the picture of, Eric?  Ohh, that's nice. Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen. It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother. Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother. Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth. Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine. You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture. She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it. She said she was sure, Eric. Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
