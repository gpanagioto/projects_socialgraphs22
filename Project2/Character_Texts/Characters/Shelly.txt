Are you looking at my headgear? Are you looking at my headgear? You little liar. I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan! Who said that? Are you staring at my neck-brace? You'll never be bigger than me Stan. Never! What the hell do ''you'' want? Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now. It's not Stan's fault. It wasn't Stan, he was... he was with me the whole time. 
I will. That show's for babies, it's so stupid. Jesus! What the hell are you doing? No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?! You little jerk! You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom! 
 Oh, whoo-peee! Shut up, brat!  Stop it!  Serves you right, you little brat! If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!  We're watching this! Give me the remote! 
Thank you, Aunt Flo. Okay. 
Ew! You're gonna get it now. Ooooo, Stan's in trouble! 
Okay. I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time. Bears? Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when ''I'm'' babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?! My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!   Figure it out, turd! ...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w- ...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night- Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie.  I placed his underwear over his head. Well, ''I'm'' watching ''Friends'', turd!   Hey, Skyler. He's my boyfriend!  He's 22!  You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz! Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments  No, Skyler. Quit it. Eight days tomorrow. I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all. Well, maybe just one kiss. Go on, Astroturd! Turd Rock From the Sun! We left you some crusts!  Guess again, Richard the Turd! You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.  Skyler, not here.  Really? Wow! O Skyler, I love you.  What the-?  Give me that picture! Open this door, Turdledove! Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you.   Give me that picture, turd!  Who is that?! Skyler, your band can't practice here. Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy.   Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident! We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back. Not really. She's dead.  Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead! HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!  Honestly? I think you guys need some work. I just think your sound is kind of... last week. Well, I ''do'' have a song I wrote. Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed! ''In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!'' We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd! Wha-? What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?! What?! No you don't! ...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us. But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on! Shut up, turd! What are you doing? Go away, turd! No. NO!  No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you! 'Cause I'm twelve!  No! What?? But I thought you liked me.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so ''stupid.'' Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly. You don't think so? You're right! He ''is'' a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how. Huh? Really? You would do that? This won't take me long! I'm almost done.  They're having a cat orgy! Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted! Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends. No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here. Wow, she passed out. Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay. 
Geez, what's up Dad's ass? Mom, what's up Dad's ass? 
Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.  Let me hit him, Mom! 
Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy. The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!  That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time! No, turds! Shut up, fat turd!! We're not watching this!   There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!  All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it! And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds!  I told you I needed tampons, '''tuurrddsss'''! 
Shut up, turd! We're watching ''Friends''! I said shut up, turd! I wanna watch TV. My brother is a stupid turd. Me neither. 
 
Oh, you stupid turd! 
Shut up, turd! I'm watching television! I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!  Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you? Oh, you are such stupid turds. Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job. Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return. Shut up, turd!  You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did! You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd.  
Oh my God, it's John Travolta!  
Praise Christ. 
What's going on dad? 
Gross, Dad, sick!  
Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana! Why do you hate me?!  Dad, the Internet's not working! I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts! What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  Amiiir... I miss you so much... What number are you, turd?  You're nine twenty three now. Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in ''this'' stupid family!  This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?! Gggggyyaaah!  It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now!  What? O... kay.  Yeah, okay. Sounds good.  We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther! 
Turn it off, Dad!  
What's going on, Dad?   It's gonna kill us! Mom, I can't see. What is that? What is that?  Oh my Gohhhd! 
Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef.  
Do something, you stupid vegan! Go! Go!  Not the vegans! Yes. Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself.  Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school.  What do you want, Larry?  What do you want, Larry?  Hey!  And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements. Dad, what are you doing here? 
 Finally.  I don't wanna go in there. Six.  God I hate this family!  I can't find it, Somebody took it!  
BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!! 
Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!  Don't limit me! You don't even understand me! 
Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour! 
Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the ''Women of Rock'' concert! Can I go with them?!  But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever!  She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself! That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything! So can I go or not?! Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys.  
What are you talking about? 
God I hate this family!  Why are you always taking Stan's side?! You're always acting like Stan can't do anything wrong!  You shut up or I swear to God I'll use this!  You don't even try to know me, Dad! Okay, maybe I need to stop being so angry! Oooo-kay!  
No I'm not excited! It sucks, Dad! This country is gonna suck for four years! Dad, what the hell is wrong with y-  
I don't give a shit about Columbus. 
I hate marijuana. 
What do you want? I hate marijuana! It stinks, and it makes everyone in this town dumber than they already are! Yes, everyone knows Snoop Dogg is a stupid pothead! Serena Williams No she's not! Everyone in this country is getting dumber, and I wish Marijuana was illegal again! Is this why you brought me here? You said you wanted a special day with just your daughter. You said a father-daughter day at the museum could help us connect. I don't care if Egyptians used stupid pot!  Furniture polish, paint thinner and bleach.<br>Ammonia and antifreeze. One tablespoon each.<br>I hate everybody, I just like to read.<br>Everyone's stupid. They smoke too much weed.<br>So with this eldritch potion and these ancient words<br>I make my revenge upon all the turds.<br> That's what I think of your stupid special!  Dad, you have to drive me to the book fair. Mom said you have to drive me because she's taking Stan trick-or-treating. Yes. Yes!  You're my dad, drive me to the book fair! The last thing people in this town need is more marijuana!  You're such a piece of shit, Dad! Will you SHUT UP? Probably not.  
Do you promise? Is it possible he could get out of it? Egh!  Okay, Mom. You too. I love lasagnaaa.  The season is over? 
 We're going back to school!
