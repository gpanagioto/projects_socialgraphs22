Oh, hey fellas! What are you guys doing? Well, sure! Whatcha lookin' for?  I've got strawberry, vanilla, tropical passion... Tropical passion. It's like mango and kiwi. Yeah, and at five bucks a pop, we're gonna be rich! Oof.   Why'd you punch me, Eric?! I thought we were partners! You punched me in the face! Well what's that supposed to mean?! Well, I don't know how this means you can go and punch me in the face- Hi, Kyle! You know they took away their nap time. Yeah, I wish I had a little pick-me-up! Somethin' fresh and fruity to go with my lunch!   'Cause Eric told them! Please, Kyle! We still gotta pay people off! Run! Wow! You're so smart to think of a siphon, Kyle! Does this mean we're out of the vaping business, fellas?
