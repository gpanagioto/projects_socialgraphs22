Hey fellas. What's happenin'? Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you? I think I'd make a really ''good'' ninja.  I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person- Hi Mom.   Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while. Well, o- okay Mom.  Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me! Nuh uh! Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat! Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped! It hurts! It hurts!    Hwaaaaa! You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital!  Whoa, I'm getting woozy.  But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.  Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy. Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.  Wuhuff, woof, woof. bu- but fellas, I gotta-  Hello? Anybody-eh.   Woof woof.  Gaaaah!
