 Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl? It's cool, Baby. Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl. Hey you guys? Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny. You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby. Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember? Remember, you were like "Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?" in uh, what was it?  Remember, you- it was like uh- 	Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-? Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody-  Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...  It's awesome. You're doing awesome. We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are. Terraform Mars. It was a great idea.  Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark? What? Heidi!  Don't say that. Because you're smart and funny, that's why. It was a great idea, Heidi.  I think that somehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone even realizes. People of Denmark, we know that you've been the victim of trolling. So have we. Maybe we can help. I'm not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... She's really smart and really funny.  You are, babe. Stop it.  Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them.
