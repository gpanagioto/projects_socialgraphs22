You guys look pretty gay.  Not as gay as us, though. Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay! Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags!  HA! Told you you guys were straight! I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite.   Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend! Take your non-flaming ass to some other school!  Everyone knows it's true! Is so!  Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.
