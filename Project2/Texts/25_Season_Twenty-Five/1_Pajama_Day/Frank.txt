Hey, guys– I just wanna say I'm really proud to be a part of this office. Wearing our pajamas shows that we care about those school kids– that we care about other people. South Park Realtors!  What's going on, Mike? You're not wearing... pajamas. We're all wearing pajamas. We aren't telling you to wear pajamas– ''he walks over and opens the door]'' But I'm pretty sure this sign right here on the door says you have to wear pajamas! It's opposite day? Well, shit, we gotta go put some normal clothes on! Because we are people who believe very strongly in wearing pajamas to the workplace. If we're wearing pajamas on opposite day, that means we don't normally wear pajamas and we're douchebags like Mike!
