Are they ever gonna say "shit?" Where are you going, Kyle? But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it! Oh. I can't believe they actually said it.  Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?! Me neither. This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore. What's meecrob? What? What's that? What's the Black Death, Chef? Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here.  ''Word'' of curse? Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death. Holy shit! Uh oh. Now what are we gonna do, Chef? Oh shit!

And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English. Yeah! And Kenny didn't die! Holy shi-  poop.
