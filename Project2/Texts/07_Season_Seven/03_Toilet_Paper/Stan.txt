Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads. See? Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool! Like what?  Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, art-whore! D'you think that's enough? Okay Is this the right house? Kyle, we all agreed to do this! Let's go, Kyle!  Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together. We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up. Yes, dude! Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody. What about him? Butters.  So what should we do?  ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle! Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright? Cartman, what are you doing? You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed! They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station. We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true? Butters? He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it. It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess. Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.   Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final. You, you do? How? Wugh! Two weeks of this!
