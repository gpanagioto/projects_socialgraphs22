We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now. Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out. It is, but we can't let them kill themselves. Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs.  We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.  Look. You see this? You see this? You see it? You see it? Go get it.  Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass! Look out!  Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command!  Alright everyone, fire!  Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation.  Woops. You're right. Quick, let's get out of here!
