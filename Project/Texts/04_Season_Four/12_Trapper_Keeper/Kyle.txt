Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten. Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.  and it's all covered with pictures from ''Dawson's Creek''. Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me! He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius! He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought-- Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!  You are? I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass! No, I don't! I don't care! Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out! I'm gonna! I will!  Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different. Whoa, dude..! Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast. That should do it. Cartman, you dumbass! You can't ''get'' a new one! Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass! Hey! What are you doing? Oh... Okay. Yeah, that'd be faster. Here we go again.  Dammit, Cartman, open up! Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down. Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it! You ba--!  Why is ''that'' bad? Step on it, Bill Cosby!  Not-- Aw, damnit..!  I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU. Screw you, fat ass! Cartman!  No! I can't reach the CPU. Got 'em!
