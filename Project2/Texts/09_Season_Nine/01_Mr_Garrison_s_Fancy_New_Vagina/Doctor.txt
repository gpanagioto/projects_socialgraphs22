Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber. I'll be performing your surgery today. ...an abortion? Mmister Garrison- Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion. No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pregnant. You can't have periods either.  You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs. N-that's right. Basically, yes.
