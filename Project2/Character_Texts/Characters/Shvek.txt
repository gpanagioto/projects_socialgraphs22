My name is Shvek. You are safe. My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546. You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years.  We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii. Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii. Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first. You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason. You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist. What in Science's name was that?!  Oh Science, help us!  The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them.  Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  
No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great.  Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!  What are you otters doing?! This is our attack! Unified Atheist League is the most logical name. So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.  All right, Eric. Are you all set to go? Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time. We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled. We explained that to you already.
