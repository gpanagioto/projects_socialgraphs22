==Publication history==
Jackhammer was first mentioned as a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] leader in ''Daredevil'' #121; he first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #123 (July 1975) and was created by [[Tony Isabella]] and [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]].

==Fictional character biography==
Jackhammer is a costumed agent/division leader of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] when it was under the leadership of the crime lord [[Silvermane]]. When they arranged a kidnapping of [[Foggy Nelson]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] pursued them. Jackhammer was among those who fought Daredevil and was defeated.<ref>''Daredevil'' #123</ref>

Jackhammer later left HYDRA and gained superhuman strength from a treatment at [[Power Broker (character)|Power Broker]], Inc. and started a relationship with female wrestler [[Poundcakes]] whose rebuff threatened the first date of [[Captain America]] and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]]. [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]] and [[Asp (comics)|Asp]] rendered Jackhammer and Poundcake unconscious.<ref>''Captain America'' #371</ref>

Dr. [[Karl Malus]] of Power Broker, Inc. formed Power Tools with Jackhammer and other villains in their plot to capture [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]] and other characters when they de-powered them. He was among the villains that fought Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #374-378</ref>

Jackhammer left Power Tools once when there was an occasion that [[Doctor Octopus]] recruited him to join his incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] during the ''[[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]''. He was among the villains that turned on Doctor Octopus causing him to take flight.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #28-29</ref>

He would participate in an attack on the Thames Tunnel, threatening many civilians inside. He was swiftly defeated by the superhero [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]].<ref>''Union Jack'' #1-2 (November–December 2006)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Jackhammer is an accomplished [[engineer]] and inventor, who wears devices similar to the [[Shocker (character)|Shocker]]'s vibro-shock gauntlets. They increase the concussive force of his blows by generating pulsed [[Vibration|vibrations]] on contact.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol 2 #6 (May 1986)</ref> Now, he received immense physical attributes due to the Power Broker treatment, but it somewhat diminished his mind.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol 1 #373 (July 1990)</ref>
