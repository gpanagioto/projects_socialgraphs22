Hey, fatass. Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe. What are these? They're Chinpokomon! Yeah, like ancient history. No, dude! Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective. The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.  Ogh..! Yeah, get with the times, dude.  Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller? Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!  How's it goin', fat ass? What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp? We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure.  Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp. You didn't know that? Dude, did you just say "a-ight"? Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore. Can you see anything?  It's starting, it's starting! Juuhachi desu ka?  ''Juuhachi'' is eighteen, Garrison-san. He said, "Garrison-san sabuchii da naa." Yeah, dude. That was totally gay. Totally gay. Kore wa watashi no uchi desu.  Nan da kore?  What? You like it?  Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something.  Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?  Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore. No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused. ...Ye-eah. Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes. Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards? What the..?
