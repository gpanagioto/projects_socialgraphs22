Wow, really? That's pretty impressive. But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night. I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me. Is that an M&M? Pry his mouth open! What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? Huh? Oh, Red Lobster. Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up? There's nothing here, Kyle.  He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President. Oh my God you guys, look!  Aw shit, it's him again. Well, we tried, dude. Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much? Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer? Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?
