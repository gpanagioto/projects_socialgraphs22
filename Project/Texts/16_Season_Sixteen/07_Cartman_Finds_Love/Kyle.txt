Just tell us, Butters.  Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me! Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right? Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know? Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys! Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya!   You motherfucker!  What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?! The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her! Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage! What? Who is Cupid Me? You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple! Goddamnit!  Hey man. You okay?  What happened? It just didn't work out? So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... It's done?  So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available? Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy? Huh?  Dude, what the fuck? That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Tolkien 'cause he thinks blacks belong together!
