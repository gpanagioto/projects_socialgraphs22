 What were you thinking?! How dare you outright defy me like that! Your brother was being punished for using the computer and you decide to just leave with him? You felt bad for him, after all the horrible things he said to people online?! Your brother is a sick troll, Kyle! You just wait until your father gets home.   Kyle, Ike! What the hell is this?! What did I say?! Get off of that computer riiight ''nooooow!''  Are you serious right now?!  Get off that computerrrr! I don't care, I said no computers! You kids are addicted to the Internet! You're sick, and you're addicted! It's changed your brother, and now it's turning you against me, Kyle! You are! Your father goes away on business and all you do is defy me at every turn! The next time you defy me, it will be your last! Do you understand?! And when your father gets home from Denmark, you two are both going in for counseling. The government sent him over to do paralegal training, so it would've nice if you could've shown a little support!  Yes?  You get back here, you little monster!  Where is he?! Where is your brother?!
