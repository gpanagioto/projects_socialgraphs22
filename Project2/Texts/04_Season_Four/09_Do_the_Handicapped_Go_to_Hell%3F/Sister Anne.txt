Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion. It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works.  No. Yes. In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, "eat this, for it is my body." Nononono! The Body of Christ!  No! Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?! And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ. Eric, do you wanna go to hell?! Then stop questioning me. No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession. You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything.  Oh, hello, children.  Okay, shoot.  The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins. Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest.   I have to ask you a question. Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine. Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to- Yes, but- Father-  Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they ''will'' get into heaven. Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped. Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities. Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?  Handicap. Mental handicap.  ...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true?  Oh no.
