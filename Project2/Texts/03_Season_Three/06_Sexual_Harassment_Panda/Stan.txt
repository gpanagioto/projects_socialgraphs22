Ohh, dude, get me ''out of'' here! You would think that, you little ass-sucker. An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker. What? No you can't, you little ass-sucker! Hoh, whatever!  I called you an ass-sucker! What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time! Wwhat do you mean? Uh... I'm eight? Huh? I have to give him half my stuff? Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy. Uh, no! I hate that toy! Damnit! Where's our desks?  You see, Cartman? You see what this has done? Bad. Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits? Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!  'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please. We want Sexual Harassment Panda. Well, where is he?! What the hell is wrong with these people?!  'Scuse me. Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here. ...Coats? Dude, what the hell is going in?! Well, we don't take kindly to you! Come on, we'd better hurry.   Whoa! Who are you? ...Thanks a lot, dude. Have you seen any panda bears? Oh my God! They killed Kenny! Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick! Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.  Okay, you are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a ''new'' message. A new message that people will find useful again.  No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
