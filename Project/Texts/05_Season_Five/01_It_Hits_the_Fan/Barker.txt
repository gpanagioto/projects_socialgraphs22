Take a free spin. Double your odds.  How can I help you, noble sir? A what? Uh... I can help get you some credit or a comp meal, perhaps. Look kid, This is just a casino. I can't help you. You know, not every British person knows about wizards  and dragons and curses.  The Rune Stone of Gaelic! Where did you get this? The Skire once spoke of such a stone! Come, we must see the sorcerer!  These Americans wish to see the Skire! How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?! Didn't you realize "shit" is a curse word?! Ha! Leave it to Americans to think that "no" means yes, "pissed" means angry, and "curse word" means something other than a word that's ''cursed''!! Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place.
