Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted.   Kyle! What's happened to you?? Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys. Oh, is the game on or something?  Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too??  What's that?  Kyle! You look terrible!  Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look. Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
