It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care. Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see. Come, come, right over here.  Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.
