Oh no, that's fine.  God damn it! There's no such thing as a ManBearPig!  You got that?? We're working with facts here, not goofball theories! Fuck scientists!  Why are you trying to figure out what's going with scientists?! The only thing I want to know is who committed this school shooting, since our school-shooting suspects are in jail! Oh well, there you go! It was them again! Gee, I didn't need any freakin' scientists to figure that out, did I?! Get 'em outta here!  Now how the fuck did those kids break out of my jail?!  You'd better start from the beginning. Oh, you'd better not-  You're playing Red Dead Redemption, aren't you?! What did I tell you about playing on my saved game, Maggie?! What are you talking about?!  You fucking slut! Don't you talk to me like that! Found them where?! Maggie!  Nwaaahahahahaha... Belay those orders!  We're nothing if we don't believe in each other! And Goddamnit, it's never too late to start trying to do the right thing. You think you know what that is, boys?
