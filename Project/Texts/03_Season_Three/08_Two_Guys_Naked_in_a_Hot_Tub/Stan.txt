I don't want to go to this stupid party! No, ''you'' guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels. Awww! I don't ''wanna'' hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody  Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!  No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school! Shut up, Pip. Butters, is there any way out of here? Oh my God. No.  Yes.  Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me. Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!  What?  What do I have to do? Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.  What, Pip? What the hell do you want?! You did?  We're going upstairs. Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs!   Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set. I don't care, just hurry!  Rad!  There are no more missions. I have everything I want.   Just... play something else! God! Whoa, cool!  Dude! That's this house. They think ''our'' parents are the religious cult!   Mom, go look outside. Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves.  We don't have any weapons. Get back inside!   Dad! Dad, they shot at us. Mom!  Get a hold of yourself, man! Come on. We have to find out what's happening.  Sh! We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party. Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real.  Tell them not to burn us down.  Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters. You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job.  Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters? We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there.  Can you hit a target, Pip? Hit something nice and solid now.  Nice job, Pip. Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn.  He made it down.  But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along. You?! You think ''you'' had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins! Super weak.
