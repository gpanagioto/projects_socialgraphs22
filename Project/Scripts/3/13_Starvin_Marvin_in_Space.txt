In Memory of Mary Kay Bergman

-----


Space. A small ship makes its way towards Earth. An alien flies the ship. It has a big brain, and its head is covered with veins that stick out.

Marklar

Marklar, this is Marklar. Approaching Marklar.

Marklar dispatcher

Proceed with marklar and make first contact.

Marklar

Marklar. [the Marklar ship descends to Earth and hovers over a desert. It lands, and the Marklar pilot steps out. It walks forward] Greetings, Marklar, I am Marklar. [Two lions and a lioness look at him hungrily.] I come in marklar. [the lions move towards him] Oh, marklar. [the lions jump him and rips him to shreds] AAAAAAAAAA! [the lions run away carrying chunks of the Marklar in their mouths]

-----


Fade to next day, the Ethiopian desert under the hot sun. The Ethiopians laze about in front of their huts, having nothing to do. The camera pans past the hut to a small white church with a simple cross and a white picket fence.

Woman

Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus. [a group of Ethiopians sit cross-legged, with their Bibles in front of them on white benches. This is her Bible class. Above them, two ceiling fans spin, clanking a little] Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely? [an Ethiopian attempts to eat one, but Hollis interrupts] No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them. [returns to the front] Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19. [the class does not respond] Come on, remember [pulls down a chart]: reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food. [the students study the chart, then open their Bibles] Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? [glissant as the camera switches to Marvin reading. He lowers his Bible]

Marvin

Doundobi godia dyum * *

Hollis

No, Marvin, in God's language. English.

Marvin

Dongdin * * mium bidu [closes his Bible, leaves it, and heads towards the door]

Hollis

Where are you going? Back to your life of sin? Don't you understand that unless you find Christ, you and all your people are doomed to eternal hellfire? [Marvin just opens the door, walks out, and heads towards the desert. He passes his people, who can do nothing but moan]

Ethiopians

Ooooohhh. [some of them cough. Marvin shows surprise as he sees a group of eight people on a hill looking down at a column of smoke. He moves up to them]

Marvin

Duo bet tum debettum * * ghm * *? [the camera goes over the group to reveal the Marklar's ship. Marvin stares in awe] Mah tah guum tyum * * ghm tm tm. [moves towards it. The chief says something, but Marvin continues to the ship. He touches it, and it opens up for him, the sand washing off its surface. The group on the hill screams with joy. Some of the group runs away]

Ethiopian

Necah * * necundat? [Marvin opens the cockpit and hops in]

Chief

Nn * * de co?

Marvin

Umi chu. [presses a button to activate a map display. The cockpit closes and the ship lifts off]

Ethiopian woman

Wobe dabiga gm * *.

Marvin

Gobede *. [presses a button and the ship lurches up. He takes off and comes back, sweeping over the villagers' heads. He takes off into space, into the distance, and then returns. The episode title follows close behind]

-----


Starvin' Marvin in Space

-----


In Star Wars fashion, the camera moves from space down and right to a sunny day in South Park. The camera settles on South Park Elementary as the bell rings. Class is now in session

Mr. Garrison

...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay. [the door opens and two agents enter. They start looking under tables and lifting desks, then lower the blinds...] Uh, can I help you?

Agent 1

Yes. I'm Connelly, and this is Sphinx. We're with the CIA.

Sphinx

We're here to speak with some of your students. [turns to them] You [Cartman], you [Kyle], you [Kenny], and you [Stan].

Mr. Garrison

Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!

Cartman

Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!

Kyle

No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!

Connelly

Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!

Kenny

(Huh?) [Connelly takes Cartman and Kyle, Sphinx takes Kenny and Stan. They then carry the boys out the door. Sphinx reaches back to close it]

Mr. Garrison

I hope you give them the chair! [turns back to the chalkboard] Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. [writes "Hare Krishnas" on the board.]

-----


A military complex. The boys are seated inside a hangar, with a lamp shining on them.

Cartman

Oh, dude, this is not cool!

Kyle

Relax, fatass.

Cartman

No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.

Stan

What??

Cartman

Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!

Stan, Kyle

Ow, dude! [the hangar doors open and the two agents enter]

Cartman

[pointing] Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! [Kenny looks at him]

Sphinx

Relax, boys. We just need to talk with you.

Stan

* I told you, fatass.

Connelly

Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space.

Cartman

Whoa, cool.

Sphinx

Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!

Cartman

Totally!

Connelly

Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? [holds up a picture of Marvin]

Cartman

Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.

Stan

Sshh!

Connelly

Who?

Kyle

You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!

Cartman

Oh. We don't know him.

Sphinx

We already know you know him. We have this! [a picture of the boys standing behind Marvin outside King Jimmy's Buffet] Now, who is he?! [Kyle farts, and the boys laugh]

Cartman

Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one? [the agents walk away and talk with each other. The boys laugh for a long time...]

Connelly

This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.

Sphinx

But they're just kids. We can't torture them.

Connelly

Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!

-----


Australia. The ship heads towards it, with a song playing in the cockpit. Marvin is enjoying his flight, but the screen tells him to debark

Singer


Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free.I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.



Man 1

[pointing] Oy, look up there! [the ship descends and the engines turn off]

Man 2

It's a UFO! [the windshield rolls back]

Crowd

[start backing up] Oohh?!

Marvin

[appears] Dogom * Dommm * *.

Man 3

Boy, that's one creeepy alien.

Marvin

Gmm * Mmm-mm * *.

Man 4

[prodding] Talk to 'im, Mayor. [the Mayor walks up to Marvin and speaks]

Mayor

Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip.

Crowd

Churrah! [Marvin pulls out pencil and paper and starts drawing...]

Mayor

Look out, he's got a gun! [shields his face. The others cower]

Man 5

Wait, it's not a gun. It's a piece of paper.

Mayor

Oh. [the paper has a drawing of Australia and of Marvin's people. Marvin draws an arrow from his people to Australia] Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia.

Marvin

* * Muogleblabla mb'g * *.

Mayor

Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. [it looks just like the one he left in Ethiopia. A woman is at the door.]

Woman

Hello-o. [Marvin looks, and the smile leaves his face. He hops back into the craft and takes off]

Mayor

Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.

-----


The military complex. The children are being tortured, but not physically. They moan and grunt

Sphinx

Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship?

Stan

We don't know. [some scratching is heard]

The Boys

Aaaaaaaa! [Sphinx is scratching at a balloon] Aaaaaaaa!

Connelly

[holds up a picture of Marvin in the spacecraft] Who is this person!

Cartman

[gasping] K-kill me.

Connelly

Do it again. [Sphinx scratches the balloon...]

The Boys

Aaaaaaaa!

Cartman

No wait. I'll tell you. [the agents take off their ear muffs] He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.

Kyle

Cartman!

Sphinx

Adopted from whom?

Cartman

Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.

Connelly

Sally Struthers!

Sphinx

Where can we find her?!

Connelly

I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.

Kyle

Good job, fatass!

Cartman

Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.

Stan

[moving past Kyle and Cartman] Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.

-----


Ethiopia, the FEED THE CHILDREN FOUNDATION building. The agents sit in the lobby reading newspapers

Receptionist

Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now. [the men rise and go for the door, but before they enter Connelly stops and closes the door]

Connelly

I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive.

Sphinx

Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know. [they enter. The storage room has been transformed into awfully dark living quarters for her]

Connelly

Ah, Ms. Struthers.

Sally

Oh ho ho ho. [she now has the shape of a Hutt] Un chaka solo david. Saime no Chewbacca dakaiminbi? ho ho. ["Hello gentlemen. How can I help you?"]

Connelly

Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.

Sally

Oh? Makarendae bi cho. ["I do my best."] Ho ho ho.

Connelly

We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him. [waves his hand in a Jedi fashion]

Sally

Do ba kim.

Sphinx

Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin.

Sally

[begins to sniff around] Jonoba unko chocolate Yum Yum bar ancho? ["Is that a chocolate Yum Yum bar in your pocket?"]

Connelly

Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers [removes it from his coat pocker and waves it around], and there are several more where that came from. [Sally licks her lips. Connelly sees a trash can nearby and opens it, then dangles the bar over it] Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy...

Sally

Mmmmo na ka!

Connelly

[closes the trashcan and walks over with the candy bar] I'm... glad we can do business.

-----


Cartman's house, night. The boys are on the sofa watching TV. Cartman has the remote

Stan

Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.

Cartman

Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? [a shot of Pat Robertson asking for pledges on the CBC channel.]

Pat

Uh, God wants you to send us money. He needs you to send us money so we can help others.

Cartman

Oh, my God, this guy again. ["What we do is- "]

Kyle

Why would anybody send this asshole money? ["-we go all around the world and-"]

Kenny

(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) [The boys laugh. "-we give Bibles and and, and..."]

Kyle

Yeh-hah. [They hear noise outside, and soon Marvin's ship crashes through the front wall of the house.]

Boys

Whoa! [They rush outside to see the rest of the ship. Cartman goes to see the damage]

Cartman

Oh! Aww! [Part of the second story of the house falls away.] Oh, weak! [Marvin hops down from the ship]

Kyle

Starvin' Marvin!

Marvin

Bongi groinit * *.

Kyle

He did take a ship.

Cartman

Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!

Marvin

Ingan *.

Stan

Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.

Marvin

Chede gwodum * * godom.

Kyle

I think he wants us to get in.

Stan

Kick ass! [Marvin returns to the pilot's seat; the others hop in and stand around him.] Wow, this thing is awesome!

Kyle

Let's go somewhere. [Marvin pulls the ship out of Cartman's house and flies low over the ground]

Singer


Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free.



Stan

[the ship goes higher, over other cities] Wow!

Kyle

Yes!

Singer


I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.



Stan

This is great!

Cartman

Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? ["And it's a wonderful day 'cause something-"]

Marvin

[turns off the music] Gmmm?

Stan

Yeah, that's better.

-----


Ethiopia, day. A man tries to rise, but doesn't have the energy to do it

Man

Oooh. [falls back on his pillow. Sister Hollis comes up]

Hollis

Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you.

Man

[quickly rising] Nn * wohg *?

Hollis

No, it's not food. It's a cross. [hands it to him] And it has your Christian name printed on it. From now on, you are Michael. Can you say "Michael"? [the man clicks and holds up the cross] Mmmi-chael. [the man clicks again] Oh, well. You'll get it. [walks away and heads over to a family of four] Hello, brother David. Do you have any sins to confess? [David does not respond, but a fly lands on his eye] Anybody? Sins to confess? Joshua? [he just looks up at her] You know, today I'm reminded of Psalm 46, line 39: "Though the mountains shake and th-" [the CIA agents walk up]

Connelly

Here they are!

Hollis

Who are you?

Connelly

We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!

Sphinx

Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here. [the family stares in horror]

-----


The Marklar ship, night. The boys are flying over a desert

Kyle

No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.

Marvin

Blubedegub? [points to Utah on the map]

Cartman

No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.

Stan

Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. [the world map is shown]

Cartman

Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? [presses a big red button on the left side of the display panel. The ship bucks and heads into space.]

Boys

Whooaaa! [the ship rolls sideways for a moment]

Stan

What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! [a wormhole appears before them, and they head for it]

Kyle

Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! [the ship races into the wormhole]

Boys

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [everything inside the ship begins to twist and warp] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [more twisting and warping, and the ship races out of the wormhole into a star system with a green planet. Everything inside the ship is normal again]

Kyle

[gasps] Where are we?

Marvin

Gobin gobedo * * gowog. [the ship heads down into the atmosphere and then towards an island]

Stan

We're on like, some foreign planet.

Kyle

This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.

Marvin

Gewhit * * Gewit um hebed wabaduh. Gabalah. [the ship descends to a plain next to a waterfall, and lands]

-----


Planet Marklar, day. The ship's windshield rolls back. The boys climb down and look around

Marvin

Badak bladla buk.

Marklar Leader

Greetings. Welcome to Marklar.

Stan

Uh, thanks.

Marklar Leader

I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar.

Stan

U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.

Marklar Leader

[bows] Marklar to you.

Stan

Cool!

Cartman

Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!

Stan

Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!

Cartman

Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! [the Marklar leader looks a bit confused. Marvin steps forward and smiles. The land around the group is green and lush, water is plentiful...]

Marklar Leader

We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.

Kyle

[joins Marvin] Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.

Marklar Leader

Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar.

Kyle

Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.

Stan

[Cartman looks in pleasant wonder] Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.

Marklar Leader

Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you.

Stan

Uuh. Thanks.

Marvin

* *.

-----


Ethiopia, day. The agents are still drilling Marvin's family

Connelly

Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him? [the family sits still]

Sphinx

[switching places with Connelly] We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?! [lifts his shades and scans the area] Daha! [picks up a gourd and dangles it] This! This gourd-thingy, for instance. How do you like that, huh? If you ever wanna see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy! [the family just looks at him. At that moment, the Marklar ship zooms over the little village, and the villagers raise a ruckus over Marvin's return. The ship stops and descends, engines roaring]

Sphinx

There it is! [Hollis covers her ears. The ship lands and everyone moves towards it. The windshield rolls back and the boys scramble down from the ship]

Marvin

Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.

Connelly

Back away from the space craft, children!

Stan

Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.

Kyle

Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. [the Ethiopians all begin to speak]

Hollis

Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?

Cartman

No, never. It's perfect.

Hollis

Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them. [hurries away]

Stan

What??

Marvin

*. [walks to Hollis] Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.

Kyle

Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!

Connelly

You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!

Kyle

No! [agents rush in from all sides and some black helicopters appear over the space ship. Two FBI agents come and stand behind the boys.]

Marvin

[tugs at Hollis' dress] Dor dor binor hm ghm.

Sphinx

Call those boys' mothers. [Connelly starts dialing] I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.

Kyle

Oh, no, dude!

-----


CBC television studios. The CBC logo, a pair of angel wings topped by a halo, and CBC printed in front of them, fills the screen. Next comes "Christian Broadcasting Channel"

Pat

["TO PLEDGE CALL: 1-800-555-2717"] You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan. [a picture of Hollis with two Ethiopians appears over his right shoulder] Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it.

Susan

Amazing.

Pat

Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ.

Susan

What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?

Pat

Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser. [a diagram of said cruiser appears over his shoulder: the XT-9000] Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen.

-----


Ethiopia. The agents are still investigating...

Connelly

I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.

FBI agent

[walks up] E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you.

Sphinx

Tom Brokaw? Oh no, the press already? [the CIA agents walk over]

"Brokaw"

[sounds like Cartman] Oh. Good day, gentlemen. [the yellow headband and the shape of the pant legs look familiar...]

Sphinx

Uh huh. [FBI agents gather behind him and Connelly] Mr. Brokaw, I presume.

"Brokaw"

You presume wisely, sir. I'm here to get the big story, the big scoop. [Marvin tip-toes to the ship unnoticed] I understand that you've found some kind of ship from an alien race. [Marvin opens the cargo door and signals for his people to enter the ship. They start doing so] Seeing as though I am Pulitzer-prize-winning Tom Brokaw...

Connelly

Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.

"Brokaw"

What?! Do you question my integritah?!

Kyle

[from the pants] I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!

"Brokaw"

Buh-eh, ugh. I had some bad burritos today.

Marvin

* * wughum chughum * *, * *.

Connelly

[he and Sphinx remove the men's clothes from the boys] Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.

Stan

Oh. [the cargo door closes and Marvin is ready to take off]

Connelly

Son of a bitch!

Stan

Run for it!

Connelly

Get 'em! [two FBI agents move]

Cartman

Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!

Kyle

Watch out! Here I come!

Kenny

(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-) [trips over a rock and lands on his face] (Oof.)

Kyle

Kenny!

Cartman

Forget him! He's done for! [Stan climbs up and looks back]

Stan

He's not done for, he's standing right there.

Kenny

(You guys, just fly away!)

Cartman

No, no, he's done for. Come on! [the windshield rolls down and the ship takes off. It zooms into the distance, then straight up into space. The helicopters could not catch up]

Sphinx

[holding Kenny] Nooo!

Connelly

Damnit, damnit, damnit!

-----


The Marklar ship, space. The ship speeds away from Earth.

Stan

Alright, we made it!

Kyle

Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!

Marvin

Gakchak ghm. [a blast is felt inside. Its impact site is near the cockpit]

Kyle

What was that? [the CBC's XT-9000 appears behind them. Inside, Sister Hollis is manning the bridge, with another woman and four men.]

Hollis

This is the Missionary 600. We have you locked on "fire: ready." Turn back right now. [another shot is fired, and the Marklar ship is hit again.]

Boys

Aaaa!

Ethiopians

[tossed to one side of the cargo bay] Whoa!

Stan

They're shooting at us.

Kyle

Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.

Marvin

[tries all the buttons, including the red one, but to no avail] Midik, gmanjaum * *.

Kyle

Well, how'd we do it last time??

Stan

Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.

Kyle

Which button did you press, Cartman??

Cartman

U-u-huh. I don't remember.

Kyle

You don't remember?!

Stan

You dumbass, Cartman!

Cartman

Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. [presses the big red button]

Singer


Soaring so high above the world.

The Missionary 600, still pursuing the Marklar ship

Hollis

The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough.

-----


The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting

Pat

Everyone, the Word of God is going around the world and all your help is so greatly appreciated. Eh-oo What we need now is an argon crystal laser. [the 900txl] Eh you see, an argon crystal laser can pierce thick space holes in a way that other lasers just can't. Send your money now. Uuh-I th-thank you.

-----


Ethiopia, day. Feed The Children Foundation. The agents are talking to Sally Struthers

Sally

[eating her way through a box of food relief] Onadonakami?

Connelly

Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel.

Sally

Chewmbacca vije dai gwo. ["Maybe I do, and maybe I don't."]

Sphinx

We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.

Sally

Juodo nakahobi? Ho ho ho ho. ["Why should I help you?"]

Sphinx

Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food.

Sally

Wo? Wo chaka gom??

Connelly

Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral. [steps aside and brings Kenny in]

Kenny

(Oh my God, I get it.)

Sally

Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho. [a small creature pops out and laughs]

The Missionary 600, still pursuing the Marklar ship

Hollis

I have the infidels in my sight. [the Marklar ship tries evasive maneuvers, but it is hit again.]

Cartman

Holy shit!

Ethiopians

[tossed to the other side of the cargo bay] Whoa!

Marvin

Doye dondabuh. [swings the ship around and fires two blasts at the Missionary 600]

Crew

Aaah.

Hollis

Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes.

-----


The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting

Pat

Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin. [a CBC logo pin]

-----


Space. The Missionary 600 and the Marklar ship now do battle. Marvin fires at the Missionaary 600 twice more.

600 Crew

Aaah.

Stan

You got 'em, Marvin.

Kyle

Yeah, now finish 'em off! [a huge junker comes up behind and fires at them]

Computer

[female voice] Warning. Deflector shields failing.

Kyle

Where did that come from??

Sally

Ho ho ho ho. [the CIA agents stand behind her, and two other men are at the helm]

Connelly

Good! Now get them in our tractor beam! [the beam is activated and holds the Marklar ship in place. The Missionary 600 comes around and faces the Marklar ship]

Hollis

Now we've got 'em! [in the Marklar ship, the boys look at the screen...]

Sally

Ho ho ho ho.

Cartman

It's Sally Struthers!

Hollis

Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens.

Kyle

Sorry, Marvin. We tried.

Cartman

Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!

Sally

Wo?

Cartman

Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. [Sally looks moved]

Sally

Holna chewbacca? ["Because of me?"]

Sphinx

Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite. [points. The camera pans over to a panel which shows Kenny encased in carbonite]

Sally

Dama doko nou na oh. ["Let him speak."]

Cartman

Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. [Sally considers Cartman's statements for a moment, then...]

Sally

Oh, foada! ["You're right!" She presses a button, and the tractor beam switches off the Marklar ship and on the Missionary 600]

600 Crew

[the bridge jerks a bit] Whoa! [the beam pulls the Missionary 600 closer to the junker.]

Cartman

She bought it.

Stan

Sally Struthers is saving us!

The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting

Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker [pictured in a window], which is uh the favorite ship of the Hutts, and she has trapped oureh, our our new CBC ship in an uh [struggling] poe-sitronic tractor beam. [a stage hand holds up this cue card that reads: Tractor Beam, so we're gonna need a Ionic Tractor Disruptor] Uh, so we're gonna need an ionic tractor disruptor. Now now, not a regular ionic di- tractor disruptor, but a negative ionic tractor disruptor to uh, help spread the Word of Jesus. [to Susan, softly] I don't have a fucking idea up here.

Space. The junker is busy pulling the Missionary 600 in. The Marklar ship is free to leave

Stan

Now's our chance!

Cartman

Wait. I remember. It was the red button! [presses it, and the ship zooms away. The wormhole appears again and the ship head for it]

Hollis

They've opened the wormhole!

Kyle

It's pulling us in! [the junker and the Missionary 600 give chase. All three ships enter the wormhole, and all experience its warping effects.]

Boys

Aaaah!

600 Crew

Aaaah! [the ships rush out of the wormhole and into Alpha Seti VI, near the Marklar planet]

Marklar. The ship land. The Missionary 600 has to lean to one side. All parties are out of their ships

Kyle

Marvin... [everyone talks at once]

Marklar

Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar.

Hollis

Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins.

Marklar

Who? Marklar?

Stan

We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.

Marklar

Brought m- marklar??

Hollis

What is "marklar"?

Marklar

Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.

Sphinx

Doesn't that get confusing?

Marklar

Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!

Marklar

[in orange robe] Yes?

Marklar

You see?

Kyle

[steps forward] Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.

Marklar

Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true.

Hollis

What the hell did he say?

Stan

[hushed] Wow! Good job, dude!

Kyle

Thanks.

Marklar

The marklars can stay!

Ethiopians

Wooo!

Boys

Alright!

Cartman

Alright,

Marklar

You marklars must leave.

Hollis

But you will all burn forever in eternal hellfire. [she and the other woman are taken away]

Marklar

Yes, that's nice. Thank you for stopping by.

Stan

Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.

Marvin

Chak chak glika gm gm guchab mglup.

Kyle

No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.

Sally

Bwo chaaga bi.

Boys

[leaving] Goodbye, Marvin.

Marvin

Chak chak m geteaub m * *.

Stan

Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.

Cartman

Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.

Stan

Dude!

Cartman

What? We're not gonna come visit him.

Stan

I know, but you don't tell him that!

Cartman

T'heh, whatever. [the Ethiopians chatter over their new home and head for the lake at the foot of the waterfall]
