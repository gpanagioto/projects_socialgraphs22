All right children, let's take our seats. Well, uh d-don't you all look nice. What the hell is going on?? Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!! WHAT?? It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore.  Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over. Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave? Well, you know... Huh. Oh hey Randy. Well thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom? Not, not like that? Uh-Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek. Oh, wuh, well uh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place. Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass. Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?! Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?! Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!! No, ''your'' shoes say you take it in the butt!! One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!  Chef, can I talk to you? Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me! Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?  Kyle, what are you doing here? What?? That's what I'm doing! They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours! No you didn't! No you didn't! I thought of it yesterday! I thought of it before you were born! Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together. Room service.  Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.  Well crap, that didn't work.  Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing! But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left. Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!  Oh my God.  Gone??  I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind!  Stop them! They're crab people! You bastards!  Yes! They were trying to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world! So now, can you ''please'' change your network's programming?
