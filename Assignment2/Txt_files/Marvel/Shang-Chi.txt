The character was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]], debuting in ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15 (December 1973) in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], and starring in his own solo title until 1983. Described as the greatest martial artist alive, Shang-Chi has been trained since birth to be the ultimate fighter with a specialization in various unarmed and weaponry-based [[Chinese martial arts|''wushu'']] styles, including the use of the ''[[Gun (staff)|gùn]]'', ''[[nunchaku]]'', and ''[[jian]]''.  Shang-Chi later assumes leadership of the [[Five Weapons Society]] and acquires the [[Mandarin's rings#Ten Rings (Ta-Lo)|Ten Rings]] weapons.

Shang-Chi was spun off from novelist [[Sax Rohmer]]'s licensed property as the unknown son of fictional villain [[Zheng Zu|Dr. Fu Manchu]]. In later editions, his connection to Dr. Fu Manchu was underplayed after Marvel lost the comic book rights to the latter's character; to get around this problem, the publisher eventually renamed Shang-Chi's father Zheng Zu.

[[Shang-Chi (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shang-Chi]] made his live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021), where he is portrayed by [[Simu Liu]].

==Publication history==
In the early 1970s, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]] approached [[DC Comics]] to adapt the television series ''[[Kung Fu (1972 TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' into a comic book, as DC's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], owned the rights to the series. DC Comics, however, was not interested in their pitch, believing the show's and the [[martial arts]] genre popularity would fade quickly. The duo then approached [[Marvel Comics]] with the idea to create a [[kung fu]]-focused original comic. Editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] agreed, but only if they would include the [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp villain [[Fu Manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]], as Marvel had previously acquired the comic book rights to the character, and made their protagonist [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|half-white]]. Englehart and Starlin agreed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/09/04/entertainment/shang-chi-marvel-comics-history-cec/index.html|title = Inside Shang-Chi's evolution from forgotten comic book character to big-screen superhero}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://universohq.com/english/jim-starlin-success-written-stars/|title= A success written in the stars|date= March 3, 2001|publisher= [[Universo HQ]]|access-date = September 8, 2021}}</ref> They developed Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Dr. Fu Manchu.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanderson |first1=Peter |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0756641238 |location=London, United Kingdom |page=161 |chapter=1970s |quote=Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer Steve Englehart and artist/co-plotter Jim Starlin created Marvel's ''Master of Kung Fu'' series.

No characters from the ''Kung Fu'' television series were officially included in the comic series, though in the #19 issue the character Lu Sun bore such a strong resemblance to [[Kwai Chang Caine]] that to avoid copyright issues, the character was given a mustache throughout the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/shang-chi-how-marvel-edited-a-comic-to-hide-a-kung-fu-characters-appearance/ |title=Shang-Chi: How Marvel Edited a Comic to Hide a Kung Fu Character's Appearance |author=Brian Cronin |date=October 27, 2021 |publication-date=October 26, 2021 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |quote=In #19, Shang-Chi runs afoul of the monstrous Man-Thing, who can burn anyone who experiences fear while touching him.

Moench later recalled to Jon B. Cooke in TwoMorrows' Comic Book Artist #7, while noting that no one had ever bothered them during their time together on the series (when they had cameos and facial likenesses of a number of major characters), "There had been an earlier problem when Paul drew David Carradine and they actually had to go over Paul's artwork and put a mustache on the David Carradine character, but for some reason, when we were doing it, it all slipped by and there was never any problem." |access-date=March 7, 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/shang-chi-how-mcu-superhero-connects-warner-bros-show/ |title=Shang-Chi: How the MCU Superhero Connects to an Old Warner Bros.

Amidst the martial arts craze in the United States in the 1970s, the book became very popular, surviving until issue #125 (June 1983), a solid run that included four ''Giant-Size'' issues and one ''Annual''. ''Special Collector's Edition'' #1 (1975) cover-titled as "Savage Fists of Kung Fu" reprinted stories from ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #1–2; ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Special'' #1; and ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2265|title= ''Special Collector's Edition''}}</ref> The character did several crossovers with other Marvel martial artists, including the [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] ([[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]]). He appeared regularly in ''[[The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]''.

Shang-Chi had two more short series: the ''Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue (1990) and the [[Max (comics)|MAX]] miniseries ''Master of Kung Fu: Hellfire Apocalypse'' (2002) with artist Paul Gulacy on art again. The character had two stories in the [[comics anthology]] series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', including one by Moench that ran in the series' first eight issues in 1988, and co-starred in the ''[[Moon Knight]] Special'' (1992).

In 1995, Shang-Chi would be one of the revival titles produced by [[Milestone Media]], according to writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], the title would show Shang-Chi using firearms, inspired by [[gun fu]] style by Hong Kong filmmaker [[John Woo]]; however, according to McDuffie, the proposal was cancelled after the departure of editor-in-chief [[Tom DeFalco]] and the death of [[Mark Gruenwald]] the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 12, 2021|title=Shang-Chi Almost Starred in a Marvel Series from Milestone Media|url=https://www.cbr.com/shang-chi-almost-marvel-milestone-media/|access-date=September 15, 2021|website=CBR|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1997 a story arc starring Shang-Chi ran in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #514–516, and was intended to lead into a miniseries for the character in 1998.<ref>{{cite news | last = Middaugh | first= Dallas | date = August 1997 | title = ''Journey into Mystery'' to Launch New Titles | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = #72 | page = 23}}</ref> 

Although spun out of licensed properties, Shang-Chi is a Marvel-owned character and has been firmly established as a part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with guest appearances in numerous other titles, such as ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''. Most of the original licensed characters in the supporting cast have been either phased out or renamed in the more recent series and stories.

In some of his modern appearances, mention is made of his villainous father either in cryptic terms or using a variety of new names, due to Marvel no longer having the rights to Dr. Fu Manchu. In 2010's ''Secret Avengers'' #6–10, writer [[Ed Brubaker]] officially sidestepped the entire issue via a storyline where the [[Shadow Council]] resurrects a zombified version of Dr. Fu Manchu, only to discover that "Dr. Fu Manchu" was only an alias and that Shang-Chi's father real name was [[Zheng Zu]], an ancient Chinese sorcerer who discovered the secret to immortality.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 29, 2021|title=Shang-Chi: How the MCU's New Hero Was First Connected to the Ten Rings|url=https://www.cbr.com/shang-chi-ten-rings-comic-book-debut/|access-date=September 3, 2021|website=CBR|language=en-US}}</ref> Similarly, Shang-Chi's half sister [[Fah Lo Suee]] was later renamed [[Zheng Bao Yu]] in 2013's ''[[The Fearless Defenders]]'' #8, written by Cullen Bunn,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shang-Chi Comics Explained: Where The Next MCU Movie Came From|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shang-chi-comics-explained-where-the-next-mcu-movie-came-from/1100-6495745/|access-date=September 3, 2021|website=GameSpot|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Young|first=Aaron|date=May 6, 2021|title=These Are Shang-Chi's Biggest Foes|url=https://www.looper.com/402132/these-are-shang-chis-biggest-foes/|access-date=September 3, 2021|website=Looper.com|language=en-US}}</ref> while Smith and Petrie have not appeared in any Marvel properties since the end of the ''Master of Kung Fu'' series in 1983.

Shang-Chi returned as a main character in the 2007 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' comic book. In 2009, the [[black and white]] one-shot ''Shang-Chi: Master of Kung'' Fu was released, with stories written by [[Jonathan Hickman]], [[Mike Benson (screenwriter)|Mike Benson]], [[Charlie Huston]] and [[Robin Furth]] and illustrated by [[Tomm Coker]], C.P.

Written by [[Haden Blackman]] and illustrated by Taljic, the four-issue series is a ''[[wuxia]]''-inspired story that takes place in the [[Battleworld]] domain of [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Regions and countries|K'un-Lun]] and centered around Shang-Chi in his fight to overthrow his despotic father, Emperor Zheng Zu.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://comicsalliance.com/shang-chi-master-of-kung-fu-secret-wars/ |title=Shang-Chi Gets New Series & New World In 'Master Of Kung-Fu' |access-date=June 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613184425/http://comicsalliance.com/shang-chi-master-of-kung-fu-secret-wars/ |archive-date=June 13, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After assassinating Petrie, Shang-Chi encounters Dr. Fu Manchu's archenemy Sir Denis Nayland Smith, who tells Shang-Chi his father's true nature.

Shang-Chi is approached by triad clan leader and former enemy Skull-Crusher who offers him a truce; Chao Sima alleges he and Leiko became lovers while she was working undercover and had planned to defect from MI-6 for him. With help from Skull-Crusher and the newly arrived [[Daughters of the Dragon]] and the [[Sons of the Tiger]], Shang-Chi confirms that Razor Fist was hired by the White Dragon to kill Leiko due to her involvement with his rival Skull-Crusher and discovers that the White Dragon has access to Mao Shan Pai, a powerful Chinese black magic. Shang-Chi and Skull-Crusher infiltrate the White Dragon's estate, where they discover a room displaying the decapitated heads of missing triad leaders.

With the Mao Shan Pai spellbook taken by the White Dragon's men, [[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|M'Nai]] plans to use its magic to give him power and influence over the triad clans, finally fulfilling Zheng Zu's legacy.

Instead of giving him power, the spell resurrects Leiko from Chao's spilled blood. Since Skull-Crusher made her the leader of his clan before her death, Chao's death violated the ritual and resurrected Leiko to punish Midnight Sun. Shang-Chi is able to knock out Midnight Sun during their fight while Leiko brutally maims Razor Fist. Leiko uses her newfound powers to summon the dead spirits of Skull-Crusher, the White Dragon and the other dead triad leaders, who drag Midnight Sun into their realm.

Shang-Chi reveals the truth of their father's nature and attempts to convince Shi-Hua to leave the Society, but is rebuked. Mistakenly believing that Shang-Chi murdered Zheng Zu, Shi-Hua is outraged that their father's spirit would choose Shang-Chi over her to succeed him and reveals that she can only be legitimized as the Society's Supreme Commander by killing Shang-Chi. Shang-Chi realizes that his sister had poisoned him and begins to succumb to its effects. Instead of dying, Shang-Chi awakens in one of the House's laboratory, whose panicked scientists unleash a swarm of [[jiangshi]] to kill him.

Guided by the map, Shang-Chi and his siblings are directed to Yi's tomb in Henan, where Yi's spirit appears to him in full flesh. Shang-Chi requests Yi's guidance in stopping Shi-Hua and her jiangshi and to heal his festering wound inflicted by the jiangshi. Instead, Yi's spirit tells Shang-Chi to stop running away from his family, otherwise he would lose his way like his father and that his wounds would lead to something greater.

Instead of resisting, Shang-Chi calms himself, which transports the two to an astral plane where they witness memories of Shi-Hua's harsh upbringing by their father at the House of the Deadly Hand in Russia. Realizing that her anger is at Zheng Zu rather than Shang-Chi, Shi-Hua stops her assault, causing the jiangshi to collapse and Shang-Chi's wounds to heal. However, Shi-Hua blames Shang-Chi for robbing her of her life's purpose and flees before Leiko can apprehend her.

Shang-Chi is classed as an athlete but he is one of the best non-superhumans in martial arts and has dedicated much of his life to the art, being referred to by some as the greatest empty-hand fighter and practitioner of kung fu alive, with even [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] acknowledging him as one of the few mortals who can hold their own against a god without the use of magic.<ref name="SwordMaster4">{{cite comic|writer= Pak, Greg|penciller= Anindito, Ario|inker= Anindito, Ario|story= Sword Master & Shang-Chi: Master Class Part Four|title= Sword Master|issue= #4|date= Dec. 2019}}</ref> In addition, Shang-Chi has battled superpowered foes like [[Ben Grimm]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] in hand-to-hand combat and proved a formidable opponent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wolfman |first1=Marv |last2=Wilson |first2=Ron |title=Two Against Hydra |journal=Marvel Two-in-One |date=July 1977 |volume= |issue=#29 |pages=7–10 }}</ref> Many of his physical abilities seem to stem from his mastery of chi, which often allows him to surpass physical limitations of normal athletes. He has also demonstrated the ability to dodge and catch bullets from machine guns and sniper rifles, and is able to deflect gunshots with his bracers. Shang-Chi is also highly trained in concentration and meditation, and is an expert in various hand weapons including [[sword]]s, [[stick fighting|staff]]s, [[kali stick]]s, [[nunchaku]], and [[shuriken]].

Shortly after reuniting with his mother, Shang-Chi discovered that he inherited [[List of Marvel Comics characters: J#Jiang Li|Jiang Li]]'s psionic abilities, allowing him to form psychic bonds with his blood relatives. These bonds allow Shang-Chi to sense their location or feel any pain that is inflicted upon them.<ref name=":3" /> Shang-Chi's psionic abilities also extend to his dead relatives, allowing him to communicate and interact with the spirits of his deceased uncle<ref name=":2" /> and father.<ref>''Shang-Chi'' #5.

While adventuring in [[Ta-Lo]], Shang-Chi acquired the heavenly [[Mandarin's rings#Ten Rings (Ta-Lo)|Ten Rings]] from the Jade Emperor, granting him a variety of powers and abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, durability and stamina, as well as allowing him to fly and levitate.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /> Shang-Chi can control the Rings telepathically which can be used in a variety of ways, including launching them as projectiles, utilizing them as platforms for transportation and generating makeshift chains to grab objects and restrain opponents.<ref name=":5" /> The Ten Rings can also alter their size, either shrinking down to fit Shang-Chi's wrists or enlarge themselves to ensnare a human.<ref name=":5" /> When Shang-Chi first wore the Ten Rings, his fear of their power corrupting him allowed Chieftain Xin to take control of the Rings away from him. However, when Shang-Chi gave in to his desire, he was able to reclaim the Ten Rings and unlock their potential, increasing his strength and abilities but giving him a similar likeness and personality of his father. Although Shang-Chi was able to completely fight off his father's influence, the Ten Rings still retained their unlocked power and loyalty to him.<ref name=":5" />

==Other versions==
==="Secret Wars" (2015)===
In the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, a version of Shang-Chi resides in the [[wuxia]]-inspired [[K'un-Lun]] region of [[Battleworld]]. In this continuity, he is the exiled son of Emperor '''[[Zheng Zu#Secret Wars (2015)|Zheng Zu]], Master of the Ten Rings''', a ruthless martial arts school that uses mystical powers and techniques based on [[Mandarin's rings|the powers of the Mandarin's ten rings]] from the [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]]. Shang-Chi is wanted for the murder of Lord Tuan, the master of the [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] school, the main rivals of the Ten Rings school. A drunk vagabond, Shang-Chi is approached by [[Kitty Pryde|Kitten]] to help teach her and her group of fellow outcasts who had been exiled from each of their respective schools the techniques of the Ten Rings. Ashamed by his upbringing, Shang-Chi coldly refuses and insults the group, outraging their leader, [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], who informs the emperor of Shang-Chi's whereabouts. The gang's hideout raided by K'un Lun's sheriff and Tuan's student [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand-K'ai]], the emperor's assassin [[Elektra (comics)|Red Sai]] of the [[The Hand (comics)|Red Hand]] school and Ten Rings enforcer [[Taskmaster (comics)|Laughing Skull]] but after Laughing Skull kills outcast [[Cypher (comics)|Cy]] against Rand-K'ai's orders, Shang-Chi helps the group escape with the '''Nightbringer''' technique. A guilt ridden Shang-Chi agrees to take the outcasts as his pupils, dubbing their new school '''The Lowest Caste'''. Shang-Chi returns from his exile to represent the Lowest Caste for the tournament held every thirteen years to decide which participating master would be the next ruler of K'un-Lun. Zu allows Shang-Chi to participate but alters the rules so Shang-Chi would have to defeat every representative before facing him in the Thirteen Chambers.

To spare his lover and her students from the emperor's wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu implicated and exiled his son for the murder to cover his own involvement. After the truth is revealed, Red Sai and Rand-K'ai let Shang-Chi pass so that he could defeat his father. During the fight between Shang-Chi and Zheng Zu, Zu attempts to kill his son with the '''Spectral Touch''' technique, only for the move to pass through him due to Shang-Chi learning Kitten's [[Kitty Pryde#Powers and abilities|technique to become intangible]]. Shang-Chi proceeds to use nine of the Ten Ring techniques against his father and ultimately defeats him with '''[[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|The Gorgon's Eye]]''', which turns him into stone.
