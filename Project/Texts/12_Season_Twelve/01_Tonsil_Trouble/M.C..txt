We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV.  With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman. Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit. I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman. , these two brave friends- These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys , here is... Jimmy Buffett!
