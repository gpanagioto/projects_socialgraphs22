==Fictional character biography==
Condor is a winged criminal scientist and is a member of the Bird-People, an offshoot of the [[Inhumans]] that adopted [[Red Raven (Marvel Comics)|Red Raven]]. He was a member of the Terrible Trio, along with [[Diamondhead (comics)|Diamondhead]] and [[Powerhouse (comics)#Powerhouse (Rieg Davan)|Powerhouse]],<ref>''Nova'' #6-8, #10</ref> and an enemy of [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and the [[Champions of Xandar]]. During a battle with the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)#The First Sphinx|Sphinx]], he was transformed into an actual condor.<ref>''Nova'' #10</ref>

Condor spent several years in the form of an animal until he landed on the island of [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]] and the Ani-Mates. Bird-Brain recognized that the Condor was not a real animal and transformed him into a semi-humanoid. He confronted Nova again angrily and ultimately left feeling their conflict had been useless.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 2 #5</ref>

Condor later attacked Nova and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], but was defeated and taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. Red Raven took this opportunity to attempt to bring the Condor back by force, hoping to place him on trial among the Bird-People to face justice. Red Raven led a group of Avians to assault Manhattan, but Nova managed to convince him to call off the attack.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 3 #7</ref>

The Condor appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #562-563</ref>

It is revealed in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] series that Condor is one of the inmates left behind in the [[Negative Zone]] 42 prison. He, [[Bison (comics)|Bison]], and [[Gorilla-Man]] II are involved in a fight with [[Star-Lord]] who, with the help of [[Jack Flag]], is trying to stop [[Blastaar]] and his horde from invading Earth via the closed portal in the prison.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #9</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Condor was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. After his memory was restored by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] and [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], he joined the villains on a rampage against S.H.I.E.L.D. and fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #8</ref>
