Tom, I'm standing in front of the home of Chris and Linda Stotch. They're living every parent's nightmare right now, as last night, while Ms. Stotch was driving with her son in the car, a man stopped her, put a gun to her head, and took her son away. When asked who the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, "some Puerto Rican guy." Naturally, the police are in an all-out manhunt for some Puerto Rican guy.  Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper look like?
