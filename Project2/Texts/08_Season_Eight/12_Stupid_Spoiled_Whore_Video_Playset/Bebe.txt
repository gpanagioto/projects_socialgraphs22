Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it! Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall! Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here! Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls.  Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous! Thanks, Annie!  You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party. You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity! Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost! Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited.  Party at my house tonight, Kyle. Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue! Hey Kevin, party at my house. We're being stupid spoiled whores.  What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?! Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule! Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for. Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all. Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
