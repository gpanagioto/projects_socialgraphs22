'''Hydro-Man''' ('''Morris''' "'''Morrie'''" '''Bench''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] as an enemy of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=7}}</ref> Once an ordinary [[crewman]], Morris Bench was accidentally knocked overboard while stationed on his ship during a battle between Spider-Man and [[Namor]], and fell into the ocean, where a powerful experimental generator was being tested. This led to his transformation into Hydro-Man who, blaming Spider-Man for what happened to him, turned to a life of crime while seeking revenge against the web-slinger.

The character has appeared in several media adaptations over the years, including animated series and video games. A creature based on "Hydro-Man" appeared in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). [[IGN]] ranked him as Spider-Man's 25th greatest enemy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|website=IGN}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Morris "Morrie" Bench gained his [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]] while working as a [[crewman]] on the cargo ship the [[United States Ship|U.S.S.]] ''Bulldog'', having been knocked overboard accidentally by Spider-Man (right after the hero finished a fight against [[Namor]]) while a powerful experimental generator is being tested in the ocean. The combination of unknown radiation and his immersion in a deep ocean-dwelling bacteria turns him into Hydro-Man.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=200}}</ref> When he realized that he had become a man-of-water, he blamed Spider-Man for his accident and started to hunt him (through many showers, sewers and water valves), in order to get revenge on the hero, but was defeated in combat.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #212. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Soon after that in the story arc "Eye of the Beholder", he teams up with and briefly becomes merged with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] into a composite mud monster called Mud-Thing. In this form, Hydro-Man and Sandman had limited intelligence and they did not have the ability to use their shape-shifting abilities as well as before. Although it was composed of the two aforementioned villains, it showed no indication of either villain's persona outside of an infatuation with Sadie Frickett, the current love interest of both villains. Soon after, a theater agent named Travis Rave proposed that Sadie and Mud-Thing be in a show, which Sadie gladly accepted at the prospect of stardom. Unfortunately, when the show proved to be a huge success, Sadie accidentally kissed Travis out of excitement, thereby enraging the jealous Mud-Thing. Mud-Thing ended up going on a rampage and carried Sadie with him to the top a sky-scraper. The creature was eventually defeated with a special gas that dried it out and caused it to crumble apart. Spider-Man managed to save Sadie from her plummet, but she ended up being genuinely upset over the loss of Mud-Thing, knowing that all it had ever done wrong was simply love her. After its defeat by Spider-Man and the police, Sandman and Hydro-Man separated from this form when the police were cleaning up Mud-Thing's remains.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #217–218. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hydro-Man joined [[supervillain]] teams such as the [[Sinister Syndicate]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #280–281. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Frightful Four]]. While working with the Sinister Syndicate, Hydro-Man demonstrates a willingness to put up with just about anything in the name of financial gain. He ignores the constant politicking of the other members and looks past the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]]'s betrayal of the group to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] in the belief that the group was economically beneficial to him. Hydro Man was a member of [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]'s Masters of Evil, and battled the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 1997''.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Morris was one of the 46 villains to escape the Raft when [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] was broken out by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. Before escaping, he attempts to drown [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]], [[Foggy Nelson]], and [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, he is seen alongside [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]. This group attempts to rob Baily's Auction House but are interrupted by Spider-Man and then [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] members [[War Machine]] and [[Komodo (comics)#Character from Avengers: The Initiative|Komodo]]. The latter are there to neutralize Spider-Man. The trio escapes, but they are later defeated by the [[Scarlet Spiders]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When a member of Wizard's Frightful Five, Hydro-Man received a costume from Wizard that is made from the same material as the Human Torch's costume.

Marvel Comics.</ref> He is defeated and captured by employees of Horizon Labs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700. Marvel Comics.</ref> In a plot to drown New York City in its filth as part of a ransom demand, Hydro-Man absorbed the wastewater from the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant. His plan was thwarted by Spider-Man with the help of Deadpool, where Spider-Man threw Deadpool inside of him with active grenades.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hawkeye and a displaced version of [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]] from Earth-51920 later encounter Hydro-Man who is working for a group called Oasis Spring Water that has been draining the underground reservoir that's on the property of the Sweet Medicine Indian Reservation. He managed to defeat Hawkeye and Red Wolf.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After getting themselves free, Hawkeye and Red Wolf fight Oasis Spring Water again.

Hydro-Man later encounters a scientist named Dr. Rachna Koul who is working on "curing him". When Hercules arrived with Human Torch and Thing, Hydro-Man lashed out at them thinking it was a trap.

Hydro-Man ran into [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Nakia)|Nakia]] whilst spelunking around an abandoned [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] base in New York City, who enthralled him to her will using the jufeiro herb, leaving Bench to guard over the base to cover her tracks in the event her old colleges managed to follow her. When the rest of the Adored Ones accompanied by Spider-Man did infiltrate the undersea facility where a potential WMD of the wives in waiting's design was kept. Hydro immediately set about his preprogrammed task, but was quickly dispatched by Okoye's quick thinking and useful Wakandan Tech engineering.<ref>''Spider-Man: Wakanda Forever'' #1 (June 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

At some point, Hydro-Man was captured and imprisoned in [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]]. Somehow, Namor managed to siphon Hydro-Man's power over water into himself in order to aid Namor's latest war effort on the surface world.<ref>''Invaders #2.''</ref> He was later freed by [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes]].<ref>''Invaders #10''.

During the "[[Sinister War]]" storyline, Hydro-Man was with [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Overdrive (character)|Overdrive]], Shocker, and Speed Demon when Kindred challenged them, the Sinister Six, the [[Savage Six]], the Sinister Syndicate, and [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]]'s group on who will kill Spider-Man first. It was also noted that Hydro-Man was not a member of the Superior Foes. Hydro-Man assists Boomerang, Shocker, and Speed Demon in fighting Foreigner's group in order to buy Overdrive time to get Spider-Man away.<ref>''Sinister War'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Hydro-Man is able to bodily transform himself into a watery liquid substance; he can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease; when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man's cells remain fully under his control when he is in his liquid state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his liquid form. He can increase his mass and cause tidal waves and tsunamis. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. Through great mental exertion, Hydro-Man can also turn into steam. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire hose, shaping parts of his body into 'solid-water' constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. 

The Wizard enhanced his powers, through the use of sophisticated equipment.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #514-516</ref> These artificial enhancements granted him increased and more precise control over bodies of water and moisture near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in the [[Trapster]]'s body.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #514</ref> His abilities were further augmented through the use of re-purposed super community technologies processed by [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] from the corrupt and deranged former CEO of the company, Walter Declun.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #11-12</ref> However, Spider-Man teamed up with Iceman and used Iceman's powers to solidify him into ice.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Hydro-Man claims that he has not aged since he gained his powers.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #51</ref> Hydro-Man possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, and has been shown to be an exceptionally skilled fighter, and adept at using his powers for that purpose. 

In some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his forearms into weapons such as Sandman does, except that Bench's weapons are made of water.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Bench has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques due to his experience as a criminal before his transformation. Though cunning, he has been consistently depicted by writers as a low tier henchman with little formal education and is often tricked into using his powers in ways that incapacitate him (as explained above). His normal attire consists of a black shirt and blue or green pants, as well as a costume invented by the Wizard.

After being expelled from school, his parents enlisted him in the Navy to keep him out of trouble. While in the special research unit working as a crewman, he was knocked overboard into the ocean, whereupon his body was covered in a strange chemical that altered his cellular structure, allowing him to control any liquid at will and turn into water. Debuting in his self-titled episode, Hydro-Man attempts to win Watson back. As she repeatedly rejects his advances, he becomes more desperate and comes to see Spider-Man as a romantic rival. After robbing a museum and stashing its riches inside a water filtration plant, Hydro-Man kidnaps Watson and keeps her there as well. Upon discovering the plant, Spider-Man fights Hydro-Man until they end up on the rooftop, where the latter evaporates due to having no water sources nearby. A clone of Hydro-Man created by Professor [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Miles Warren]] later appears in the two-part episode, "The Return of Hydro-Man", wherein the former kidnaps a water-based clone of Watson and battles Spider-Man inside Warren's underwater lab until both clones degenerate and evaporate.
