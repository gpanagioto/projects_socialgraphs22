Ughh. Naw, I'm with Wendy. Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her. Sounds like police sirens. I don't know.  Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone? What?! Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!  This is not the time for that! Dude, do you understand what's going on here?!  Wait, you have guns here? Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?! I can't let them do it.  Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away.   Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich.. I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail. I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe. If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck? Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller? He done killed yer pahr. I know.
