Where are you going? So? You can poo in the wilderness. Not here! Go further away! Sick, dude!  We don't wanna ''look'' at it, Cartman! I see it!  I saw it this way! Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way! I think his name is Junjun. Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends? Wow!  No, he's annoying. Why don't we just tell our parents?  Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.  Sh! Keep quiet, stupid! Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond? God-damn!  Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?  Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing. Dude, it's crowded in here. Oh, no! ''Nothing's'' worse than Cartman with authoritah! Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.  Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that. Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
