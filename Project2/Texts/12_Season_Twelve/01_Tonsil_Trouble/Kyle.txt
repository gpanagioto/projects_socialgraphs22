Cartman has HIV? Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV? ...No. Way. ...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute.   I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly. I do.  I'm sorry. I gotta go home.  Wagh. What? No?! What? No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  I'm gonna kill you, Cartman! Why do I have HIV?! What did you do?! Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?!  Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!    He gave me AIDS! He purposely infected me with his HIV virus! An apology?!  ...What?! A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!  There is no cure, you asshole! What hope?! You're lying! Magic Johnson? So what?!  You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox! Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him! NO!  Don't. Touch me.  Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.  What part of this is funny to you?!! What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!!  So shut the fuck up!!  Knock it off!! Right now!! This isn't funny!! At all!!  Yes!!! Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around? But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep? Dude. You sleep with money. Every night? Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...  Wugh. Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS! I'm still breaking your Xbox.
