'''Doctor Poison''' is a fictional character appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media, commonly as a recurring adversary of the superhero [[Wonder Woman]]. A sadistic bioterrorist with a ghoulish face, she first appeared in 1942’s ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' (volume 1) #2, written by Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]] and illustrated by [[H.G. Peter|Harry G. Peter]], and holds a distinction as Wonder Woman’s first costumed supervillain.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Daniels |first=Les |title=Wonder Woman: The Complete History |publisher=Chronicle Books LLC |year=2000 |page=34}}</ref> 

As the narrative continuity of Wonder Woman comics has been adjusted by different writers and artists throughout the years, various versions of Doctor Poison have been presented, usually as perversely cruel toxicologists of Japanese descent. There have been at least four different incarnations of the character since her debut: (1) the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Doctor Poison '''Princess Maru''', (2) the [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] Doctor Poison, Princess Maru’s mysterious unnamed granddaughter, first appearing in 1999’s '' [[Wonder Woman (comic book)|Wonder Woman]] '' (volume 2) #151, (3) the short-lived [[The New 52|New 52]] Doctor Poison, a Russian scientist known only as '''Dr. Maru''', first appearing in 2016’s ''Wonder Woman'' (volume 4) #48, and (4) '''Colonel Marina Maru''', a [[DC Rebirth|Post-Rebirth]] reformulation of the character who heads an elite team of mercenaries known as "Poison", first appearing in 2017’s ''Wonder Woman'' (volume 5) #13.

Doctor Poison has been adapted into several Wonder Woman media projects beyond comic books, notably [[Patty Jenkins|Patty Jenkins’]] high-profile 2017 feature film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (in which the character was played by [[Elena Anaya]]) and the 2019 [[Warner Bros. Animation|Warner Brothers]] animated film '' [[Wonder Woman: Bloodlines]]'' (in which she was played by voice actor [[Courtenay Taylor]]).

==Publication history==
=== Golden Age ===
{{main|Golden Age of Comic Books}}

In her first appearance, Doctor Poison is presented as an ostensibly male figure in a hooded green surgical gown and black domino mask. Depicted with an eerie wide-eyed gaze and unsettling grimace, the character was an Axis scientist and mastermind who headed both the fictional Nazi Poison Division and the chemical research branch of the Japanese army.<ref>Jimenez, Phil. ''The Essential Wonder Woman Encyclopedia'', Del Rey Books, 2010, p. 115.</ref> Apprehended by Wonder Woman after commanding a bio-attack on an Allied military base, Doctor Poison is unmasked as a young woman named Princess Maru, a Japanese royal who disguised herself as a male supervillain to better protect her identity – a genderplay trope her creator William Moulton Marston incorporated into several other foes he conceived to battle Wonder Woman,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Daniels |first=Les |title=Wonder Woman: The Complete History |publisher=Chronicle Books LLC |year=2000 |page=34}}</ref> including the [[Blue Snowman]] and [[Hypnota]]. In a move that might be understood in the 21st century as [[Non-binary gender|genderqueer]], Princess Maru made subsequent Golden Age appearances styled as the male-presenting Doctor Poison, even though her supposedly "true" gender had been revealed. After several clashes with Wonder Woman, she became a member of [[Villainy Inc.]], a team of supervillains consisting of several of Wonder Woman's foes, including the [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Giganta]] and [[Queen Clea]]. 

=== Modern Age ===
{{main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}
After DC Comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 (in a publication event known as the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), Wonder Woman, her supporting characters and many of her foes were re-imagined and reintroduced. A retooled Doctor Poison made her first appearance in this continuity in 1999. Now the unstable granddaughter of the original Princess Maru, she is attired in a still-androgynous dark green leather trench and cowl, paying homage to her grandmother's Golden Age surgical gown. "[The Post-Crisis] Dr. Poison presents a deliberately ghoulish face to the world. Molecularly bonded appliqués peel back her eyelids to achieve a permanent stare. Dental hooks pull her lips into a rictus of revulsion".<ref>Beatty, Scott. ''Wonder Woman: The Ultimate Guide to the Amazon Princess'', DK Publishing, 2003, p. 82.</ref> After several clashes with Wonder Woman, Doctor Poison joined the modern incarnation of Villainy Inc. and attempted to abet Queen Clea, and later the sentient computer virus Trinity, in taking over the other-dimensional realm of [[Skartaris]]. She subsequently joined [[Secret Society of Supervillains|The Secret Society of Supervillains]] and, under the guidance of [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] and in collaboration with fellow Society members the Cheetah, [[Felix Faust]] and [[T.O. Morrow]], created the powerful golem [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] as part of a plot to kill Wonder Woman.<ref>Jimenez, Phil. ''The Essential Wonder Woman Encyclopedia'', Del Rey Books, 2010, p. 156.</ref>

=== 2010s ===
In 2016, a new version of Doctor Poison, a vengeful Russian scientist known only as Dr. Maru, was introduced and briefly battled Wonder Woman before being apprehended. A year later, as part of DC Comics' [[DC Rebirth|Rebirth]] continuity reboot, yet another version of the character was introduced, this time as the Japanese-American mercenary Colonel Marina Maru, a for-hire operative of the vindictive pharmaceutical tycoon [[Veronica Cale]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Princess Maru===
====Golden Age====
Doctor Poison first appeared as the chief of the poison division for a [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] spy band who had planned to contaminate the United States Army's water with "Reverso", a drug that compels whoever takes it to "do the exact opposite of what they are told". She disguised her sex by wearing a bulky hooded costume and a mask. Doctor Poison's underlings captured [[Steve Trevor]] and brought him to their base in America where he was questioned by Doctor Poison. [[Wonder Woman]], disguised as a nurse, aided Steve Trevor but was forced to flee the scene after a lengthy battle. Meanwhile, the Reverso drug was successful in turning thousands of American soldiers against their superiors. Wonder Woman recruited [[Etta Candy]] to help her create a diversion for Doctor Poison's troops, which led to the defeat of the villain. When Wonder Woman pulled her disguise off, she discovered Doctor Poison to be Maru, a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] princess. Maru made one more attempt to defeat the amazon, but was tackled by Etta Candy and coerced into giving up the antidote. She was later taken into police custody.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #2 (1942)</ref>

Later, Princess Maru escaped imprisonment and disguised herself as Mei Sing, a "princess" who worked in a Chinese nightclub. She once again captured Steve Trevor, who couldn't see through her disguise. This led to another encounter with Wonder Woman, whom Maru defeated with an anesthetic gas grenade. Maru had been perfecting a green gas which would clog the carburetors of the US planes. This plan was foiled once again by Wonder Woman.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #24 (1943)</ref>

Instead of placing Maru back in prison, Wonder Woman sentenced her to Transformation Island, the Amazon penal colony where many female criminals were sent to reform. Although the majority of inmates have reformed with loving submission, Maru and seven other women refused to change their ways. The Saturnian slaver [[Eviless]] banded these rebellious super-villains together under the name [[Villainy Inc.]] Maru returned to her Doctor Poison disguise and tricked [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] into believing men had invaded [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]. The villains were able to capture Hippolyta's girdle, which they used to defeat Wonder Woman. Doctor Poison then joined Eviless, [[Blue Snowman]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] on a boat with the captive Wonder Woman, plotting to imprison the Amazon on Transformation Island for revenge. Wonder Woman attempted to escape by turning over the boat, but the four members of Villainy Inc. defeated her once again. After traveling to Transformation Island, Eviless tortured Wonder Woman until the reformed criminal Irene led a mutiny against Villainy Inc. In the ensuing chaos, Wonder Woman and Hippolyta broke free of their chains and managed to defeat Doctor Poison and her three companions.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #28 (1948)</ref>

====Post-Crisis====
After the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Doctor Poison was a founding member of Villainy Inc., but the team was created by [[Queen Clea]] instead of Eviless. As part of Villainy Inc., Doctor Poison battled Hippolyta, the first Wonder Woman, in the 1940s.<ref>''Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War'' #1</ref> It was later revealed by her granddaughter that she had died after creating the Reverso drug, as she accidentally reversed her own growth patterns and had forgotten the antidote by becoming too young too fast, eventually reverting to a fetus and then nothing.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #81</ref>

===Marina Maru===
====Post-Crisis====
The grandchild of the original Doctor Poison, this second incarnation appears in league with the demi-goddess [[Devastation (comics)|Devastation]]. Doctor Poison's sex remains ambiguous, the only clues being long fingernails and a lipsticked grimace. She also joined the second Villainy Inc. and once again battled Wonder Woman. This incarnation of Doctor Poison confirmed that her grandmother did battle [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] as Wonder Woman during World War II. She also explains that her grandmother met her own demise by the creation of the drug called "Reverso". The original Doctor Poison accidentally reversed her own growth patterns and had forgotten the antidote by becoming too young too fast, eventually reverting to a fetus and then nothing.

Doctor Poison is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].

Doctor Poison was later asked to be a part of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], which she accepted. Joining the other scientists on the team, she was assigned to collect soil samples from [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Logor Jasenovac, Croatia]]. She added her samples with that of other areas on Earth where genocide took place and helped create the new Wonder Woman villain [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]]. Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', she was with [[Cheetah (comics)#Barbara Ann Minerva|Cheetah]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

====The New 52====
In September 2011, DC Comics rebooted the continuity of its fictional universe and relaunched all 52 of its monthly books in an endeavor called [[The New 52]]. Here, Doctor Maru is re-introduced as the Caucasian daughter of a Russian pair of scientists renowned for their knowledge of poisons. American spies had approached her parents as they thought the doctors' expertise could lead to the United States' domination in biological weaponry. When they refused, the Russian government discovered their practices. Her parents were branded terrorists by Russia, and imprisoned near [[Siberia]] where they died during interrogations. Doctor Poison blamed the United States for her parents' deaths and planned to take revenge through chemical attacks.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 4 #48 (March 2016)</ref>

====DC Rebirth====
After the events of [[DC Rebirth]], Doctor Poison's history had been altered. In the current continuity, she is Colonel Marina Maru, a Japanese soldier working for the organization called Poison which had been founded by her family.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 5 #13 (December 2016)</ref> During Wonder Woman's first few months in the United States, the Amazon discovered a group of men infected with the Maru Virus, a poison that drives its victims to rage-induced murder.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 5 #12 (December 2016)</ref> Ten years later, after Wonder Woman had discovered she had been living a lie for several years, [[Veronica Cale]] sent Doctor Poison to attack the Amazon.

In the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Doctor Poison is among the villains who attend an underground meeting held by [[Riddler]] that talks about the Superman Theory. Doctor Poison talks about a rumor that the Amazons forcefully took Wonder Woman back to Themyscira.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>

===Film===
* Doctor Poison makes her live-action debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), portrayed by Spanish actress [[Elena Anaya]]. This adaptation's identity is '''Dr. Isabel Maru''', a chemist recruited by General [[Erich Ludendorff]] to create chemical weapons for the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] and nicknamed Doctor Poison. Due to facial disfigurement, she wears a ceramic mask over the left side of her face. It marks the character's first live action appearance, although the setting is [[World War I]] rather than the [[World War II]] setting of the comic books.<ref name="EmpireFeb2016">{{cite news|title=Alpha Female|last=O'Hara|first=Helen|date=April 2017|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|pages=60–67}}</ref> Steve Trevor steals a book of Doctor Maru's notes on her new chemical weapons that would render gas masks useless against them, crash-landing on Themyscira during an escape, which alerts Diana to the current war. Diana initially believes that [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] is directly responsible for the war, acting as or through Ludendorff but later learns that all Ares did was provide a few ideas for the weapons to the likes of Maru while the decision to use the weapons was still the choice of the humans themselves. Ares attempts to sway Diana to his point of view by offering a chance to kill Maru for her sins and part in the war, but Diana rejects this offer as Trevor's sacrifice inspires Diana to recognize and accept humanity for its flaws rather than condemn it for not being perfect. This leads Diana, out of mercy, to spare Maru, who then flees.
