The Park County School District is holding a parent meeting tomorrow, and officials are hopeful that students can return to school on Monday. The openings come on the heels that scientists are getting closer to finding the origins of the COVID pandemic. All over South Park this morning, children are getting ready for their first day of class. And as they do, scientists say they're closer to finding a vaccine. Another strain of COVID, or simply more COVID-related symptoms? A reported 1 in 10 people in Park County are experiencing mustaches, and nobody seems to know why. The Mayor has called for help from infectious disease experts, and Dr. Anthony Fauci arrived at South park Hospital today to give his advice. Citizens are asked to stay indoors and just try and relax, and maybe enjoy some of the Pandemic Special. The new outbreak in South Park is spreading rapidly, and as highways into town close and governments consider a full lockdown, one question is on everyone's mind: where is the damn pangolin?! Some speculate the pangolin took its own life, while others think that-  Sorry. Sorry, we're getting some breaking news. Oh, God. Students at South Park Elementary have broken quarantine and are now out on the loose!
