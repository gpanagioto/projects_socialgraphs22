'''Cassandra''' "'''Cassie'''" '''Sandsmark''', also known as [[Wonder Girl]], is a [[superheroine]] appearing in [[DC Comics]]. She was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and first appeared in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2) #105 (January 1996). The second Wonder Girl, Cassie is a [[sidekick]] of the superheroine [[Wonder Woman]] and has been featured as a member of the [[Teen Titans]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=264}}</ref>

When Cassie was introduced, she was the daughter of an archaeologist, Dr. [[Helena Sandsmark]], a friend of Wonder Woman's. To help Wonder Woman during an adventure, she borrowed magical artifacts which bestowed upon Cassie superpowers, with which she fought crime as Wonder Girl. Later, [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]], king of the Greek gods, grants her real powers. Later revelations showed that Cassie was in fact a [[demigod]]dess and the daughter of Zeus and Dr. Sandsmark.<ref name="ww105">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #105 (1996)</ref> In 2011, when DC [[The New 52|relaunched]] Wonder Woman and revealed she was Zeus's daughter, the publisher [[retcon|retroactively changed]] Cassie's backstory to establish she was actually Zeus's ''granddaughter'', making her Wonder Woman's niece.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 4) #19 (June 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
Cassandra is the third character to be called Wonder Girl, the second being [[Donna Troy]], following the earlier stories of a young [[Wonder Woman]] using the name. Cassandra is the daughter of Dr. [[Helena Sandsmark]] (an archaeologist with whom Wonder Woman was working) and the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Ares]].<ref name="ww105"/> During a fight with a [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday clone]]<ref name="ww111">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #111 (1996)</ref> and another battle with Decay,<ref name="ww113">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #113 (1996)</ref> she created a costume and used magical accoutrements (the sandals of [[Hermes]] and the gauntlet of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]) to help Wonder Woman, much to her mother's horror. Cassandra later had the opportunity to ask Zeus for a boon,<ref name="ww122-123">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #122-123 (1997)</ref> and requested real superpowers. Zeus granted her request, but gave Dr. Sandsmark the ability to deactivate them with the simple touch of her hand upon Cassie. Dr. Sandsmark, however, reluctantly accepted her daughter's wish to be a superhero and rarely if ever uses this ability.

===Young Justice===
{{See also|Young Justice}}
Cassie heavily idolized [[Donna Troy]], the original [[Wonder Girl]], and to that effect wore a black wig over her natural blonde hair (it also helped to conceal her identity). Donna gave Cassie the second costume she wore as Wonder Girl, but Cassie was afraid to wear it lest it were ruined. She has been trained by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], the former "stand-in" Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #142-158</ref> As Wonder Girl, Cassie joined [[Young Justice]]<ref name="yj4">''Young Justice'' #4 (1999)</ref> due to her crush on [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]. She became close friends with [[Arrowette]], [[Secret (Greta Hayes)|Secret]], and [[Empress (comics)|Empress]]. During her time with that group the dark god [[Titans of Myth (comics)#Children of Cronus|Oblivion]] caused Wonder Woman's Wonder Dome palace to destroy Gateway City. Artemis ordered Cassie to help with crowd control instead of wasting time putting on her Wonder Girl disguise. Agreeing with her, Cassie revealed her secret identity before news cameras for the first time in her superhero career.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 2, issues 140 and 141.</ref> Towards the end of the Young Justice series, Cassie became the leader of the team, after beating Robin during an election for command due to inner team tension following the recent revelation of [[Batman]]'s [[JLA: Tower of Babel|security protocols against the rest of the Justice League]], YJ uncomfortable with the idea that Robin had similar plans to use on them. Her secret identity was again publicly revealed when the second [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]] attacked her at her high school.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Young Justice was disbanded after the events of ''[[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day|Graduation Day]]'',<ref name="t/yj">''Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day'' (1999)</ref> a crossover with ''Titans''. During these events, [[List of DC Comics teams and organizations#O|Optitron]] offered to fund both the Titans and Young Justice. Donna Troy was seemingly killed by a rogue [[Superman]] android, leaving Cassie shaken and causing both teams to disband.

===Teen Titans===
{{See also|Teen Titans|Superboy (Kon-El)|Robin (Tim Drake)|Bart Allen}}

Cassie later joined some former members of Young Justice in the newest incarnation of the Teen Titans.<ref name="tt1">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #1 (2003)</ref> Early on, she was gifted with a lasso<ref name="tt2">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #2 (2003)</ref> by [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], the Greek god of war and frequent enemy of Wonder Woman and the Amazons. Despite appearing similar to Wonder Woman's lasso, Cassie's expels Zeus' [[lightning]] when used in anger.<ref name="tt6">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #6 (2003)</ref> Over the course of the series, Ares often appeared to Wonder Girl to warn her about "[[Infinite Crisis|the coming war]]".<ref name="tt2"/><ref name="tt8">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #8 (2003)</ref><ref name="tt15">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #15 (2004)</ref> During her time with the Titans, Cassie also developed a relationship with Superboy, whom she had harbored feelings before and throughout ''Young Justice''.

In "[[Titans Tomorrow]]",<ref name="titanstomorrow">"[[Titans Tomorrow]]": ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #17–19 (2005)</ref> the Titans are thrown ten years into their future, where they encountered future versions of themselves. In this future, Cassie inherited the mantle of Wonder Woman after Diana was killed during "the Crisis". She is also referred to as "Ares' champion", and is in a relationship with [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] ([[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]). It is not revealed whether they are married or merely dating.

It was also during her Titans membership that she was revealed to be Zeus' daughter, a fact both Zeus and her mother kept from her for most of her life. Cassie was originally told by her mother that her biological father had died. Wonder Woman knew about Cassie's link to Zeus but chose to hide this from Cassie as well at the request of Cassie's mother. In "The Insiders",<ref name="insiderstt">"The Insiders": ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #24–25 (2005)</ref><ref name="insidersos">"The Insiders":''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #24–25 (2005)</ref> she was beaten by Superboy as a result of his possession by [[Lex Luthor]]; though she recovered, Superboy secluded himself at the Kent farm in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]],<ref name="tt26">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #26 (2005)</ref><ref name="ic1">''Infinite Crisis'' #1 (2005)</ref><ref name="sg2">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #2 (2005)</ref> and there had seemed to be a strain on their relationship until the events of ''Infinite Crisis''.

When the Teen Titans and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] learned that Donna Troy was still alive in ''The Return of Donna Troy'', Cassie was among the heroes that traveled to the planet Minosyss to reunite with her. Having had false memories implanted by the Titans of Myth, Donna savagely beat Cassie, until Cassie was able to restore her true memories.<ref name="dt">''The Return of Donna Troy'' #3 (2005)</ref>

===Infinite Crisis===

[[Image:titans annual.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) Annual #1<br />Cover art by [[Ed Benes]]]]

Ares again appears to her and informed that the reason behind her weakening power was Zeus taking back the powers he had granted to her as he left the mortal plane.

===The Cult of Conner===
{{See also|52 (comics)}}
Directly after Infinite Crisis, the Teen Titans fall apart. Cassie, feeling abandoned by her best friends, leaves the Titans during the year in which ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' takes place, following Robin's departure. Cassie becomes involved in a cult heavily influenced by [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] culture. She sets up an altar in [[Titans Tower]] with Kryptonian crystals and a gold figure with the Superman-insignia, which means "hope" in Kryptonian. Soon, [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]] approaches her because someone defaced the grave of his wife [[Sue Dibny|Sue]] with an upside down 'S' Shield, which in Kryptonian means "resurrection".

About five days later, Cassie and her fellow cult members meet with Ralph. Cassie mentions that it was another member, [[Dev-Em]], who led her to join. Cassie explains that the goal of the cult is to resurrect Superboy. As a test of their process, they intend to resurrect [[Sue Dibny]]. Cassie and Ralph attend a ceremony designed to resurrect Sue, but Ralph grows suspicious and with the help of other superheroes, disrupts the ceremony, destroying the Kryptonite which was essential to the process. Cassie leaves with Dev-Em, blaming Ralph for destroying her chances to resurrect Superboy. After stopping [[Weather Wizard]] in Metropolis, Cassie meets [[Booster Gold#52 and Supernova|Supernova]] and refers to him incorrectly as Kon-El, who actually turns out to be Booster Gold in disguise.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
During "One Year Later", Wonder Girl is seen attempting to stop [[Gemini (DC Comics)|Gemini]] of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] from escaping [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] with valuable technology, revealing that she had been following the Brotherhood for some time. She also sports a new costume influenced by that of the late Superboy. She now wears a [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Wonder Woman-themed [[t-shirt]] and [[denim]] [[jeans]].<ref name="tt34">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #34 (2006)</ref>

She temporarily rejoins the team,<ref name="tt35">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #35 (2006)</ref> under the suggestion of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] so that they may combine forces to defeat the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. After the Teen Titans and [[Doom Patrol]] defeat the Brotherhood of Evil, she decides to rejoin the team permanently. When she goes to tell Robin of her decision, she discovers his secretive and unsuccessful attempts to bring back Superboy. Though obsessed with having Conner back, Cassie reacts in horror and in an attempt to quell Robin's anger at Cassie, the two kiss. For a while the two refused to talk about the incident beyond coming to the agreement that it was a mistake, but they both have discussed it with others.<ref name="ww4">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #4 (2007)</ref><ref name="sg11">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #11 (2007)</ref><ref name="sg12">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #12 (2007)</ref> With her life in disarray, Cassie has been having difficulty with her personal life, often having major confrontations with her mother. Cassie has gained a new friendship with the recently returned Supergirl, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], who has shared with her in mourning the loss of Superboy and Paradise Island.<ref name="sg10">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #10 (2006)</ref>

Cassie was also still very furious at Wonder Woman following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', due to her belief that Wonder Woman abandoned her after Conner's death to play secret agent in a new civilian identity that [[Batman]] created for her after Infinite Crisis. She was also not pleased that Robin was aware of Diana's whereabouts during the year after Infinite Crisis and did not inform her about it. Diana and Cassie have not been able to discuss their past differences, leading to Cassie to turn to Supergirl and the now resurrected [[Donna Troy]] instead for emotional support dealing with Conner's death.

Following the resurrection of [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] at the hands of Raven, Wonder Girl and Robin request that Raven use the same ceremony to resurrect Superboy. Raven calmly explains that is not possible, because Jericho's resurrection was a special case: Jericho's soul was still on Earth, imprisoned inside of a computer disk, while Conner's has moved on to the afterlife. In the middle of this conversation with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], Wonder Girl is captured by [[Deathstroke]]'s villainous [[Titans East]] after an attack by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and [[Match (DC Comics)|Match]]. Each member of Titans East has been recruited to negate a specific Titan. Deathstroke selected Match, a Bizarro-type clone of Superboy, to counter Wonder Girl due to his strength and his warped visage as being a psychological edge against her.<ref name="tt43">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #43 (2007)</ref>

The Titans battle furiously against the Titans East, during which they are able to convince [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]] and [[Duela Dent]] to switch sides. Unfortunately the team is defeated by Slade's team a second time. However, Raven, Cyborg, and Duela Dent manage to get aid from [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], Donna Troy, [[Beast Boy]], and Flash (Bart Allen). Together the Titans defeat Slade, who along with Inertia, manages to escape. During the fight Jericho possess Match, and the team is reluctant to release Match due to the danger he poses.

In the ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' limited series, Cassie attends [[Bart Allen]]'s funeral and during a heated and controversial eulogy, she vows to get revenge for Bart's death.

Cassie then becomes involved in the [[Amazons Attack!|Amazon's attack on Washington D.C.]] Supergirl and Wonder Girl discover that their friends and family have been placed in an internment camp due to their ties to the Amazons. After a failed attempt to aid them, the two heroes agree to bring the U.S. President to [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] in order to stop the war. They are ambushed by a group of Amazons in the process, which causes the President to become mortally wounded. The actions of the Amazons and Wonder Girl's own involvement cause public outcry against all those who have followed in Wonder Woman's footsteps. Ultimately Cassie declares that despite her training and past that she is not an Amazon, preferring her ties to the Teen Titans over that of the Amazons.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #49</ref> Accepting her decision, [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] wishes her well and leaves Cassie to her devices. Wonder Girl celebrates by sharing another kiss with Robin in front of her teammates.

In the months following the kiss, Cassie and Tim continue to go through 'will-they-won't-they' moments in which they both continue to question the validity of their relationship.{{Issue|date=October 2008}} Then following a battle against an army of future Titans, the pair decided at last to date. Unfortunately, their relationship is short-lived, as after their first official date Cassie ends the relationship, because she feels she is using Tim.<ref name="tt55">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #55 (2008)</ref> This has resulted in a growing animosity between the pair, which has begun to bleed into their relationships with the other Titans.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}

====''Huntress''====
[[Image:ArmoredCassie.jpg|thumb|right|Cassie in her Amazon armor.<br />Art by [[Aaron Lopresti]].]]Wonder Girl recently appeared in a six-issue self-titled mini-series written by [[J. Torres]] and with art and covers by Sanford Greene and [[Nathan Massengill]]. In this series, Wonder Girl attempts to make up for the mistakes made by the Amazons on her own. Cassie adopts a secret identity, taking up the name "Drusilla" (the same name used by Wonder Girl in the '70s [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|''Wonder Woman'' television series]]). However, as she attempts to apprehend a group of mystical beasts left over from the Amazons' attack, she finds herself confronted by her half-brother [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], who claims to want to help her become a true champion of the gods and to rebuild Olympus. Cassie is reluctant to trust him. Hercules persists and chases after Cassie, taking the form of Superboy in order to get her attention.

Together, Hercules and Cassie try to discover who is attacking the remaining Olympian gods. Soon into their search they are attacked by the [[Female Furies]]. Hercules stops the fight by explaining that he has allied with the Furies in hopes of rescuing the gods, or, failing that, starting a new pantheon with them. The Furies have their own plans and are only using Hercules to get to Wonder Girl. The Furies soon betray Hercules, with [[Bloody Mary (DC Comics)|Bloody Mary]] using her bite to gain power over Hercules, forcing him to do what the Furies want. The Furies then kidnap Cassie's mother to lure her into a trap. Aided by the [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]], Wonder Girl goes into battle, being forced to fight her own brother. The Teen Titans, Empress, Arrowette and Wonder Woman show up to help. After Bloody Mary is murdered by the [[New Gods|New Gods killer]], Hercules is freed from her spell and immediately saves Wonder Girl from being kidnapped by the Furies. Hercules goes free after he reveals he is now a demi-god and that Zeus released him to help stop "[[Countdown to Final Crisis|the Great Disaster]]". Hercules then leaves to perform certain "labors".

The series ends with Cassie reconciling with Wonder Woman, who tells Cassie that she has become her own woman.

Cassie is later attacked by her nephew [[Lycus (DC Comics)|Lycus]], the son of Ares. He attempts to take her title as Ares' avatar, along with her power. Although he is successful in stealing Cassie's powers derived from Ares, Cassie discovers that she no longer needs to be blessed with powers from the gods as she willed her own innate power to surface. Cassie now possesses a high level of super-strength all her own.

Robin ultimately makes the decision to leave the Teen Titans for an undetermined length of time in the aftermath of [[Batman R.I.P]], leaving Cassie with the task of assembling and leading a new team. After an unsuccessful attempt at having Kid Devil recruit teen metahumans such as [[Klarion]], [[Shining Knight]], and the teen members of the [[Justice Society of America]], Cassie eventually gains three new Titans in [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], [[Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)|Aquagirl]], and [[Kid Eternity]]. Kid Eternity's ability to summon the spirits of the deceased briefly tempts Cassie, who considers having him summon Conner's spirit. However, she eventually decides against it, telling Eternity never to grant her such a request, even if she were to beg him.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #71</ref>

Some months later, between the [[Final Crisis]] and the [[Blackest Night]], Cassie becomes aware of Conner's rebirth by [[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Brainiac 5's hand]]. Despite meeting him briefly at his return,<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #5 (2009)</ref> Cassie decides to wait, until [[Ma and Pa Kent|Martha Kent]] herself, now sheltering Conner at her place, invites Cassie for dinner, essentially granting Cassie and Conner a date. At first skeptical and fearing to ''end as [[Lana Lang]]'', basically forgotten and replaced as Conner relocated to Smallville and gained a new circle of friends, she's touched by Conner opening his heart to her about her fears and dreams for their future life, and thus decides to tell Conner about herself and Tim Drake. Conner quickly forgives her, arguing that even if Cassie still loves him, she could not have known of his impending resurrection in the immediate aftermath of the Infinite Crisis, so she has nothing to blame. Happily, Cassie accepts to rekindle their relationship.<ref name="Adv2">''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #2 (September 2009)</ref>

Due to personal responsibilities, neither Conner nor Bart return to the Teen Titans, though Wonder Girl still continues to lead. However, following the demise of [[Kid Devil]], Cassie begins questioning her leadership and begins to make mistakes. During a massive battle with [[Cinderblock (comics)|Cinderblock]]  in downtown San Francisco, Wonder Girl refuses to let her team attack the villain directly, causing massive destruction to the area. The heroes continue in their fruitless stalemate until Beast Boy arrives and takes command of the team, leading to their victory. In the aftermath of the battle, Beast Boy tells Cassie that she has to stop dwelling on Devil's death or else more innocent people are going to get hurt, something she does not take kindly.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #17 (August 2009)</ref>

A few days later, Beast Boy makes the decision to move back into Titans Tower and replace Cassie as the head of the team, declaring that they need a more experienced leader to get back on track. Though Cassie initially says nothing about this, she ultimately becomes angry and tells Beast Boy that no one asked for his help, and that she can lead the team just fine. Beast Boy simply replies by saying that the Teen Titans need help, and that everyone, including Cyborg, think so.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #75-76 (September–October 2009)</ref>

===Blackest Night===
During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Cassie joins Kid Flash and Beast Boy as part of a small group of past and present Titans who assemble at Titans Tower. Lacking assistance from Static, Miss Martian, Blue Beetle, [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]], and Aquagirl (each of whom are presumably defending other cities), the team barely survives the onslaught.<ref>''Blackest Night: Titans'' #1-3</ref>

After [[Dawn Granger]] uses her abilities to destroy the Black Lanterns, Cassie and the others travel to [[Coast City]] in order to assist [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] in their battle with [[Nekron]], the leader of the Black Lantern Corps. To the horror of the gathered heroes, Nekron uses his abilities to transform several once-dead heroes into Black Lanterns, including Superboy, Kid Flash, Donna, and Wonder Woman.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (November 2009)</ref> In the ensuing battle, Cassie is killed when Donna Troy violently tears her heart out. However, it is then revealed that the entire battle was an imagination of Wonder Woman, and Cassie is shown to still be alive.<ref>''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> When Black Lantern Conner attacks Cassie, all the while attempting to break free from the Black Ring's control, Conner manages to break the control in temporary, short lapses, which he uses to alert Cassie about the solution to his Black Ring problem. The battle moves to the fortress, where Cassie realizes what Conner was referring to when he told them to move to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] Conner's corpse, placed where he awaits his resurrection in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Legion of Three Worlds]]''. The Black Ring, confused, leaves the living Conner and tries to attach itself to his corpse, but Conner awakens his freeze breath ability, which freezes the ring, and Cassie throws it into orbit. After reconciling, the pair heads back to Coast City for the final battle with Nekron's army.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #7 (February 2010)</ref>

===Return of Conner===
After this, Cassie travels to New York to confront Cyborg about Beast Boy's statements. He assures her that she is capable of leading the Titans, and she returns to the team and admits to them that she is done moping over Conner and Eddie. She then leads the team to the city of Dakota in order to rescue Static, who had been kidnapped by a superhuman gangster named [[Holocaust (DC Comics)|Holocaust]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #79 (January 2010)</ref> After hearing about a battle between Static and Holocaust in downtown Dakota, Cassie arrives on the scene with Bombshell and Aquagirl. The three heroines are easily defeated and captured by Holocaust, who then informs them that he plans on killing them and weaponizing their powers in order to sell. Beast Boy and the other Titans arrive at the compound to retrieve their comrades, but end up being overpowered and defeated themselves. At the last second, Cyborg bursts into the compound with Superboy and Kid Flash, preparing to rescue the other Titans.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #80-81</ref> Cassie is soon freed, and assists Superboy in holding off Holocaust while the other Titans make their escape. In the final battle, Cassie uses her lasso to bind the villain, allowing Kid Flash to finish him off by sending him plummeting into the Earth's inner core (though thanks to his superhuman durability, Static remarks that the core would not kill him). On the plane ride back to San Francisco, Conner remarks that Cassie seems to be ignoring him, and she simply responds by telling him that he is correct.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #82</ref>

Cassie later travels to Gotham City alongside several of her fellow Titans after [[Ra's al Ghul]] begins targeting people close to Tim Drake. She attempts to rescue [[Barbara Gordon]] from members of the [[League of Assassins]], but arrives to find that she has already defeated the men that attempted to kill her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/04/rrob_12_dylux-5-copy.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026180144/http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/04/rrob_12_dylux-5-copy.jpg |archive-date=2011-10-26}}</ref>

During the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', Cassie confronts a recently resurrected Titan by the name of [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Amon Tomaz|Osiris]] when he arrives at Titans Tower, looking for help from his former teammates. Cassie tries to convince Osiris to turn himself over to the police for the murdering the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]] during ''52'', but he angrily brushes her off and flees before Cassie can contact the authorities. [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]] asks if the Titans should go after him, but Cassie simply replies by saying that Osiris will return, and then rhetorically asks, "[[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans – Villains for Hire|where else can he go?]]"<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24</ref>

After a disastrous mission to another dimension in order to rescue Raven, the Titans are torn asunder. Miss Martian is rendered comatose, Static is left temporarily depowered, and Aquagirl and Bombshell are missing and presumed dead at sea. Despite her pleas for Static to stay, Wonder Girl is ultimately left with a roster consisting of only herself, Superboy, Kid Flash, Raven, and Beast Boy.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #87</ref> A short time after this, the Titans rescue Bombshell and Aquagirl, who are both removed from the team by Wonder Girl. When asked about this decision (as well as the subsequent choice to invite the unstable [[Rose Wilson]] back into the team), Wonder Girl states that Kid Devil's death has forced her to realize that inexperienced teen heroes have no place on the team. At the same time, she admits to Conner that she is having trouble reconciling her knowledge as a leader with her fear of losing him again.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #88</ref>

{{Update|date=February 2012}}

===The New 52===
{{Update|date=August 2017}}
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Cassie Sandsmark is reintroduced in the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' series. This version of Cassie, who dislikes being called "Wonder Girl", started out as a teenage thief, who started at the age of sixteen and lost touch with her mother, who stole a pair of enchanted bracelets from a temple before meeting [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. Living in Hollywood surviving on a crime spree and bought a little house with the money she made. She first crossed paths with Red Robin after she was rescued from an organization called N.O.W.H.E.R.E, who were capturing young teenagers who were developing [[metahuman]] abilities for their own nefarious purposes. She caught the organization's attention when her exploits were attaching attention her from the media which they dubbed her "Wonder Girl". She stole a car but was later pulled by a police officer in the Pacific Coast Highway, the latter was revealed to be an agent of N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and tried to capture her but Red Robin intervened. Red Robin was tracking down N.O.W.H.E.R.E and news coverage of teenagers with abilities and their actions in a lecture by Lex Luther about aliens on earth.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 4) #2</ref> She is later revealed to be the daughter of Helen, an archaeologist who reputation was destroyed when Cassie stole the bracelets which resulted in the death of one of Helen's colleagues, who was Cassandra's one time love interest and mentor in stealing, and Lennox Sandsmark, a British super-soldier, who left the family when Cassie was only four years old.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 4) #13 (December 2012)</ref> As Lennox is a demigod son of Zeus, and also a half-brother of Wonder Woman, Cassie, for the first time, is related to Wonder Woman.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 4) #19 (June 2013)</ref>

===Rebirth===
In the Super Sons of Tomorrow crossover, the version of Cassie Sandmark from the Titans Tomorrow future briefly arrived in the present timeline of Rebirth alongside other members of the Titans of Tomorrow.

In [[Young Justice]] #2, Zeus refers to Cassie as "the future of the pantheon of the gods". As part of her birthright, Zeus offers her a necklace that is said to contain immense powers. However, Cassie decides to hold off on taking this gift until she does something to truly earn it. Zeus calls her a "giant pain, just like her mother".

==Powers and abilities==
Cassandra originally received her powers from a number of mystical artifacts employed by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] during her time as Wonder Woman. These included the Gauntlet of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and the Sandals of [[Hermes]], which provided her with the powers of strength and speed/flight, respectively.<ref name="ww111"/> She was eventually granted similar abilities by [[Zeus]] as "her fondest wish".<ref name="ww122-123" /> Discouraged by previously shown arrogance in his children ([[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] and [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]]), Zeus also blessed Cassandra's mother with the ability to take away her powers for a short time via a simple touch.<ref name="ww122-123"/>

Shortly after joining the Teen Titans, Ares approached her and gave Cassandra her own magic lasso.<ref name="tt2"/> Unlike Wonder Woman's [[Lasso of Truth]], Cassandra's is a weapon which channels Zeus' lightning when she becomes angry.<ref name="tt6"/> When the Greek gods left the mortal plane as a result of the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', taking Cassandra's powers along with them, Ares offered her some of his power, saying that she would be "more powerful than [she's] ever been". What this entails is not made entirely clear, though she appeared to have retained all of her former abilities.<ref name="ic6"/><ref name="tt34"/> In a storyline taking place "[[One Year Later]]", Cassie was shown catching a falling [[Jet aircraft|jet]], which she was surprised at being able to accomplish.<ref name="tt40">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #40 (2006)</ref> However, while trying to stop the military from detaining her mother, Ares causes her powers to fluctuate when he believes she is wasting them on frivolous matters.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}

In the end, Ares was not pleased with Cassandra as his champion. He returned another to take her place. During a battle with Ares' son, King Lycus, who also drew power from him, Cassie was able to cast away her connection to the war god, and tap into her own powers as a demi-god (like her brother Heracles). Her real powers increased to an even greater level of strength than before. Currently, having tapped into her own demi-goddess powers, Cassie is an Olympian powerhouse. Although she is not as powerful as Wonder Woman or Donna Troy, Cassie is still a powerful young woman. Her lasso has apparently also changed, enabling her to turn Lycus to dust with a simple order.

Cassie was trained by the Amazon Artemis and is extremely well trained in the use of various weapons and in various martial arts. She is also a very capable leader and strategist.

After the New 52 reboot, Cassie's powers have changed yet again. Her powers are now derived from the [[Silent Armor]] that she wears, which was forged in the heart of a sun and is apparently related to the demon known as Trigon. The armor is invisible unless she summons it or is in a combat situation, but she is always able to use its powers. The armor usually appears as a glittering red bodysuit, golden gauntlets and, occasionally, a hood. The armor grants her powers similar to those of her pre-reboot counterpart such as superhuman strength (sufficient enough for her to be on par with Superboy and fight him for a while), durability (though she is still vulnerable to piercing weapons), superhuman reflexes, superhuman speed, superhuman senses, and the power to fly at high speeds. The armor also grants her a glowing red lasso that appears similar to barbed wire. The lasso is infinite in length, is virtually indestructible, and can drain the life force out of those wrapped in its confines. Cassie's armor also appears to have a mind of its own and has taken over her mind and body on a few occasions. It was later revealed that Cassie has divine heritage as well, as her father was revealed to be Wonder Woman's elder brother Lennox. Cassie discovered she was the granddaughter of Zeus and that she still had her powers even without the Silent Armor. Because of her divine heritage, she was able to resist the Silent Armor’s influence.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #65''</ref>

==Other versions==
* Cassie played a central role in issue #54 of the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (2004 comic series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic. She was the head of her high school's Wonder Woman fan club and had repeatedly tried to get the superhero to visit her school. Her obsession led her to steal two mystical artifacts that granted her superpowers, after which she barged into an athletic tournament on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]. This event was set up by [[Donna Troy]] to see which of the world's young female heroes might be able to replace her as Wonder Woman's partner. Cassie initially planned to defeat Donna one-on-one, but wound up saving her from an invasion by the undersea villain Trident instead. At the issue's end, Donna offered Cassie a chance to join the Titans' worldwide training program, once her mother was through punishing her for stealing the artifacts. She made a brief appearance in issue #55, sucker-punching Cyborg in his dreams.
* Cassie also has a recurring role on the ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' comic by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani. In the first issue, she is ridiculed by her cousin [[Donna Troy]], [[Dick Grayson]], [[Cyborg (comics)]], and [[Kid Flash]] for wearing a [[T-shirt]] and jeans instead of a skirt with stars. However, when she returns, wearing a skirt with stars and a helmet, she finds the boys all wearing T-shirts and jeans. Her response to this is: "What? I did it first, y'know!"<ref>''Tiny Titans'' #1</ref>
* In the comic tie-in to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Cassie is with the Titans when the Joker's nuclear bomb goes off. Her attire is similar to that of Wonder Woman's in the game. She is sent to spy on Conner after he is devastated by Superman's actions to see what he's up to, and finds him at the Fortress of Solitude trying to find the Phantom Zone Projector. She and the other Titans try to help Conner stop Superman, but Superman mortally wounds him. She and the Titans are sent to the Phantom Zone by Superman to save Conner's life and to stop them from interfering with Superman's plans. In the prequel to ''Injustice 2'', they are freed from the Phantom Zone thanks to the Insurgency. As evidenced during their fight with Amazo, her relationship to her mentor, Wonder Woman, is strained due to the latter allying with the Regime (though Diana is still concerned for Cassie's well-being and had no idea about Superman sending the Titans to the Phantom Zone).

==In other media==

===Television===
* In the episode "Paradise Lost" from the first season of the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, Wonder Woman saves a young blonde girl from a tree. When Wonder Woman returns the girl to her mother, the mother calls the girl "Cassie". This is an obvious reference to Cassie Sandsmark from the comics.
* Wonder Girl appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'' episode "Happy New Year", voiced by [[Mae Whitman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksitetv.com/young-justice/young-justice-interview-greg-weisman-brandon-vietti-talk-saturdays-season-premiere/13884|title=Young Justice Interview: Greg Weisman & Brandon Vietti Talk Saturday's Season Premiere - KSiteTV|date=26 April 2012|access-date=13 October 2014}}</ref> She is introduced as a member of [[Young Justice|the Team]]'s Beta Squad alongside [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] where they first appear to fight [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] who was targeting U.N. Secretary General Tseng (who was actually an alien in disguise). In "Alienated" Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman were part of Delta Squad during the mission to stop the Kroloteans on Malina Island. While they were fighting, Wonder Girl was being a fangirl over her mentor, and Wonder Woman herself called her out on it. They both took out multiple Mechs. When they learned the base was set to explode, she and the team retreated to the Bio-Ship. In "Beneath" she, [[Miss Martian]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], and Batgirl liberated a group of abductees guarded by [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Jr.]], Devastation, [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]], and [[Psimon]] in Bialya. In "Before the Dawn", Wonder Girl and Alpha Squad followed a Manta-Flyer from Star City to the Reach's headquarters to rescue their captured teammates and other abductees. The operation was cut short by a Reach enforcer, who Wonder Girl dubbed as "[[Black Beetle (DC Comics)|Black Beetle]]". As he overpowered and easily defeated the team one by one, Cassie contacted the other heroes for help. Black Beetle pinned her against the door, and mercilessly slammed her into it repeatedly until she was down. Blue Beetle, [[Beast Boy]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] arrived. While Blue Beetle held off the Black Beetle, Impulse and Beast Boy helped the team aboard the Bio-Ship and escaped. Wonder Girl and [[Tim Drake]] became a couple shortly after the Reach invasion concluded. Wally West's death was the catalyst in giving Wonder Girl the courage to kiss him. In the ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders|third season]]'', she tries patch things up with Tim Drake after he leaves the Team and becomes a member of the Batman Inc. Later in the season, she helps found the Outsiders (alongside Beast Boy, Blue Beetle, Static, Geo-Force, and Bart Allen). She returns in Season 4, becoming more of a leader after Beast Boy suffers a severe bout of depression as a result of Superboy's presumed death.
