I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow. Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop. I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time. Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different. You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you. You can't treat people like this! 
Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch ''Grey's Anatomy''? 
Hey, Brian, look! I was just elected President. Right.
