What the fuck?! It wasn't a bear!  It was at my house. There was a... thing. It attacked my uncle and took his friend. It was like a bear, but a pig... thing. It was at my house, and then here at the school! Everyone says that kid and I looked alike. What if that thing is after me?? Keep looking. There's a lot of people saying they saw it, Kyle. It's not just me. It's not a conspiracy, it's real. Keep going down. There's video.  I saw ManBearPig. Don't you remember, dude? We were warned about this. That weirdo guy who came and told us this would happen? He was right.  But it wasn't you guys. Who was that ex-President guy? The one who showed up and tried to convince everyone of a ManBearPig? Hello, uh, we're looking for a government sort of guy named Al Gore? Mr. Gore? Al Gore? I don't know if you remember us, but we're the kids you got to help try and capture ManBearPig? Well uh, eh eh, you were right. Ha, you, you were totally right. ManBearPig is real and, uh, he's killing lots of people in our town. There has to be something we can still do. Please, Mr. Gore. You're the only person who knows anything about it. We, didn't, we didn't realize there were more than- Yu-you told us to do all this. We know how. Where did ManBearPig come from? Why did the Devil send ManBearPig?! He was right before. All right all right, that's enough!  Oh shit!  God damn it! Nothing! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Making deals? That's gonna be impossible! Everyone, listen! ManBearPig is real! It's a demon that thrives on making deals to exploit mankind's weaknesses. I am super-duper cereal. We all have to work together, you guys. This one time. We have to all put our pride aside and be willing to say, maybe we were wrong. No! Nooo! Please! Somebody made a deal with ManBearPig! We have to find out who!
