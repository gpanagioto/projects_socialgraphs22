The character of Fah lo Suee was created in 1917 by [[Sax Rohmer]] as '''the Lady of the Si-Fan''' in the novel ''The Hand of Fu-Manchu'' (original UK title: The Si-Fan Mysteries). In the novel ''Daughter of Fu Manchu'' (1931), she is called Fah lo Suee, a nickname meaning "Sweet Perfume". Fah Lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, frequently plotting to usurp her father's position in the ''Si-Fan'' and aiding his enemies both within and outside the organization.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fah Lo Suee (Daughter of Fu Manchu) |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/fahlosue.htm |access-date=2022-06-01 |website=The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe}}</ref>  In the early 1970s, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]] approached [[DC Comics]] to adapt the television series ''[[Kung Fu (1972 TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' into a comic book, as DC's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], owned the rights to the series. DC Comics, however, was not interested in their pitch, believing the show's and the [[martial arts]] genre popularity would phase out quickly. The duo then approached [[Marvel Comics]] with the idea to create a [[kung fu]]-focused original comic. Editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] agreed, but only if they would include the [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp villain [[Dr. Fu Manchu]], as Marvel had previously acquired the comic book rights to the character.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inside Shang-Chi's evolution from forgotten comic book character to big-screen superhero |url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/09/04/entertainment/shang-chi-marvel-comics-history-cec/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=March 3, 2001 |title=A success written in the stars |url=https://universohq.com/english/jim-starlin-success-written-stars/ |access-date=September 8, 2021 |publisher=[[Universo HQ]]}}</ref> Englehart and Starlin developed [[Shang-Chi]], a master of kung fu and a previously unknown son of Dr. Fu Manchu.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanderson |first1=Peter |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0756641238 |location=London, United Kingdom |page=161 |chapter=1970s |quote=Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer Steve Englehart and artist/co-plotter Jim Starlin created Marvel's ''Master of Kung Fu'' series.

==History==

Born many decades ago as the daughter of the criminal mastermind [[Zheng Zu|Fu Manchu]], Fah Lo Suee originally followed in her father's footsteps. Eventually, Fah Lo Suee became disillusioned by her father's misguided idealism for world conquest and developed a more pragmatic mindset. After obtaining her own faction of Fu Manchu's [[Five Weapons Society|Si-Fan assassins]], Fah Lo Suee would attempt to sway [[Shang-Chi]] into helping her usurp their father from his criminal empire, only to be rebuffed by her heroic half-brother.  Fah Lo Suee would eventually lead her own criminal organization, the Oriental Expeditors, who were a front for the Golden Daggers sect.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #44. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Shang-Chi and his allies bring down the Golden Daggers, she briefly allies herself with them to help take down Fu Manchu.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #47. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After collaborating with [[British intelligence agencies|British Intelligence]], Fah Loh Suee was eventually placed as a director of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI-6]]. Her endeavors perpetually placed her at odds with Shang-Chi and his fellow MI-6 agents. Years later, she once again became involved in the criminal underworld. Now going by the name the '''Cursed Lotus''', she headed a narcotics empire supplying a highly addictive drug, Wild Tiger, with the Wild Tiger mob led by Deng Ling-Xiao, acting as a front for her in [[Hong Kong]]. Despite the Wild Tiger mob being brought down by Shang-Chi, she eludes capture.  Shang-Chi never discovers his half-sister's involvement.<ref name=":4">''Journey into Mystery'' #515-516.

Zheng Bao Yu is recruited by Caroline le Fay, the daughter of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgana le Fey]] and [[Doctor Doom]], into Caroline's incarnation of the Doom Maidens. Now in full control of Zheng Zu's Hai Dai assassins (formerly called Si-Fan), she resumes her father's long-forgotten experiment of bio-engineering [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] eggs as weapons. The Brood hatchlings from the eggs are used to carry out hits in New York's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] by the Ghost Boys gang at the behest of Bao Yu. The plot is uncovered by [[Misty Knight]] and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Annabelle Riggs]] of the [[Fearless Defenders]] with help from [[Elsa Bloodstone]]; the three track Bao Yu and her Hai Dai assassins and scientists to an underground laboratory (where Bao Yu reveals her real name to the group). With the help of No-Name of the Brood, the Fearless Defenders defeat the [[Five Weapons Society|Hai-Da]]<nowiki/>i and destroy the experiments, forcing Bao Yu to teleport away from her lair; she later confronts Caroline for not providing her with enough protection.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Bunn, Cullen |artist=Sliney, Will |colorist=Gandini, Veronica |letterer=Cowles, Clayton |editor=Pyle, Ellie |title=The Fearless Defenders |volume= |issue=#8 |date=Aug. 2013 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Bao Yu joins Caroline and the other Doom Maidens for a ritual to grant Caroline the powers she has been craving. The ritual is interrupted by the Fearless Defenders, who defeat Bao Yu and the other Doom Maidens in the subsequent battle, with [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Frankie Raye]] siphoning the energy from the ritual, preventing Caroline from completing her transformation. However, Caroline still manages to succeed in the secondary ritual of restoring her mother, Morgana le Fey.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Bunn, Cullen |artist=Sliney, Will |colorist=Gandini, Veronica |letterer=Cowles, Clayton |editor=Pyle, Ellie |title=The Fearless Defenders |volume= |issue=#12 |date=Dec. 2013 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Zheng Bao Yu possesses superhuman longevity, due to her consumption of the [[Elixir of Life|Elixir Vitae]]. Much like her father, she is a devious and cunning criminal mastermind and is a genius in most fields of knowledge, including [[alchemy]] and sorcery. As with her half-brother and father, she is also an expert hand-to-hand combatant. Bao Yu is also hypnotically seductive: her voice and movements command attention, and her eyes can entrance a man in moments. She has easily manipulated a variety of men into falling in love with her, devoted to serving her wishes. She occasionally uses scented vapors or hypnotic rubies to further enhance her skills.
