Randy, do you mind cleaning out the garage like I asked? Ach.  YOUR Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups are in that cupboard. I don't know where YOU put them, Randy. YOU were stoked on Columbus, Randy. Not me. I actually was a little upset that you dressed up as Columbus for our wedding, but I decided- I have not.  Randy, why don't you just admit to people that maybe you were somewhat overly excited about Columbus in the past? What?? I'm doing something.
