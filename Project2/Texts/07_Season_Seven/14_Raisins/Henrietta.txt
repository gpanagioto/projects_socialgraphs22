My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school. Whoa. Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades." Go away Mom! Leave me alone! You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face. Conformist bitch. For sure. Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
