'''Ghaur''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ɔr}}) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. In the [[Marvel Universe]], he is the head of the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant race]]'s [[priesthood]].

== Publication history ==
Created by [[Peter B. Gillis]] and [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared in ''[[Eternals (comics)|The Eternals]]'' vol. 2 #2 (Nov. 1985).

==Fictional character biography==
Ghaur was born in the "City of Toads" in [[Deviants (comics)|Deviant]] [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]]. He grew up to become a high priest in the Deviant priesthood, but had ambition to be much more. He had Ranar the Deviant killed when Ranar claimed succession to the Deviant throne. Ghaur became the unofficial leader of the Deviants. He had a confrontation with Warlord [[Kro (comics)|Kro]], whom Ghaur allowed to become a figurehead monarch.<ref>''The Eternals'' vol. 2 #2</ref> Ghaur captured Kro, and the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] [[Thena]] and [[Sersi]]. He revealed to Kro that he had amassed an army of Deviants in suspended animation.  Ghaur used a vial containing part of the "essence" of the "[[Dreaming Celestial]]" to transform himself into a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. However, Ghaur fell under the mental control of the Dreaming Celestial, who forced Ghaur to try to free him from his tomb. Ghaur's consciousness was separated from his Celestial body by a [[Uni-Mind]] composed of the Eternals and the [[West Coast Avengers]]. Ghaur's consciousness seemingly dissipated, and Ghaur's Celestial body shrank into apparent nothingness.<ref>''The Eternals'' vol. 2 #9-12</ref>

Ghaur later tricked the [[Silver Surfer]] into re-creating his physical form. Ghaur battled the Silver Surfer and freed the [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemurian]] [[supervillainess]] [[Llyra]] from captivity. Ghaur formed an alliance with Llyra to recreate the [[Serpent Crown]].  They formed an alliance with [[Attuma]], and freed [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]] from the body of the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]. Ghaur and Llyra caused the devastation of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] as a sacrifice to [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] [[god]] Set. Ghaur and Llyra assembled the seven "Brides of Set," and used them to bring Set to Earth. They were thwarted by a [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]-possessed [[Atum (comics)|Demogorge]].  Ghaur sought to slay the "Brides" to bring Set back to Earth, but was foiled by [[Naga (Marvel Comics)|Naga]].<ref>In the 1989 ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]]: ''Silver Surfer'' Annual #2; ''Iron Man'' Annual #10; ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #23; ''The New Mutants'' Annual #5; ''X-Factor'' Annual #4; ''Web of Spider-Man'' Annual #5; ''Avengers West Coast'' Annual #4; ''Thor'' Annual #14; ''Fantastic Four'' Annual #22</ref>

Later, Kro led a group of heroic Deviants known as the Delta Network to rescue the Avengers from a resurrected Ghaur, who used his powers to control the deviants once more.<ref>''The Avengers'' #370-371. (1995) Marvel Comics.</ref> Ghaur and the Deviants fought the Eternals and the [[Heroes for Hire]] when the mad priest crested an ''Anti-mind'' in his plan to rule the world and defy the Celestials. Despite the destruction of infrastructure, Ghaur remained as the leader of the Deviants and kept the ability to create an Anti-Mind.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #5-7. (1997) Marvel Comics.</ref> Kro and Ghaur formed bickering factions and kept the struggle for power in Deviant Lemuria. The external world didn't know who was in charge. Ghaur threatened [[Wakanda]] with war if a Deviant child was not returned to Lemuria custody. In the aftermath of the diplomatic crisis, it was revealed that the child was Ghaur's daughter and that he was feeling threatened in his position as Priestlord because his daughter was a Reject, a human-like child. The child was declared officially dead, and continued to live in Wakanda.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #26-29. (2001) Marvel Comics.</ref>

Much later, the Deviants males were rendered sterile by a plague and a power contest between [[Ereshkigal (Marvel Comics)|Ereshkigal]] and Ghaur happened. Ghaur won when he promised the deviants the return of the fertility with the help of the kidnapped Eternal [[Phastos]]. The Asgardian god Thor rescued Phastos and battled Ghaur. When the Unbiding stone was destroyed, Ghaur and Ereshkigal disappeared and Kro was left leading the Deviants.<ref>''Thor: the Deviants Saga'' #1-5 (2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ghaur is the result of crossbreeding of his forebearers supervised by Deviant priests trained in genetics over centuries. His [[superhuman]] powers include the psionic ability to manipulate the minds and actions of any other Deviant whose genetic code is known to him. Since he also has a [[eidetic memory|photographic memory]], that effectively means every Deviant in existence, with the sole exception of the [[Kro (comics)|Warlord Kro]] and [[Ransak the Reject]].

Ghaur has a gifted intellect, and is a master politician and cunning strategist.

Deviant scientists have supplied him with "Brain Mines", which can render even an Eternal unconscious, bracelets containing cybernetic circuitry which paralyze the wearer's will (turning the wearer into a slave), and various Deviant vehicles.

Ghaur briefly possessed the body and attributes of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]],{{issue|date=October 2021}} but lost most of those powers upon returning to his original form.{{issue|date=October 2021}} He retained a degree of superhuman strength and durability, the ability to survive without oxygen, and low level energy manipulation powers for a short time but then lost these superhuman powers entirely.
