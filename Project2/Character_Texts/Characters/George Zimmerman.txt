Good morning, girls.  And how did I get such a beautiful wife? I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally. What do you need from me?  I gave that up. Damnit, I have a wife and kids now. Something's wrong.  Are you guys okay? More needless violence. That may be true, but I'll have to live with this the rest of my life. Even though I'll be walking around a free man. Wait, what?
