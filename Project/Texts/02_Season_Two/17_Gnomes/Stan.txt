That's okay with us.  Oh, not Tweek. Dude, we can't work with this kid. No. Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so-- Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. Great. A lot of help you are, kid. What? What gnomes? Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes. Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it. 'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.  Wow, that sucks, dude. Yeah. Kind of bitter. Aooooo! Yeess, this stuff rocks!  Whoopee! Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.  Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed! Bad! ''[goes with Kyle to get it] No'', we'll use it. Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks! Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine. Huh?? Our case? Uh... Hooray. Uh... ''[rising from the bottom] I like small businesses.'' Your dad really screwed us, Tweek! 'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!  Yeah, that makes sense. How do we stretch that into five minutes? What the hell?  Hey there, little guy. Hey, he talks! Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants? Business? Wait, do you know anything about business? Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us? Damn, dude, this place is huge! I don't get it. No you don't, fatass! Oh my God, they killed Kenny. Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed. Do you know anything about corporate ''take''overs? Underpants? Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations. Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!
