My God, what's going on out there? DA43 to tower, please advise!  Damnit! They aren't telling me anything! Virus, bacteria, either way we're all dead! Find out if he thinks it's safe to land in Los Angeles.  Please, I have two little girls in Chicago. Please find them! Then you have to stop it. And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from. You have to! You have to be strong. If you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it.  Promise me! Promise... me! Thank you-wait, what?
