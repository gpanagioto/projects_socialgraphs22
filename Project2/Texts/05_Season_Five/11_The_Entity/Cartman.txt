What's that thing? What? Forty bucks? Alright, alright. Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?  Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.  ...Oh, man.   Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.  I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars! Ugh, ugh! Oh! Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration ''camp''. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people ''were sent'' to concentration camps. Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea. No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  Goddamnit, give me another chance! Haha,   He's faaahn.  1, 2, 3, 4...  He's faaahn. Heheheheheh.   I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.  ...Good job, Jew!
