After the death of Wingfoot's grandfather, the Keewazi chief, the Council of Elders called on Wyatt to accept the position as tribal chieftain.  At the same time, the alien known as [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]] came to Oklahoma to devour Earth's resources, and the Fantastic Four arrived for battle.  Wyatt met the foursome's new member [[She-Hulk]], and he helped the team battle Terminus.

He was part of a group of innocent citizens kidnapped by a teleportation beam when [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] went after She-Hulk. He helped her to escape confinement by pressing the appropriate amount of weight onto the pressure-sensitive floor of the cell they were confined in. This was a difficult task as She-Hulk is much larger than his already tall form. This incident was part of an internal power struggle within S.H.I.E.L.D. and to further complicate things, one of the citizens was actually a sentient colony of cockroaches. They went after the corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in charge, endangering everyone on board and anyone the [[helicarrier]] might crash in to. She-Hulk soon neutralized the threat, and Wyatt survived the crash of the helicarrier.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18: ''She-Hulk''</ref> Alongside the Fantastic Four, Wyatt then battled [[Kristoff Vernard|Doctor Doom]] (actually Kristoff).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #278-279</ref> Alongside the Fantastic Four, Wyatt later investigated a temporal zone surrounding Central City, California.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #293-295</ref> Wyatt then attended the wedding of Johnny Storm and Alicia Masters (actually [[Lyja]] in disguise).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #300</ref> Wyatt later became engaged to She-Hulk; alongside her, he battled Carlton Beatrice, and then broke off the engagement.<ref>''She-Hulk: Ceremony'' #1-2</ref> Wyatt later accompanied Ka-Zar and [[Shanna the She-Devil]] back to the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Guns of the Savage Land'' Graphic Novel</ref>

Wyatt joined She-Hulk for some adventures in her own series. There, like many of the cast members, he became aware of his own reality as a fictional being. {{Issue|date=July 2009}}
