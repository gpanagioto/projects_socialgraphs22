'''Yondu Udonta''', or simply '''Yondu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɒ|n|d|uː}}), is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original version of the character is depicted as the last survivor of his species in the 31st century, and is a founding member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|original Guardians of the Galaxy]] team from the Marvel [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] alternate reality known as [[Earth-691]].

Yondu in Earth-691 is depicted as a blue-skinned male with a large red fin protruding from the back of his head and his back; he is a spiritual warrior who can control his killing arrows via sound waves, most commonly by whistling. Yondu joined [[Vance Astro]] and other survivors of the [[Badoon]] attack on the solar system in the 31st Century, who became known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. As part of the Guardians, Yondu traveled to present-day Earth and became an honorary member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The original Yondu never starred as a solo character in any Marvel Comic books, but was a core member of the team in the Guardians of the Galaxy comic that ran from 1990 to 1995.

[[Michael Rooker]] portrayed Yondu as a space pirate leading one of the factions of "The Ravagers" in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017).  After the release of the first film, Marvel Comics introduced this version of the character to the [[Earth-616]] comic book continuity. Additionally, Rooker voiced alternate versions of Yondu in the [[Disney+]] animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021).

Since his introduction, the present-day Yondu character has appeared in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' animated TV series and in several video games.

==Fictional character biography==
===Earth-691===
Yondu Udonta is a member of the Zatoan tribe, primitive beings native to [[Centauri IV]]. He functions as a hunter. His homeworld was the first planet to be colonized by humans that was outside the solar system. Yondu is born in the late 30th century. Yondu's people had fled from contact with overwhelming Earth colonizers who had begun arriving in 2940 A.D.

In 3006 A.D., [[Vance Astro]], an astronaut from Earth, lands on Yondu's planet with an antiquated propulsion ship. Vance encounters Yondu during the latter's trial of manhood. Yondu attacks him, but is repelled by Vance's powers. Vance keeps this secret as Yondu's action was illegal. Yondu works with Vance when the [[Badoon]], an alien race, overtakes the planet later that year. All the other Centaurians are believed to have been slaughtered. Vance and Yondu escape in his ship to fetch help but the Badoon capture them easily. The duo are taken to Earth which, by 3007 A.D., has also been conquered. When questioned, Vance pretends to be unfriendly with Yondu. They later escape and team up with [[Charlie-27]] of the [[Jupiter]] colony and [[Martinex]] of the [[Pluto]] colony, forming the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] to fight the Badoon.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #18.

For the next seven years, the four survivors attack the Badoon's outposts in the solar system. In 3014 A.D., the Guardians team with the time-traveling [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Captain America]], and [[Sharon Carter]] to retake New York City from the Badoon forces.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #5.

Since his newfound people will not accept his bionic weapon-hand, Yondu allows the Guardians to use their advanced medical technology to restore his flesh-and-blood hand. During their farewells, Vance apologizes for what he had thought was unacceptable treatment of Yondu during their earlier adventurers.<ref name="GotGA2">''Guardians of the Galaxy Annual'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Earth-616===
The Earth-616 version of Yondu has been identified by writer [[Sam Humphries]] as "the great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather of the Yondu in the original Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians 3000."<ref>Richards, Dave (October 22, 2015). [http://www.cbr.com/humphries-garron-chronicle-the-legendary-rise-of-star-lord/ "Humphries & Garron Chronicle the Legendary Rise of 'Star-Lord'"]. CBR.com</ref> In this reality, Yondu is the leader of the [[Ravagers (Marvel Comics)|Ravagers]], a group of [[space pirate]]s. Yondu finds [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] when his ship malfunctions and strands him in space.<ref>[[Humphries, Sam]] (w), Garron, Javier (a). ''Star-Lord'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Ravagers save Peter, he tries to steal their ship, managing to outsmart every member of the crew and capturing Yondu. After Yondu frees himself from his restraints and attacks Peter, he gives him a choice between letting himself be released into space without more trouble or execution. Peter instead asks to join his crew. Yondu is initially skeptical of this idea, but after he learns Peter, like him, is a homeless orphan, Yondu allows him to stay on the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy. Peter uses the opportunity to learn everything he can from space.<ref>Humphries, Sam (w), Garron, Javier (a). ''Star-Lord'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Yondu makes him an official Ravager.<ref>''Star-Lord'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a member of the [[marsupial]] alien race of the planet Centauri IV, Yondu possesses an intuitive mystical "sixth sense" perception that permits him limited empathic relationships with other lifeforms. The higher the lifeform, the more limited is his empathic potential. Additionally, Yondu possesses an intuitive rapport with nature, particularly with his own world, but also with any world that still possesses natural wildlife. With this rapport, he can sense incongruous elements (foreign bodies or substances) or focus on specific elements within the whole (such as the location of a given plant). He is also sensitive to mystical beings and forces and is able to detect their presence and activities without effort. Yondu is able to replenish his own inner strength by going into a trance and communing with natural forces.

Yondu is an above average physical specimen of his race. He has slightly more strength and endurance than the average human male. As a hunter, Yondu is an expert in the use of bow and arrow. His ability to whistle with a range of four octaves aids his archery (see Weapons, below). The native Centaurian language is a system of grunts, clicks, and whistles, but Yondu has managed to master the English language, although it is painful for him to speak for too long without resting his throat. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled hunter and tracker. He has extensive knowledge of the social and religious customs of the natives of Centauri IV.

===Weapons===
Yondu uses a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} single curve bow and a quiver of arrows composed of ''yaka'', a special sound-sensitive metal found only on Centauri IV. A yaka arrow can actually change its trajectory in response to certain high-octave whistle-sounds some Centaurians can produce. Yondu is so skillful at controlling his arrows, he can cause an arrow to return to his hand or weave its way through a crowd of people without touching them. Yondu's arrows are {{convert|15|in|cm}} in length and are very flexible. He carries about 20 of them at one time. In ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'', Yondu utilizes his expertise in archery by shooting "drone-arrows" to give the Guardians an eye in the sky.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

Yondu's right hand is replaced for a time by a bionic device called a weapons concealment appendage, a metal cup replacing his right hand.<ref name="GotG16"/> Thus, he could no longer practice archery nor perform functions requiring him to grasp with his right hand. The device can release from within itself a number of weapons, including a mace, a hatchet, a scythe, a barbed spear, and others; when not in use the weapons are concealed within the appendage at a reduced size, until enlarged by Pym particles. Yondu's bionic weapon-hand is later replaced with a duplicate of his original hand.<ref name="GotGA2"/>

In the present however, Quill steals an orb instead of turning it over to the Ravagers, leading to Udonta pursuing him. Udonta later captures Quill and [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], who discovered the orb contains the [[Infinity Stones|Power Stone]] and persuade him to help them save [[Xandar]] from [[Ronan the Accuser (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ronan the Accuser]]. Once Ronan is defeated, Udonta claims the orb from Quill and departs. While he learns it was a fake containing a [[Troll doll]], an amused Udonta adds it to his collection of small figurines.

Udonta and his Ravagers capture Rocket and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. However, when he announces his intent to renege on the deal, [[Taserface (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Taserface]] launches a mutiny and executes all of Udonta's loyalists while [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]] destroys his control fin. After being imprisoned, Rocket, Groot, and [[Kraglin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kraglin Obfonteri]] help Udonta secure a prototype fin so he can kill Taserface and the mutineers before escaping to help Quill and the other Guardians defeat Ego. As Ego's planet is destroyed, Udonta sacrifices himself to save Quill, having grown to see him as a son. At Udonta's funeral, Quill declares him his real father while Rocket informs the other Ravagers of Udonta's redemption.
