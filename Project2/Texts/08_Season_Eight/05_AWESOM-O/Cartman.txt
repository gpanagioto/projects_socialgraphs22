 Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000. I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot. Yes. I will be your new best friend. Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.  Really? Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.  That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets. Oh, really? Heh. Wow, that sucks. Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart. Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you. What? You saw that? Nuh uh. No way.  ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters? Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape? Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.  Oh, son of a bitch! AWESOM-O does not have a mom.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears? I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video? What? Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function. ...No way. Weak!  Lame! AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading. Where is it? Where is it?! Wah! Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you. AWESOM-O understands. Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape! I would like some Sunny Delight too.   I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer. Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay? Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?  Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Weak. Yes, of course.  Suck my balls, Kyle.  Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere. What? Lame. AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please? Thank you.  Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming.  Argh!  Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps? The New Orleans Saints.  Seventeen.  Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something. Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something. You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.  Haaaa! Haaaa! AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint. Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut. ...What? AWESOM-O does not understand.  Lame! Not cool! Totally lame!  Waaaaa! Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa! Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?! The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?! I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive! I said I'm a real person, asswipe! Goddamnit, get me down from here!   I'm not a robot, I'm a human! Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!  Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real! Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am!  I am the AWESOM-O 4000. Uh... now ending fart sequence. Smell sequence initiated. Lame...
