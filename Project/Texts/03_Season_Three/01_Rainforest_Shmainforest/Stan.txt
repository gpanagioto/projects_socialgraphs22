Choirs suck. It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing. What?! But we don't even ''care'' about the rainforest. <i>[As Sharon drags him to the bus]</i> Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please! Nooo-ho! <i>[The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]</i> No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right. Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. <i>[Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle]</i> <i>[sees a branch]</i> Aaah! Snake! Oh. <i>[sees it again]</i> Aaah! Snake! Oh. AAAAAAA! <i>[hides behind a girl]</i> SNAAAKE! <i>[all see and gasp]</i> AAAAAAA! <i>[runs farther back]</i> <i>[lifts some away]</i> I'm just a-scared of snakes. Dude! Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!! I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme. This doesn't look very safe. Hey. Maybe Cartman was right. Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke?  Holy crap!  Jesus Christ! We're sinking. All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"! Oh, ''now'' she figures it out. Wow! Oh my God! They killed Kenny! ''They'' did.  You know, "they." Help ...him?
