 Who?  Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle? You guys, this is ''our'' party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! ''Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!''''' Dude, what are you doing? THAT's gay, heh. Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?  Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football! You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew. No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole! Who?  The smug?  I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits. You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength. I'm not doin' it for Kyle.   Butters, are you there?! I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL? Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store. Turning right at O two four niner.  Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?! Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go! Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!   Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle? We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat! Ah, that's better.
