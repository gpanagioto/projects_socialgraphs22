==Fictional character biography==

===Hellfire Club===
Little is known of Leland's past before encountering the X-Men, although he did encounter former teammate, [[Emma Frost]], before she was inducted into the Hellfire Club. At the time, Emma was homeless and using her powers during a Hellfire Club meeting to gain information about stocks. Leland takes an interest in her but comes on too strongly, and Emma runs away.  Shortly after, he accompanies [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]] and his NYPD partner to an incident behind the club which involves Emma. Emma, having met and repaired the fractured mind of the [[Dark Beast]] with her powers, mind-wipes all three men into forgetting the incident and that they had ever met.<ref>''Generation X'' #-1</ref>

Leland encounters the X-Men when they invade the New York headquarters of the Hellfire Club. Leland causes [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to become increasingly heavy until he falls through the floor into a sub-basement. In the rematch, Wolverine attacks Leland from above. Leland panics and uses his mass-increasing powers, resulting in Wolverine crashing through the floor again, this time with Leland beneath him. Leland is hospitalized as a result.<ref>''The [[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #132-135 (April–July 1980).</ref> When the Hellfire Club again captures the X-Men weeks later, Leland takes revenge by using his power on Wolverine until his heart gives out, though his rival's death proves to be a temporary state induced by [[Amanda Sefton]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #152 (Dec. 1981)</ref>

Alongside the Hellfire Club, Leland battles the X-Men in New York's [[Central Park]]. When [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] attacks the assembled mutants, the X-Men and the Club join forces to battle Nimrod. Leland increases Nimrod's mass to make it more vulnerable to attack. Overweight and in poor health, the effort triggers a heart attack. At [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s urging, Leland increases the mass of Sebastian Shaw (who had been sent hurtling towards outer space), causing Shaw to crash into Nimrod. Leland succumbs to his heart condition and dies.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #208–209 (August–September 1986).</ref>

===X-Humed===
The supervillain [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] revives Leland's body as a zombie,<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #34</ref> and sets him and other undead mutants ([[Kevin Sydney|Changeling]], [[Living Diamond]], and [[Scaleface]]) against [[She-Hulk]]. She defeats them, and Leland is reburied, with precautions are taken to ensure that he never will come back, among them filling his mouth with salt and sewing his lips together.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #35</ref>

===Necrosha===
Despite the precautions made to prevent Leland's body from coming back as a zombie, the psychic vampire [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] revives Leland with the use of a modified version of the Transmode virus during the [[Necrosha]] storyline.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Leland is sent to Utopia with [[Shinobi Shaw]], who was revived by the same means, to kill Sebastian Shaw, [[Donald Pierce]], Emma Frost, [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and the X-Men.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Reign of X===
Under the X-Men 2019 reboot of ''[[Dawn of X]]'' and ''[[Reign of X]]'', Leland is resurrected to provide the new mutant island nation of Krakoa with an ambassador in the United Nations. It is also revealed that he is in fact Shinobi Shaw's biological father.<ref>''Marauders'' #26 (2021).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Leland possesses the ability to increase the mass of an object or person within {{convert|350|ft|m}} of him, without affecting its size at all, making it increasingly heavy. Though he can only increase mass up to roughly 20 [[kilogram]]s per second, there is seemingly no limit to the total mass he can add to a person or object. Leland's power can affect both people and inanimate objects, but active resistance by the subject makes it more difficult to assert Leland's power. Leland is overweight and in poor health, and thus he is a poor hand-to-hand combatant.

==Other versions==

===House of M===
Harry Leland appears as the Commissioner of the NYPD, in which he was in discussion with [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|John Proudstar]] about the assaults on Sapien Town and the Brotherhood's attempts of capturing Luke Cage's gang.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #5</ref>
