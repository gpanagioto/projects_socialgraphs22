Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together! Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we ''can'' do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know. What? How do you know? Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low! Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft.  Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here! You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn! Corey Lanskin? We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults. Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house. So you know it. We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft. Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please. Can we talk to your supervisor please?! You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel? Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
