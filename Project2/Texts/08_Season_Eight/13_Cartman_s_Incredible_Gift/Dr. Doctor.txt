I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma. There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see.  You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time. It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now. Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days.   I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do. Yes, it was pretty severe. This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours.  Of course. Nurse?
