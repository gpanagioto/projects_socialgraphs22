That's nice, Cartman. Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours? Please stop.  Please stop! What's all ''that'' stuff? Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We ''have'' to ''go'', dude!  I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous. It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet ''me''! Cool! Oh, God!  Jesus Christ, finally! Agghh!  That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee. Dude, your family died? What?! What is this??  Sick, dude! Whoa, dude!   Aaww!  I know what you mean.   Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans! Oh. Arrggh!  I heard it, too.  I wanted to make sure, too. Dude, it's coming through the window!  We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman. Yeah, they do! Dude, we ''have'' to get to the mall!! Good for you, Charlie!  Do you see him? I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came! That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous. So?! Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants.   Hoh, boy. Here we go! You're not the real Mr. Hankey. This is ''not'' Mr. Hankey!  Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To ''children''?  What?! What did you say?!  Behold! Here's your false prophet! It was a fake! Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots! I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed! God, I ''hate'' the holiday season!  What's your mom doing here, dude?  Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some ''fake'' Mr. Hankey spoil ''my'' holidays.
