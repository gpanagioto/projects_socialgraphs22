Yes my son. Of course Robert. How are things now? Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air.  My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see- Leave me alone. 
Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Yes, my son.  -- Yea, the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and- Jesus! 
Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace. First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'. Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback. Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know. Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question? Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance. Next caller, you're on the air. Yes my son? My son... I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole. Next caller. I heard that. 
<poem><i>Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...</i></poem> 
Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou.  Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show. Wow. That's pretty heavy. The ''Dark Prince?'' So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One. Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth. Damien! So it is thou, Son of ''Lucifer''! Let him come then. I shall stop him! Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - ''right here in South Park!'' This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history. Not yet. ... What the hell do you mean ''if'' I win the fight? Oh. Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation. Behold. The Evil One approaches. Oh - oh yeah?? Oh yeah?? Aw, come on! I weigh more than that. Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar- I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning. In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me! Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too! I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win. ''You're all a bunch of Judases!'' What are you doing out so late, kids? Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right? No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little? No way, dude! Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train. Give it your best sho-  Anybody get the number of that truck?  Oh! Oow!  Ooooooh! Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on ''Satan''. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook. It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up. ... Who said that? You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys! Okay, pal. ''You asked'' for it! Aw heck.  Do I have a choice? 
Our Savior! 
But I don't really care about that.  Ohh, alright. Uhhh... Hi. Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction. We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver. Hi, Bob Denver. So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?  So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?  Oh boy. Yeah? Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do? If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle. And yet, somehow, he managed to survive. W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions. Yes, uhh, you over there. Kick ''who'' to the curb? But-- Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else. Yes, your comments. Wha-what are you talking about? Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages. Uhhh, clever? Unless what? Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again. What video tapes? Yea, children. I am the way and the light... We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they? Is that true, Stan? Uhh, we'll find out more about this ''debauchery'' when we return. Welcome back to ''Jesus and Pals''. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies? Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you. O-okay, okay, that's enough. Uh, let's watch the language, people. Let's all just..make our way back to our seats. Let's all just..make our way back to our seats. Shut the fuck up! Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused. The ''entire'' Vietcong Army? Is it? And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and-- Wait. Jimbo made that up? What? Oh, really? W-wait, everybody. Come back. I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place. Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, butâ€”Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--  I sent her away. 
Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones.  Caller, you're on the air. That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming. Do you have an opinion on global warming? Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park. 
 How are y'all doing tonight? <poem><i>And heaven and nature sing...</i></poem> <poem><i>And heaven and na-</i></poem> He he hoo, get away!  ''Get'' away. <poem><i>Cute little eight-pound me (Santa: Oo-oo)</i></poem> <poem><i>Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory-</i></poem> <poem><i>-to Me!<br />Silent Night,</i></poem> <poem><i>Holy Night</i></poem> <poem><i>All is calm, all is bright<br />Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me.</i></poem> Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's- Aw, come on, Santa. You can't leave. But Santa... ''The weather outside is frightful'' <poem><i>But the fire so delightful</i></poem> <poem><i>It doesn't show signs of stoppin'.</i></poem> <poem><i>But as long as you love me so,</i></poem> <poem><i>let it snow!</i></poem> 
Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing?  Uuh-huh? So, what happens at the millennium? Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace. Well, what do ya want? Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute.   Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback! It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you. But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback. Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30. Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!  Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.  Hey, Rod, great to see you. Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever! What? Poo pants? Uh, you pooped your pants? Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?  What??  ...Hello? Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. ''Please'' make them like it. Well, I tell you one thing. ''I'' sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod "Do You Think I'm Sexy?" Stewart!  Oh no.  Please, Father. Do something.  Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight. Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again. Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you. Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life. If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party. I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.   It's Dad. Father. You came. Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End. 
Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school. God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him. But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins! No. Worse! 
 Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength. A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!   Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny. So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent? I can't say I approve of this, my children. Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute. 
You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle! Christmas is for celebrating my birth! 
Of course. I know you, my child. Come in. You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing. The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine. Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.  It is now wine! Wuh well, yeah. Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago. Then let's go. Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.  Hold! My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now ''that'' is a miracle!  Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?  Jesus Christ! His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it. I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends.  Buddha. Buddha, come in! Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before. Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long. Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes. Are you still keeping your eyes closed? Good. Want some peanuts? Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right. Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish. Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night. Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status. Not so fast, David Blaine! Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends!  The mass suicide is ''over'', Blaine! And so are you! That takes care of them. We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad!  Great Scott! There has to be a way to destroy it.  Jesus to Moses! Come in, Moses! We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.  You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth! That should do the trick. Now for some concrete. Lao Tse, bring it to life.  It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves!  Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine! Goddamnit!  Oh, shut up, Buddha! Well, it looks like everything worked out.  
  Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children? Santa? Is he alright? We have to get him out of there. Yes. Yes, I think I do.  Lock and load! We're goin' in! He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.  Wait here, I can handle this. Yay, look upon me, and know me. My children, you should know something.  Here.  Can you walk? They are healed.  Santa... Let's move. Move!  You're a... bad liar.  Hey. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh? Uh Santa? Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit.  
Wa!  Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!!  
Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush?  
 I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things. Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan. This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter ''was'' a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope. What are you doing?!  What is your problem, guy?! We'll never get out in time to stop him!  Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me. Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars. Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle! Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately. My son, there is no time! Do it! I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter. Awgh!  Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent! One man cannot be the voice of the Church! Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position.  
 No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be. That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice!  
 Aslan, the evil characters are almost here! There are so many of them. HAAAAA!  Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus. What seems to be the problem, my child? Popeye, I need some help here!   All right! He did it! 
My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances. But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form. Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids!  Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses?  
Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem. Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag! What? On the Super Best Screen! Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand!  I don't know, Seaman.  Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  We have to find another weak spot!  Moses! We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have! All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!  Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you. Let's hope to Christ this works.  Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise! ''Nobody'' is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!  Kyaaaaa! I guess maybe Tom Cruise ''likes'' Seaman.  Who's the creepy ginger kid? That's right. Don't you see, gingers? If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop. 
My child,  have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad. Oh, what are you gonna do? cwy now? 
Shhhh. My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use... That's what I'm doing.  Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son. Yeah, I know how it goes. I ''know''. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud. NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son? Pff, I know, right? Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here.  P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos? Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again! We need to get some bracelets. I'm confused. These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can. You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out.  You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarus need my help. Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now.  I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarus busting my ass! What are you on?! What?  Aw, shit! Yeah... Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us. What can we possibly do? Vengeance is mine!  Get out!  Thank you my children.  
I can't believe what I'm hearing!  I have heard your prayers, Marsh! And I've been watching. You want people to think that home-grown cocaine is the same as legalizing marijuana? No!  Okay, I get it. It's really clean. It's... yeah. It's a good high. Well, maybe we all do need a little Tegridy at Christmas time.  I think it's time for a little Christmas miracle.  I'll bet when coke becomes legal soon, everyone will want Tegridy Cocaine!
