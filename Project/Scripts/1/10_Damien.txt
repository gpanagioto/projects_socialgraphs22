Classroom: Cartman enters humming with a stack of envelopes. He starts handing them out.

Cartman

Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...

Kyle

What is this, Cartman?

Cartman

They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.

Stan

Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?

Cartman

Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...

Kyle

Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.

Cartman

That's right.

Stan

Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too.

Cartman

That's ri-aayy.

Pip

Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation.

Cartman

[darting over] Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!

-----


Pip smiles hopefully.

Cartman

I shoved it up my ass!

-----


Pip's hopes are dashed.

Cartman

Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!

-----


moves on

Cartman

Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...

Mr. Garrison

[excitedly] Children, children! Today is a very special day.

Cartman

No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.

Mr. Garrison

I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.

Cartman

Eeeeeeh!

Mr. Garrison

Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... [leans down to the new kid, Damien] uh-uh, what's your name again?

Damien Thorn

Damien!

Ominous voice


Rectus...dominus...



-----


Dark music and changing plays as Damien's eyes show flaming, crackling pupils.

Mr. Garrison

Say 'hi' to Damien! [Silence.] And where are you from, Damien?

Damien

The seventh layer of hell!

Mr. Garrison

Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama.

-----


Damien goes around the teacher's desk and hops up on it, kicking away the apple. Garrison steps aside.

Damien

My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father!

Ominous voice


... rectus... cheesy poofs...



Mr. Garrison

Your father?

Damien

The Prince of Darkness!

Mr. Garrison

Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.

-----


Damien hops down and goes to sit next to Cartman.

Mr. Garrison

Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...

Cartman

Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?

Damien

Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...

Cartman

Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?

Ominous voice


Rectus... dominus...



-----


Damien turns to Cartman and concentrates. Cartman's desk suddenly turns over and dumps him onto the floor.

Cartman

Byah. Oof!

-----


The desk goes out the window. The class sits up.

Stan

Whoa, dude!

Ominous voice


Sancti...



Kyle

Damn, what a freak!

Cartman

[Getting up off the floor.] Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!

Ominous voice


Cheesy poofs...



Damien

Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.

Mr. Garrison

Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?

-----


Damien blinks.

Cartman

Eheh. [Taunting.] You got in trouble, you got in trouble.

-----


The cafeteria: The boys already have their lunches.

Stan

Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?

Kyle

Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.

Cartman

Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.

Stan

Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.

Kyle

Yeah, that's weak!

Cartman

Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?

Stan

Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.

-----


Kyle crumples up the invitation and throws it away.

Cartman

Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.

Stan

Oh great, Green Mega Man it is.

Cartman

Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is.

-----


Damien arrives.

Stan

Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?

Cartman

Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!

Damien

Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!

Kyle

You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!

-----


Damien walks off.

Cartman

Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.

-----


Stan and Kyle laugh, then Cartman laughs. Kenny punches him.

Cartman

Eeyy!

-----


Damian walks over to where Pip is.

Pip

Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.

Damien

Then I will call you Pip.

Pip

Right-o.

Stan

Hey new kid!

-----


Cartman turns around. Kenny is already facing him.

Stan

Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.

Kenny

(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)

Damien

That does it! Woo-paah.

-----


Points his index fingers at Kenny.

Ominous voice


... rectus... dominus...



-----


Kenny trembles for a moment, and then a moment of silence.

Stan

What the...Â ?

Kyle

Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.

Stan

A what?

Kenny

Quack-quack.

Cartman

Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!

-----


Chef comes up behind them.

Chef

Hello there, children.

Stan

Hey, Chef.

Chef

How's it going?

Kyle

Bad.

Chef

Why bad?

Kyle

Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.

Chef

Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song, 
We're all special in our own way
everybody's different, but that's okay,
'cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin,
different points of view, be tall or thin,
it doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin,



-----


A psychedelic scene appears behind him.

Chef


With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,



-----


He stands behind a lovely black woman wearing trunks and a big smile.

Chef


Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...



-----


He floats on a cloud with a lovely white woman, then he's back in the cafeteria

Chef

What were we talking about again?

Kyle

The new kid.

-----


Damian is standing on a table.

Damien

Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all!

Ominous voice


Rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs...



-----


Pip's cap flies off, followed by milk and lunch trays, large tote bags, wall poster, clocks...

Stan

Whoa!

Chef

Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!

-----


...Footballs, bunnyfish, desks, telephones, fire alarms, rifles...

Kyle

We told you, dude.

-----


Kids scream. Pip is awestruck. Kids and lunch tables begin to rise and fly around.

Chef

We've got to do something, children!

-----


Mr. Hankey flies by, then Kevin Stoley, then a cow. (think Twister)

Damien

Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus!

Ominous voice


... rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... rectus... dominus...



Stan, Kyle

Jesus?

-----


The set of Jesus and Pals. Jesus freshens up, and Roland the cameraman comes in

Roland

Two minutes to air, Jesus.

Jesus

Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. [Stan and Kyle dash in.]

Stan

Jesus, Jesus!

Jesus

Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.

Stan

No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.

Kyle

Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.

Kenny

Quack-quack.

Jesus

Wow. That's pretty heavy.

Stan

This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.

Jesus

The Dark Prince?

Stan

Yeah.

Kyle

Yeah.

Jesus

So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.

Stan

[To Kyle.] Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.

Jesus

Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.

Kyle

... K.

-----


School playground

Groundskeeper

Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!

-----


Cartman is heard speaking. Three kids look at him: Wendy, Clyde, and Brimmy, who is taking notes. Cartman stands next to an easel, pointing at drawings he made earlier. A boy with a blue hat joins them later

Cartman

Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money...

-----


A football lands in front of Damien, who sets fire to it. He then points to the slide, which catches fire and sends Red into another student as Bebe looks on.

Ominous voice


Rectus... dominus... sancti...



Red

Aaaaa Bebe!

Bebe

Our slide!

Damien

Feel my wrath!

-----


Damien sends a small fireball from his fingertip to the see-saw, setting it aflame and knocking off Kevin Stoley and Tolkien.

-----


Damien torches the hobby elephants. A boy with a brown hat screams as fire is set to the hobby elephant he's playing on.

Pip

[As Damien torches the hobby elephants.] Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.

Damien

I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan!

-----


He torches the jungle gym. Butters screams as he falls off.

Pip

Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.

Ominous voice


... Rectus... cheesy poofs...



Jesus

Damien!

Damien

Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!

Jesus

So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!

Damien

Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes.

Jesus

Let him come then. I shall stop him!

Damien

Behold! He is already upon us! [Clouds begin to conceal the sun.

Kyle

Ohh, dude!

Satan

Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.

-----


Another whirlwind comes up.

Jimbo

What the hell's going on here?

-----


A crowd begins to gather.

Father Maxi

Look! It's that guy from the public access show!

Blonde

What's happening?

Chef

Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!

-----


Garrison leans onto him.

Chef

Not you, dammit!

Satan

Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.

Damien

Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!

Jesus

Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!

Jimbo

Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!

-----


The Crowd disperses.

Stan

You're gonna fight Satan?

Jesus

This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.

Commercial

Who will win our souls?

-----


An hourglass spins on a horizontal axis.

Commercial

Our Savior and Lord?

-----


Jesus launches a fireball into the darkness.

Commercial

Or the Prince of Darkness?

-----


A red demon looms over several fleeing people.

Commercial

It's the final battle between Good and Evil.

-----


A black figure and a white one bump heads.

Commercial

And it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95.

-----


Cartman's house. The boys have just seen the commercial

Cartman

Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!

Kenny

Quack-quack.

Stan

[To Kyle.] I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?

Cartman

Cartman's birthday!

Kyle

We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!

Cartman

You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.

Stan

Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in.

Cartman

Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!

-----


Main St. A crowd is gathered for the weigh-in. Jesus waits for him, too

Father Maxi

When is Satan gonna show up?

-----


The boys rush up.

Stan

Did the Devil show up yet?

Jesus

Not yet.

Kyle

Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?

Jesus

... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?

Cartman

Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.

Jesus

Oh.

Jimbo

We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince.

-----


The crowd cheers.

Jesus

Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation.

Father Maxi

You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus.

-----


More cheering. A pillar of fire appears.

Ominous Vocie


Rectus... dominus...



Jesus

Behold. The Evil One approaches.

Satan

Yeah.

-----


He appears, and the crowd gasps at his size.

Mr. Garrison

Holy poop on a stick!

Satan

Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!

Stan

Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.

Jimbo

Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!

Satan

Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!

Jesus

Oh - oh yeah??

Man in crowd

Damn.

Satan

I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.

Jesus

Oh yeah??

-----


A scale is brought in, and Satan is directed to stand on it.

Announcer

Satan weighs in at - 320 lbs, 4 oz.

-----


The crowd gasps. Satan steps off, and Jesus steps on.

Announcer

Jesus Christ weighs in at - 135 lbs., 1 oz.

-----


The crowd lets out a long sigh of disappointment.

Chef

Ooh crap.

Jesus

Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.

Satan

Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world.

-----


The clouds gather behind him. He then turns and walks away.

Jimbo

[Holding his ticket up.] Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.

Mr. Garrison

Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too.

Father Maxi

Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck.

-----


The crowd breaks up.

-----


The Sports Book $. Two screens are showing horse races

Man 1

Change my bet!

Man 2

I'm betting on the Devil!

Jimbo

I wanna change my bet to Satan.

Ned

Me, too.

Mr. Garrison

Wai-wa I was here first.

-----


South Park Elementary, Mr. Mackey's office. Damien is in

Mr. Mackey

Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay?

Damien

Everybody hates me!

Mr. Mackey

Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?

Damien

Because I'm the son of the Devil?

Mr. Mackey

Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?

Damien

Because I... burn them and kill them?

Mr. Mackey

Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. And no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. You be passive, m'kay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now.

-----


The playground. Bebe, Kevin Stoley, Butters, and Clyde surround Pip.

Clyde

I bet I can spit the most on him.

-----


Spits, and it lands on Pip's left shoulder.

Bebe

Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.

-----


Spits, and it lands on his right eye.

Pip

Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.

Stan

Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'.

Cartman

[Sees Damien coming.] Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!

Damien

I apologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice.

-----


A sequence of blinks hints as to the boys' response. Cartman moves closer to Damien.

Cartman

[Farts and moves away.] Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!

-----


Damien is angry, but restrains himself.

Stan

Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.

Kyle

Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on.

Stan

Bubye, Fart-boy.

Kyle

See ya.

Pip

Good day, Damien. How are you?

Damien

Those guys farted on me, and then called me-

Pip

Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.

-----


Skeeter's bar; people are having drinks. Chef is at the bar talking to someone. Jesus throws open the doors and enters

Jesus

Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-

Chef

Oh ooh.

-----


A woman at a nearby table whistles the same thing.

Jesus

I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.

-----


Two men at the bar look at each other.

Jesus

In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!

Father Maxi

You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!

Jesus

Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!

Father Maxi

Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus.

Jesus

I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.

Father Maxi

Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!

Mr. Garrison

Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.

Jimbo

Yeah.

Father Maxi

Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.

-----


Jesus turns and walks out.

Father Maxi

What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?

Mr. Garrison

Yeah, crazy.

-----


Bill Allen and Fosse McDonald's fathers chortle behind him.

Mr. Allen

He's so gay.

Mr. McDonald

Yeah.

-----


The two men seen earlier toast the comments, and Jesus looks in once more.

Jesus

You're all a bunch of Judases!

-----


Outside the bar. Jesus runs into Stan, Kyle, and Kenny

Stan

Hey, Jesus.

Jesus

What are you doing out so late, kids?

Kyle

We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.

Jesus

Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right?

Stan

Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.

Kyle

Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?

Jesus

No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?

-----


Satan's press conference. At least three television stations (4, 11, and 38) have crews present.

Reporter 1

Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?

Satan

I will crush him like a little bug!

Reporter 2

Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War?

-----


Satan thinks a moment, then begins to answer, but a hand covers his mouth.

Don King

Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.

-----


A training room. Jesus is working on a punching bag while Stan and Kyle look on. Cartman enters.

Cartman

You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?

Stan

Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.

Jesus

No way, dude!

Chef

[In the ring.] Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.

Stan

But you're his sparring partner, Chef.

Kyle

Yeah, you have to hit him.

Jesus

Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.

Chef

Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?

Jesus

Give it your best sho- [Poof.] Oh! [Falls back to the floor.]

Chef

Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!

Jesus

Anybody get the number of that truck? [Drops his head.]

-----


Cartman's birthday party; several balloons are tethered to the banner. Carnival music plays. Two elephants are present, as is the Ferris wheel, all in the backyard.

Liane

Come on, kiddies. Eat more.

-----


Cartman is greeting children as they come in with his presents.

Cartman

Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.

Chef

Yup! Here's your present, children.

-----


Hands Cartman his gift.

Chef

Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later.

Kyle

Hey, you just got here, Chef!

Chef

I know, but the fight is starting.

Stan

Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.

-----


Liane turns to see what Stan said, and sees Chef.

Liane

Mmmmm.

Chef

Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.

-----


On the sidewalk in front of Cartman's house, Damien and Pip sit.

Damien

I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.

Pip

Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.

Damien

The other kids have always hated you?

Pip

Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me.

-----


Damien gets an idea.

-----


South Park Forum.

Michael Buffer

In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!

-----


The crowd cheers.

Michael Buffer

And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!

-----


The crowd now cheers for Satan. Jesus turns and glowers at them, and they shrink away.

Michael Buffer

Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!

Referee

Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles.

-----


The bell rings.

-----


Cartman's birthday party. A carny does tricks. Damien enters with Pip in tow.

Cartman

Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?

Stan

Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.

Kyle

And neither were you, Pip!

Pip

Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-

Damien

Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.

-----


His eyes flare up again.

Ominous voice


Rectus... dominus...



-----


Damien taps Pip on the shoulder and the ground opens up.

-----


Small demons grab Pip.

Ominous voice


... Sancti... cheesy poofs...



Pip

Aaaa!

-----


He is launched like a rocket.

Pip

Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!

-----


He gives off fireworks.

Kyle

Wow!

Stan

Whoa, that was cool!

-----


The children, Bebe, Wendy, and Clyde among them, look up and are duly impressed. They applaud.

Kyle

Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.

Cartman

Yeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased]

-----


South Park Forum, round 2. Satan and Jesus meet up. Satan gives Jesus a hard left, throwing him against the ropes. The crowd cheers. Jesus looks back, and they are silent. Jesus turns to fight, but receives a blow in the abdomen, again stumbling to the ropes. Satan gives him a left cross. Satan stands back, and Jesus' halo now flutters all over the place.

Satan

Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!

-----


Cartman's birthday party. He is now opening his presents.

Cartman

Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves.] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[She leaves.] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?! [Thumps the table in anger.]

Kyle

It's a game, dude. It's really fun.

Cartman

You son of a bitch! [Lunges towards Kyle.]

Kyle

[As he is pinned by Cartman.] Aaaaa!

Cartman

You were supposed to get me the red Mega Man, eh! Now I can't make the Ultra Mega Mega Man, you dirty cheap-ass piece of crap! [Slapping him around by now.]

Kyle

They were all out of 'em dude!

Cartman

I hate you! I want you to die! Die!!

Cartman

Aah! Aaaaaggghhhhh!!

Kyle

[Sobbing.] Aaaaaaaa!

-----


Cartman gets up and moves toward the center of the yard.

Cartman

That's it! Party is over!

-----


The kids look glum.

Cartman

Everybody go home!

-----


He turns the party switch off. Music slows to a stop, everything goes dark, and the banner floats away.

Cartman

Get the hell out, I said! The party's over! Get out goddammt!!

-----


The kids exit the backyard as Cartman announces that the party is over.

-----


Stan and Kyle stop.

Stan

Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!

Cartman

Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!

-----


Throws it at Kyle, who is felled by it. The kids regroup in front of the house.

Damien

Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.

Stan

[swings his left arm] Aaanh, he does this all the time.

Chef

Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!

-----


Pip descends from above.

Pip

Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.

-----


South Park Forum, a later round. Satan gives Jesus a fierce left, launching him into the air and against the ropes again. Jesus comes forward, and Satan gives him a right to the face.

Jesus

Oh!

-----


Backs up helplessly.

Satan

Fight, dammit!

-----


Gives him another right to the face.

Jesus

Oow! [Satan pick him up] Ooooooh!

-----


Satan throws him against the rope, then gives him another right to the face. Jesus now has a swollen left eye.

-----


Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach Jesus' corner.

Stan

Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [The round ends.] You've got to fight, Jesus.

Jesus

Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.

Kyle

Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.

Jesus

It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.

Stan

Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him.] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!

Kyle

Uuuuh. Stan?

Stan

Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!

Kyle

Stan.

Stan

She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!

Kyle

Stan!

Stan

[Turning to Kyle.] What?

Kyle

Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.

Stan

[Thinks a moment.] ... Really?

Kyle

Yeah, dude!

Stan

Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.

Jesus takes a ladleful of water from a pail next to him.

Stan

You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'.

Jesus

... Who said that?

Stan

You did, Jesus.

-----


Jesus ponders these words as he looks at Satan.

Jesus

You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys!

-----


He gets up as the next round begins and fights without his halo.

Kyle

Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?

Stan

Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.

Kyle

Hmmm.

-----


Satan takes a couple of swings at Jesus, but Jesus ducks them.

Satan

Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!

Jesus

Okay, pal. You asked for it!

-----


The crowd looks on as Jesus prepares to punch Satan. Jesus delivers the blow, but nothing happens. The sound of escaping air is heard. Stan just buries his head in his hands in disbelief.

-----


Satan protecting his ribs.

Satan

Ooooooh, you got me.

-----


He drops flat on his back.

Referee

One... Two... Three...

Jimbo

No way! He barely touched him!

Referee

... Seven... Eight.

-----


Satan opens his left eye, then closes it again.

Referee

... Nine... Ten. You're out!

-----


The match ends, and Jesus jumps up in victory.

Stan, Kyle

Our Savior!

Michael Buffer

The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!

-----


Satan pops right back up.

Mr. Garrison

Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!

Jimbo

Yeah!

Satan

Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?

-----


The crowd wonders.

Satan

Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!

-----


Satan dances out of the ring.

Father Maxi

I don't believe this!

Mr. Garrison

Yeah, what a mean thing to do!

Satan

[Now on the Forum floor.] Farewell, fools!

Jimbo

Man, that guy is a jerk.

-----


Satan dances away and Stan enters the ring.

Stan

[Over the microphone.] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.

Mr. Garrison

Boy, did we get screwed.

Chef

Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?

Jesus

Aw heck. [Puts his halo back on.] Do I have a choice?

-----


The crowd cheers with relief.

Jimbo

Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!

-----


Kenny is highlighted.

Jimbo

Ih-it's comin' right for us!

-----


Jimbo pulls out a semi-automatic and fires away at Kenny. Kenny is soon on the floor with his head blown off.

Stan

Oh my God, they killed Kenny.

Kyle

You bastard!

Damien

Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you.

-----


Rats swarm all over Kenny's head.

Stan

You're leaving already?

Damien

I have to. My dad's always on the move.

-----


The rats leave also.

Stan

Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.

Kyle

Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.

Stan

Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?

-----


Cartman's backyard. He's the only one at the picnic table, and it's still full of food. Cartman looks full, though.

Liane

More pie, hon?

Cartman

Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
