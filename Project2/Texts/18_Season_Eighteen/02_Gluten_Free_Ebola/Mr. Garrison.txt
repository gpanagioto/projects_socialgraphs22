Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing. It's just the new diet fad!   Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please? I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore. Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go. Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face. Yes, thank you!  Get out of there! You gotta get out! Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard! There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce.  Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat. There's nothing left, I told you. A setup? But by who?
