(TV series)|What If…?]]'' (both 2021).

==Publication history==
Batroc, created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #75 in March 1966.

Sporting a muted, subtle redesign by [[Gurihiru]], Batroc served as the primary mentor of [[Gwenpool|Gwen Poole]] in [[Christopher Hastings]]' 2016–2018 series ''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'', with the relationship between Gwen and Batroc being described as "one of the warmest aspects" of the series.<ref name="AV" /><ref name="CB" />

==Fictional character biography==
Georges Batroc was born in [[Marseille]], [[France]], and served in the [[French Foreign Legion]]. He is a [[French people|French]] costumed mercenary who specializes in [[savate]] (also known as "La Boxe Française"), a form of [[kickboxing]], with acrobatic skills and unusual articulate flexibility. Although he has primarily appeared in the pages of ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'', he has also faced off against the [[Punisher]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]]. Batroc has occasionally led his own team, "Batroc's Brigade", although the membership has changed over time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=115}}</ref> The group has primarily fought Captain America.

In the character's first appearance, he was hired by [[THEM (Marvel universe)|Them]] to steal the Inferno-42 cylinder. He first battled [[Captain America]] during this mission. When Batroc introduced himself with typical bluster, Cap revealed, to Batroc's delight, that he had already heard of the mercenary: "Batroc the Leaper, eh? A master of la [[savate]], the French art of boxing with the feet!"<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #75–76. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he was again hired by [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and abducted [[Sharon Carter]] for them. He lured Captain America into a rematch, in which he insisted HYDRA not intervene, and again lost; however, when HYDRA agents prepared to kill both Cap and himself, Batroc, incensed at such "men wizout honair", switched sides to help Cap against HYDRA.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #85. Marvel Comics.</ref> In both of these stories, Batroc was regarded as a deadly combatant, his skill respected by enemies and employers alike.

===Batroc's Brigade===
Batroc was then hired by a foreign power to locate a "seismo-bomb" with the first known Batroc's Brigade (consisting of the original [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and the [[Living Laser]]). Batroc battled Captain America again.<ref>''Captain America'' #105. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Machinesmith]]'s [[Baron Strucker]] android known as "the Hood" then hired a new Batroc's Brigade (consisting of the [[Porcupine (Marvel Comics)|Porcupine]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]) to battle Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #130. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Batroc then formed a third Batroc's Brigade, which consisted of various unnamed henchmen, rather than known supervillains, since supervillains had failed Batroc in the past. The alien Jakar, concealing his true nature and intent, hired this group to abduct children from New York and to battle Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. Although Batroc felt no compunction about abducting children, upon learning Jakar's true nature and his intent to use the children's souls to revive his comatose race, he felt his "sense of honair" had been violated by the deception, and he again switched sides, aiding Captain America and the Falcon to rescue the children.<ref>''Captain America'' #149–150. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Ward Meachum]] then hired Batroc's Brigade, who battled [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and a ninja warrior, several Brigade members dying in the process.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

For a while after that, Batroc operated without a Brigade. Alongside an extra-dimensional demon ally, Batroc attempted a theft of [[transuranium]], but was stopped by Captain America and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #52. Marvel Comics.</ref> Batroc was also a member of the ersatz "Defenders", a group of villains who were impersonating the actual [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. They committed robberies while posing as members of the Defenders, until stopped by a Defenders contingent.<ref>''The Defenders'' #63–64. Marvel Comics.</ref> Alongside [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], Batroc attempted an extortion scheme against Manhattan. He battled Captain America, but when Mister Hyde decided to carry out the threat, which would kill thousands, Batroc, again showing that there were some lines he would not cross, aided Captain America against Hyde, saving the city.<ref>''Captain America'' #251–252. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Batroc then formed a new, longer-lasting lineup of Batroc's Brigade - this one consisting of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: Z#Maximillian Zaran|Zaran the Weapons Master]] and [[Machete (comics)|Machete]]. This team was first seen when [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] contracted them to steal Captain America's [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and Batroc finally succeeded.<ref>''Captain America'' #302–303. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] then hired Batroc's Brigade to battle [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Baron Helmut Zemo]] then hired Batroc's Brigade to acquire the fragments of the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]. They battled Captain America and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].<ref>''Captain America'' #357–362. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Brigade was later hired by [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] to help him build a device that could destroy the universe and battled the [[Great Lakes Avengers]].<ref>''GLA: Misassembled'' #1–4 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Alongside Snakebite, Batroc also battled the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' #67. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Batroc the Leaper showed up as a member of a small army of villains organized by Klaw to invade [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], which included the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], the [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], the Cannibal, and the [[Black Knight (comics character)#Augustine du Lac|Vatican Black Knight]]. He was defeated by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s royal bodyguards.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #1–6 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Batroc briefly confronted [[Batman]] when he was one of the villains recruited by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] for his army. The Dark Knight defeated him (off-panel). Batroc's Brigade then face Batman, but he is assisted by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] and the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], in defeating the Brigade.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Batroc had a daughter, Marie, who is teamed in villainy with the daughter of similar B-list supervillain the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Jacinda Rodriguez|Tarantula]]. Both daughters take their fathers' respective costumes and titles. The [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] expresses his shock that the Tarantula and Batroc are heterosexual before soundly beating the two villains' offspring, tossing them effortlessly off of a building before shooting them in the heads, killing them both, noting that he also "hates ethnic stereotypes."<ref>''Agent X'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Batroc briefly served among the group of villains forcibly drafted into [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] army. But after returning to federal custody, Batroc registered with the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]],<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and was sent to a superhuman training facility located at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] in [[Virginia]] to train recruits in the [[martial arts]]<ref>''Iron Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> before being transferred over to [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref name="battledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] and Ronald Byrd | Penciller =  | Inker =  | Story =  | Title = [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War Battle Damage Report]] | Issue = one-shot |date= March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Ultimately, however, Batroc found government work unsatisfactory and returned to his mercenary life, confronting the new [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] while on a job to steal an item from the [[United Nations]].<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 5) #43. Marvel Comics.</ref> Also, he was working with [[The Man with No Face]], a mysterious being from Captain America's past.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #44. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is soon revealed that Batroc was stealing the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]'s remains for reverse engineering.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''The Unbelievable Gwenpool''===
By the events of ''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'', Batroc and a handful of other super individuals were corralled into working for [[MODOK]] against their wishes.<ref>''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #2 (April 2016) Marvel Comics.</ref> He was fine with it, figuring on earning some money until MODOK would eventually decide to kill him. There he met the [[metafiction]]al [[Gwen Poole]] a.k.a. Gwenpool who killed their team's assassin and took credit for his kills, earning her an unwanted place on the team.<ref>''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #2 (March 2016) Marvel Comics.</ref> Finding out that she has no powers and only killed the assassin through luck, after noticing her lack of skill during a fight with [[Jane Foster|Thor]], he decided to turn her in, until she convinced him that she was actually from another universe and knew useful information;<ref name=":3">''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #3 (June 2016) Marvel Comics.</ref> Batroc is surprised to realise from Gwen's information that he remembers nothing from before his first fight with [[Captain America]], Gwen explaining that he did not exist before that point due to it being his first appearance, and that he was based on [[French people|French]] [[Ethnic stereotype|stereotypes]], his [[Wikipedia]] page mentioning his name to be derived from [[frog]]s.<ref name=":3" /> Batroc then decided to make Gwen less of a liability by teaching her actual combat moves and the use of weapons, allowing her to subsequently defeat MODOK when he independently found out her secret and took over the team briefly;<ref>''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #4 (July 2016) Marvel Comics.</ref> that coming [[Christmas]], Batroc then took time to mourn the deaths of his wife and daughter.<ref>''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|Gwenpool Holiday Special: Merry Mix Up]]'' #1 – "''Gwenpool's Unbelievable Christmas'' (a.k.a. the ''Gwenpool Holiday Special'' For Real This Time)" (December 2016) Marvel Comics.</ref> After a fight with some aliens in which they did not get paid, and their base was destroyed, the group broke up,<ref>''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #10 (January 2017) Marvel Comics.</ref> briefly reuniting after being captured by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]].<ref>''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #12–13 (February–March 2017) Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Gwen learns her series is coming to an end as a direct result of choosing to be a [[Superhero|hero]] rather than a [[Supervillain|villain]], erasing an older alternate "[[evil]]" version of herself from existence,<ref>''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #20 (September 2017) Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #23 (December 2017) Marvel Comics.</ref> she convinces Batroc to let her accompany him on a heist of a [[casino]] owned by [[Chance (comics)|Chance]]; having been informed of Gwen's new-found ability to manipulate reality through the confines of the [[Marvel Universe]] existing in [[American comic book|comic books]], Batroc has Gwen catch the [[sound effect]]s as he kicks in the door of Chance's safe, allowing him to do so silently, before escaping with Chance's gold upon being caught by him.<ref name=":24">''[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #24 (January 2018) Marvel Comics.</ref> After learning from Batroc that Chance was "a ''[[Spider-Man]]'' bad guy" she had not recognised, and that they have been out "[[Robin Hood]]ing", Gwen is touched when Batroc obliviously and honourably reveals that he had put the money aside for her into legitimate accounts, and believes life as a hero is better for her than the mercenary life he himself lives.<ref name=":24" /> Accepting her series' cancellation and that future [[Marvel Comics]] writers will not provide Batroc the same caliber of [[characterisation]] he has had in ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'', instead relegating him to being a [[List of stock characters|mindless two-dimensional]] [[henchman]] and minor [[antagonist]] once more, Gwen hugs him "[[Parting phrase|Goodbye]], Georges Batroc.", and prepares to face [[wiktionary:oblivion|oblivion]].<ref name=":24" /><ref name="AV">{{cite web |first=Oliver |last=Sava |url=https://www.avclub.com/gwen-embraces-villainy-to-avoid-cancellation-in-this-gw-1821786532 |title=Gwen embraces villainy to avoid cancellation in this ''Gwenpool'' #24 exclusive |date=January 3, 2018 |publisher=[[The A.V.
