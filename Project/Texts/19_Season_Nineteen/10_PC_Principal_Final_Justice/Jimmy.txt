What happened to you, Nathan? I always thought you were a nice kid. Now you've got a gun? Yeah? Well guns are never the answer. Oh. I guess it would have been a decent answer then. Tou-t-t-t... touch√©. Nice to meet you, Classi. Oh great. So now ads are using PC for their own gain? That's a new low. I know I've said it before, but man, do I hate ads. I've got to get to the Super School News. Hey, Classi, you think you can get me my crutches? You seem like a reasonable person. Do you really wanna live in a world controlled by ads? I mean, come on, Classi. Sorry, my bad. Look, I'm a news reporter, Claaassi, and in a world where ads control the news, there's no way to be sure anyone is ever hearing the truth. What is that? Tragedy at gun show? What happened at the gun show? Classi! Thank you. I need your phone to call Officer Barbrady. And we have to get to that gun show, fast!  Kyle, I know you probably thought Leslie was a kind, caring girl. But the truth is she's just an ad.
