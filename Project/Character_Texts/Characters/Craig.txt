...I don’t know. No. No I didn’t. 
No. No. He did? Why would he say that?  Well, I've gotta go over there and- Okay.  ''Red Racer's'' on. I ''do'' watch ''Red Racer'' every day of the week! Nope.  What?! What did he say about Stripe?! That son of a bitch, I'll kill him! After ''Red Racer''. Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow. Some kid. Yeah, don't just "Oh" me! I uh...  What do we do? I've never been in a fight before. Meatloaf? Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop! How can I resist an ass so great? This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master.  Okay. Okay, okay! Respect my authority. Ugh. What was on the news? Huh? I'm gonna kick your ass! 
This girl touched my thigh. Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me. Incriminate. 
Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball. Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out! Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!  Enjoying your lunch, nerdo? Get him!  Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole. That's the point, buttpipe.  Oh my God!  No! He's my friend! 
No, you don't! 
 What? You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?  This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line. Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line. Craig. It's Spaceman Craig.   Take ''that'', kindergartners!  Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them. I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor. 
...Come on, we wanna see the ass people. 
Don't you have a VHS of it?  
Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb. 
 What's going on? Oh.  
I don't know. Why? Yeah. It kinda does.   That's true, huh? Man, that really makes me reflect on ''my'' pets. Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you. Yeah! Sure is! Hah hah hahah hah!  Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be?  I'm sorry for fighting, you guys.  
It could hold a mental spell of some kind. There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage! Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf.  You're too young. Only the six of us are to go? Look out!  We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close. What? That's stupid. Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids.  
Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist? 
You guys look pretty gay.  Not as gay as us, though. Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay! Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags!  HA! Told you you guys were straight! I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite.   Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend! Take your non-flaming ass to some other school!  Everyone knows it's true! Is so!  Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are. 
Yeah, little bitch! 
Where'd you get those? Uh-uh, they're not ''that'' cool. Aha!  At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead. So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle? You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor!  I am not Craig,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya! Lose who? Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding? Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here! To hell with that! Butters! Butters! Butters! Where the hell are you?!  You guys! It's Butters! We saw 'im! Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly. Butters is right on the other side. 
 No way.  I believe in Mr. Jefferson! 
Yeah! 
  Oh hey guys. Heard about your ''news'' show being cancelled. Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.  This much more than you had! Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me!  Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals.   You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl? 
I wouldn't if I were you. 
Can't believe it. 
Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us! All the other teams are worse than us. But who? He's perfect. 
Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you? 
What? I... don't believe it. Let's go take it! He got it! He got the device!  I wanna use it. You shut up, asshole. Maybe we should take it so someplace safer. 
You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria. 
Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking. Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up. ...So it's true. That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space? 
Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be ''for the person who is going away''! 
...But I hate you. 
He killed ''my'' character right in the middle of a quest! Got it. 
...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir. 
 With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice?  How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls! Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later. Yeah. That's true. You were right all along, Eric. It ''was'' Kenny. Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it!  All right, let's do this! He had cooties and he lied about it! I thought I was the only one. 
 He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy. If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.  If I could yell "tampon dickshit" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy. If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.  Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy. Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe? 
No way. Dude. He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude. 
Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play.  Dude, this game rules. Dude, what's the matter with him? Oh man, I can't watch this. How was ''that'' cheating! They did it! 
So who do they say is the cutest? You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list! You don't think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom? We got the list from the girls!  Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I? Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso!  Could somebody toss the football back? It's over there next to the ugly kids.  
Nothing!  
 
Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off. Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk? Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow. All right, let's DO IT! No, it's true. We've always hated you.   What? 
...Fine. ...Yeah. What do you guys want? You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?  You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.  "Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole."  Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys. Can we please just go home, sir? Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.  I'm being a dick? You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick? That would be great. Thank you. 
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  Oh, that's awesome. This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better. That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world. Stuff just happens. You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world. You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money. "Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there." What? I have no idea. I don't know. No. I'm not following you guys any more. Why? Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is." I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore. It's easy. Watch.  No. ...Nope. Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it. I didn't say anything. Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See?  Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes. My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen. The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  
Peru. 
Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend. 
I've been waiting for this all week. Dude, I was here first. 
Then just give him half. I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half. Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon. Just give him half. 
That's right.  
Can we have some food, please?  
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right. 
It's awesome. Oh, that's a good idea. Please sir, it's very important. Get out of here. Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids. 
I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming. Hey. Hey, I got one.  Why do girls wear makeup and perfume? 'Cause they're ugly and they stink.  Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not. Game on! 
Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Hey, here's a post about Tolkien: "Tolkien Black's Private Gym Photos"  Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack. "In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."  It's not somebody in this room. Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me. Huh? It's a rat!  There's no telling. It could be about any of us.  Nothing broke on the Web site yet. 
Yeah. We're paying for your being fat. Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?!  Where's our five dollars? It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars. 
What are you talking about? 
Hey, did you see today's newspaper? You guys made the front page. 
Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday. Jewpa what? Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts? 
So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up. Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass. Yeah. Boooo! 
Oh, we have a new cheerleader? Where? 
Hey yeah. 
Hey Tolkien. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth. 
Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet. It just looked like you cut it off, that's all. We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too.  
Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me. He ate it! Ohhhh. 
...The truth about what? ...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so. ...Okay.  Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.  Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient. I have no idea. 
It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow. I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions! 
Where did you find a red-haired cow?  Wow, that's pretty trippy. I gotta show this to my mom!  Dude, what the hell are you talking about? Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole. 
Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real. Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones?  I thought we were getting Playstation 4's. Right. Let's all get PS4s.  That's exactly how XBox people are! We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you! Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us!  Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well. They're still undecided. We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing. 
Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess. 
At Red Robin? So how do we take over Black Robin? Haha. Hey, that could work. 
Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl. Hey, Clyde. Nice score, dude. Yeah, but did you see Tolkien's girlfriend?  
What are you guys doing here? But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.  You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves. Are you guys making this up? All the pizza we can eat? All right, this better be good. You call this a party?! Your party sucks! I knew you guys were going to bail on the party. Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?  Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party. 
  Occupied. You can't call dibs on a toilet. Whoa.. 
What are you talking about?  For what? 
Where was all this? 
Yeah, it's kind of like when the princess of one country marries the prince of another. 
Dude, what the fuck? Uhh, excuse me, why are you doing this??  What? Well what did she say? Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay? But we aren't! I'm not! But I'm not gay! No, you may not! Got a fuckin' problem, man?!  I told you to stay a hundred yards from me! Goddammit! Is Tweek home? No, thank you, I just want to see Tweek. Hey dude.  Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this. Me too, dude! But there's something we can do. We have to come out and say we're gay. Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures! We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls. You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think. You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay? Hey, Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work.  I'm sorry, Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore.  Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together. It's just that people are different. That's all. What? What are you, what are you talking about? Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened. No.  Uh, look, we both know this is for the better. Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here.  You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary. This wasn't part of the plan! Dude, seriously? Seriously? What do you want? Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you! You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back? Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks! I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else. 
I wanna see. We didn't do it. 
We're never gonna prove that and you know it! We have to make him stop! How would we ever get away with it? Let's just get it over with!  
We did what we had to do. 
Why'd you say horrible shit about gay people? 
What am I supposed to do? He's not gonna listen to me. He never does when he's emotional.  Tweek. Dude, come on, you've gotta settle down.  We're not all gonna die, you're overreacting. Everything's fine, okay? Tweek- Okay, so how about you write your Congressman a letter? Okay, so write a letter to the North Koreans. Okay, well why don't you just send something nice to the North Koreans? It will make you feel better, babe. I don't know, like... make some croissants or something? Well, what do you know how to make? All right, go home and make some cupcakes, honey.  Tweek, calm down. Yes, I did see that, so I went and got you something to make things better.  See?  Hey Tweek. What time is it, dude? "North Korea doesn't have the balls to attack Tweek. They have little tiny rice balls." You've gotta calm down.  Tweek. Tweek. Tweek! ''[calms down, but is still shaking]' Let's think this through logically. North Korea isn't going to attack anyone, okay? They're not going to start a war they can't win. Okay?'' Tweek! You have to stop thinking about it. Tell you what. We're gonna go somewhere fun and make you feel better. Okay, babe, what do you want to ride first? We're gonna get your mind off politics and have some fun. Now, what's your favorite ride? Isn't this lovely, Tweek? Just look at that view! Oh, come on. Tweek! Tweek, use your brain! North Korea isn't going to attack an amusement park. You're safer here than anywhere. It's probably nothing. Everything's fine. I'm trying to make you feel better. Okay, but think about that. That actually doesn't make any sense. Tweek, honey, all week you've been freaking out, and I've been the one forced to deal with it! Tweek, North Korea isn't bombing anyone.  They would lose the support of China, and that would mean- Well, I'm sorry that I'm actually in control of my goddamn emotions, you baby!   How should I know? Look guys, Tweek doesn't want help, okay? He just wants to overreact.  Tweek, what's going on?? Nothing's gotten any better? Oh my God, how does that make you feel? Well that must be horrible to feel that way. It must be hard for you to even think! I bet it's terrible! What else are you feeling? Oh, that's a terrifying thought. You must feel trapped. Jesus, it's like there's no solution to any of this! What are you gonna do?? What can you do? That sounds so insurmountable though. How would you even start? 
You guys, we have a big problem. Somebody's messing with our Facebook page. They're spreading all these lies, saying we like, burn the American flag and pee in each other's mouths. Take a look.  Someone is systematically targeting our Facebook followers and feeding them misinformation. Yeah, but he's saying he doesn't ever get his own movie. I thought Civil War wasn't supposed to happen until Phase 3. 
Come on, Tweek. Hurry! Don't take that crap, Heidi! Let Cartman have it! Dammit. 
[pats him on the shoulder] There there, Tweek. Everything is going to be okay. Tweek's having a panic attack. It's just your imagination, Tweek. But wait, isn't Stranger Things just like that movie-? We'll help you. Yeah. It's Pandora. '80s' channel. "Hold On to the Nights" Richard Marx, 1988.  Oh, yeah. That's better. Dude, maybe your brother didn't even go looking for the President. 
Divide four by six? ["Report now!"] 
Why do we have to do this now? 
Hold on! You guys are using e-scooters on Halloween too? 
Dude!  Dude, what the hell are you doing?! Get off of me!! Yeah, 'cause you got a stupid box on your head!   My anxiety? Well, I have to admit: sometimes, when me and Tweek are together it's... it's like he wants my atten-  
You're out of the hospital? 
Dude, our parents seem really bummed out. Yeah. Last night, my mom had a ton of holiday spirit and then passed out. She hasn't gone to buy me any presents. 
Are you nuts?? 
Um... so does Oprah drink the same blood as Obama, or is it usually a different kid?  I guess 2021 is gonna be just like 2020. 
We burn down the cafeteria? We didn't fucking do anything. Alright, dude, can we lay off the Matt Damon jokes, please? They're just getting old.
