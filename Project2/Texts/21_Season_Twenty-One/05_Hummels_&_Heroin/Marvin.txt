 Finally you're here to visit. Did you bring Grandpa a present? Awww, Merry Wanderer  These Hummels suck! It's okay, Billy. I'm just gonna need you to deliver another one of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows. You don't understand how it works in here. Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch. You do what she says, or you pay the price.  Shhh, quiet. They'll hear you! What do you want me to do, Billy? You see Ms. McGullicutty over there?  Whoever has the best Hummel collection is top bitch in this place, and she's got the best. She's ruthless, and she has those old lady farts. You know old lady farts, right? Where they're so loose they don't even acknowledge they happened? Oh, Ms. McGullicutty. How are you feeling today? Oh, yeah, here, I I just got it, huh. Here you go.  That's my grandson, uh he he's worthless. I told you, she has all the pull in here. You go against what she says, you end up in solitaire. You finally come to visit and leave after 10 minutes?  Oh, Ms. McGullicutty, heh heh. How are you? I'm giving you Hummels. What's it matter where they came from?  Billy. What are you doin' here? Heh.  Billy, Mrs. McGullicutty's Hummel collection. You got it for me. Yeah. I just might be able to. I told you, Billy. These Hummels hold a special power with old people.  Go on, get out of here. Yeah. I think it will.   Now you know how we do shit in the nursing home. Thank you, Billy. Now if we could only take down the real douchebags who profit from all this.
