==Fictional character biography==
The operations of Wild Pack and Silver Sable International drive the national economy of the fictional small European state of [[Symkaria]]. The name ''Wild Pack'' had been used by the mercenary squad led by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] for some time, until a legal notice forced them to change it to ''Six Pack''.<ref>{{ Cite comic | writer=[[Fabian Nicieza]] | penciller=[[John Romita Jr.]] | inker= Dan Green | title=Cable: Blood and Metal | issue= #1 | date=October 1992 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

The State of Symkaria is adjacent to [[Latveria]], the nation ruled by [[Doctor Doom]]. Silver Sable and Victor Von Doom have an annual diplomatic dinner at Castle Doom, situated in Doomstadt. Apparently, the friendship between the two states is deep-rooted and dates back to World War II.<ref name= "wildpack4" >{{ Cite comic | writer= Gregory Wright | penciller= Steven Butler | inker=Jim Sanders III | title= Silver Sable and the Wild Pack| issue= #4 | date=September 1992 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="marvel_sable" />

Sable's cordial diplomatic relationship with Doctor Doom once proved almost fatal when the annual dinner happened to fall on the time when Doctor Doom's castle had been overtaken by an alien impersonator during the [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]] crisis.
