Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately. Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago. Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.
