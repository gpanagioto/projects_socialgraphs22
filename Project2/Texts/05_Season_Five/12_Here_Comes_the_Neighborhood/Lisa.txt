Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do? Why? What happened to all their money? Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie? Indeed. So we must plead with him:  "Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy." "I want a llama, Daddy!" "Please, Daddy!" "Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!" Twenty million dollars great. Oh no, we're going shopping. How barbaric.
