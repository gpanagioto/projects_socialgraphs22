-----


In front of Cartman's house. Jimbo, Ned, and the boys are waiting for Cartman.

Liane

Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.

Cartman

Okay, Mom.

Kyle

Ready to go hunting, Cartman?

Stan

Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?

Jimbo

That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.

Liane

Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.

Jimbo

Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.

Ned Gerblansky

Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?

Liane

Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy.

-----


The other boys laugh.

Cartman

Dude, that's sick mom.

Liane

And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away.

-----


They laugh some more.

Cartman

Drive, Drive!

Liane

You give your mommy a kissy.

Cartman

Drive the car damn-it, drive!

-----


In the Humvee.

Kyle

[In a slight falsetto.] Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.

Cartman

Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.

Stan

Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.

Kenny

(Maybe she'll suck my dick.)

Jimbo

Oh, ho, that's disgusting.

Cartman

You piece of crap, I'll kill you!

-----


Cartman starts fighting with Kenny.

Jimbo

That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.

Cartman

Eeeeenh!

-----


He is about to strike Kenny again.

Jimbo

Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.

Stan

Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.

Jimbo

You what?!?

Ned

mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.

Kyle

I like chocolate milk.

Jimbo

Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.

-----


Jimbo drives the Humvee up a small mountain very close to town.

-----


On the mountain.

Jimbo

Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.

Cartman

Hey, I didn't get a gun.

-----


Jimbo hands him one.

Cartman

Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam

Stan

You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.

Ned

Were you stationed in Da Nang?

Stan

Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.

Cartman

Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.

-----


They point their guns at each other, Jimbo rushes up.

Jimbo

Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.

Stan

My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.

Kyle

Wow, that'd be cool.

Cartman

My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.

Jimbo

Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!

-----


Shoots it. It is hit and flips off the mound it was on.

Stan

Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.

Jimbo

Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.

Kyle

What do you mean?

Jimbo

You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.

Cartman

Democrats piss me off!

Jimbo

They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'

Stan

Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.

Ned

Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.

Jimbo

Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!

-----


Jimbo pulls out a bazooka, mounts it on his shoulder, and fires a rocket. All that's left of the deer is a hind leg, which falls over.

Cartman

Kickass!!

-----


Everyone is in creep position now, except Jimbo.

Jimbo

Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.

Ned

Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock.

-----


A rabbit hops blissfully into view.

Jimbo

[Drops to the ground.] Let's move, moove!

-----


He hustles off to the right. Ned follows.

Stan

Is this hunting?

Kyle

I guess so.

Cartman

Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.

Kyle

What?!

Cartman

Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!

-----


On the ridge.

Jimbo

This one's yours Stan.

-----


Stan aims at the bunny, but it just blinks at him. Jimbo coaxes.

Jimbo

[Calmly.]It's coming right for us.

Ned

It's coming right for us.

-----


Stan focuses. The bunny blinks.

Kyle

Shoot it Stan.

Cartman

I got your back, soldier.

-----


Stan lowers his gun.

Stan

I can't.

-----


The bunny hops away.

Jimbo

What the? What's wrong with you?

Stan

I don't wanna shoot the bunny.

Jimbo

What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.

Stan

I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.

Jimbo

No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.

Cartman

Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.

Stan

I can shoot you, fat ass!

Cartman

I can shoot you too!

Stan

I'll kill you!

Cartman

I'll fill you full of lead!

-----


The mountain rumbles.

Kyle

Hey, what's that?

-----


South Park Center for Seismic Activity, Randy is humming: another day and all is quiet. A rumble is heard in the distance, but Randy is dozing off. A stronger rumble rolls through.

-----


Randy checks the seismograph.

Randy Marsh

What the heck is this?

-----


He places a call.

Randy

Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check.

-----


He looks out the window at the volcano, which shows a column of steam.

Randy

Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!

-----


Dramatic music builds, then Randy...sips his coffee.

-----


Night on the mountain.

Cartman

My weenies won't cook.

Ned

Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm.

Jimbo

Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.

Ned

Mmm, yepper.

-----


Ned pours gasoline on the fire. The flames run up the stream and set Ned aflame.

Ned

Mmm, aahh, oh.

Jimbo

Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!

-----


Ned drops and rolls. He knocks the gas can over, and the flaming gas blows up the Hummer.

Stan, Kyle

Whoa!

Jimbo

Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?

Ned

Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.

-----


Cartman is now cooking his weenies over Ned's burning body.

Cartman

Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah.

-----


City Hall, The following morning.

Chef

But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?

Mayor McDaniels

We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but...

-----


The intercom beeps. She answers.

Johnson

Mayor, the geologist is here to see you.

Mayor McDaniels

My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.

Johnson

No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.

Mayor McDaniels

Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!

Johnson

I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker.

-----


Long pause.

Mayor McDaniels

Just send in the geometrist.

Johnson

Geologist...

Mayor McDaniels

You are fired, buddy!

Johnson

Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you.

-----


Randy enters.

Randy

Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.

Mayor McDaniels

What does this mean to the town?

Randy

Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.

-----


He points out relative damage levels on a chart.

Randy

Right now South Park is here.

Mayor McDaniels

My God!

Chef

Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!

Mayor McDaniels

Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? [Beeps out.]

Ted

Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted.

Mayor McDaniels

Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. [Thump.] Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.

-----


Back on the Mountain. Jimbo is telling stories.

Jimbo

And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.

-----


Ned extends his prosthetic arm towards Cartman as if to show that shot-off arm is now at the campsite, climbing on Cartman.

Ned

Mmmowwwh.

-----


Cartman flinches, and the others laugh.

Jimbo

Hah, got ya.

Cartman

Heh, tha-that's not scary.

Kyle

You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!

Cartman

Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!

Jimbo

Hey Ned, hand me that gin.

-----


Ned opens up the icebox and tosses a bottle to him.

Jimbo

You boys want to tie one on?

Kyle

No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.

Stan

Yeah, Cartman's pee.

Cartman

Hey, you would taste my pee!

Jimbo

What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?

-----


Kenny reaches for the gasoline can and chugs away.

Jimbo

Christ, look at that little bastard go!

-----


Kenny hiccups.

Jimbo

Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!

Stan

Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.

Cartman

Hey you guys. I know a scary story.

Kyle

Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!

-----


Softly, slowly, flashlight ready.

Cartman

Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt?

Stan

Whatabutt?

Cartman

Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.

Stan

Why?

Cartman

Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.

Kyle

Deformed how?

Cartman

Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...

Stan

A hook.

Kyle

A knife.

Cartman

No! A piece of celery.

Stan

Celery?

Cartman

Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy.

Kyle

Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!

Cartman

What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink.

Stan

Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.

Kyle

Yeah, give me that flashlight.

-----


Kyle takes it and turns it off.

Kenny

(Hey, what's that?)

-----


The volcano rumbles again.

Kyle

What is that?

Stan

Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.

Cartman

Hey, it might be!

Kyle

Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand.

-----


The others laugh.

Cartman

Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!

-----


Jimbo is now playing his guitar.

Jimbo

Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.

Ned


Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
[Uncle Jimbo cries]
Mmmoh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah...



Cartman

They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!

Ned


...Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah.



-----


Next morning. A rooster crows.

Kyle

Stan, Stan, wake up!

Stan

What, dude?

Kyle

I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.

Stan

Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?

Kyle

They're out fishing with Kenny.

Stan

With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?

Kyle

Well Stan, you want to know what I think?

Stan

What?

-----


Kyle farts, and is pleased with himself. Stan does nothing.

-----


In the fishing boat.

Jimbo

What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!

-----


He throws grenade, killing a fish.

Ned

Mmm, got it.

-----


Kenny throws a grenade, killing four fish.

Jimbo

Great instincts boy.

-----


Stan runs to the side of the lake.

Stan

Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!

Jimbo

Who? The fat kid?

Stan

Yeah.

Jimbo

Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!

-----


Ned fires the load and a massive amount of fish float to the surface. The boat lands a second later

Jimbo

Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.

Ned

[Rowing to shore.] Moh man it smells like dead fish here.

Kenny

(A little like a vagina.)

Ned

Em-moh man, that is nasty.

Jimbo

Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.

Kenny

(Thanks.)

-----


Stan's head drops.

-----


In front of city hall. The media is now present.

Newscaster

The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.

Crowd

Yeahhh.

-----


They sound more excited than agonized.

Individual in crowd

Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!

Newscaster

Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?

Mayor McDaniels

All we know right now is that some of our children [Sob-sob.] are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?

Newscaster

Huh?

Mayor McDaniels

Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 [Melodramatically.] All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.

Chef

Come on everybody. You got to help the children.

-----


On the mountain.

Jimbo

Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.

Ned

There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.

Jimbo

Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.

-----


The volcano rumbles.

Jimbo

Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.

Ned

Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.

Jimbo

Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!

-----


Fires at the ram. Kenny takes over.

Jimbo

Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.

Kyle

Look!

Cartman

I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.

Ned

Mmm, what is it?

Kyle

Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.

Jimbo

Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.

Ned

We'll be on the cover of "Guns & Ammo".

Jimbo

This calls for some HJ-14.

Cartman

[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.

-----


Jimbo is now armed with twin shoulder rockets.

Jimbo

Fire in the hoooole!

Cartman

Holy crap!

-----


Cartman jumps out of the way. The rockets hit the mound and debris goes in all directions.

Jimbo

Damn it, I think I missed.

Cartman

What the hell is wrong with you people?!

Jimbo

C'mon, let's move, move!

-----


Cartman sees them coming and backs away.

Cartman

Hey, wait, aah!

-----


Rescue Center.

Mayor McDaniels

Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!

Randy

Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea.

Mayor McDaniels

Huh, what?

Randy

Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely.

Mayor McDaniels

And, that would be good? Right?

Randy

Uh - pretty sure.

Mayor McDaniels

Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!

-----


On the mountain. Jimbo and the others have lost sight of Cartman.

Jimbo

These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! [Shoots a bald eagle.] The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.

Kyle

[Sees Cartman still dressed as Scuzzlebutt] Look, up there.

Cartman

You guys, it's just me.

Jimbo

Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?

Stan

Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?

Jimbo

I can't tell; let's kill it!

Cartman

Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume.

Jimbo

Kenny, you take the front.

Stan

No!

-----


Stan takes the rifle from Kenny.

Stan

I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!

Jimbo

That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!

Cartman

You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!

-----


Townspeople digging trench.

Newscaster

As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.

-----


Rescue Center.

Officer Barbrady

Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please.

-----


Mr. Garrison starts the film.

Host

Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a [Film skips] May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.

-----


Jane backs up, pulls out the blanket from under the food, and throws it over her family.

Host

That's right Jane, duck and cover.

-----


She ducks under the blanket herself. The lava rolls over the family, causing no harm. The blanket flies off, revealing a sparkling family.

Host

So what will you [Film skips] -do when you hear a volcano erupting?

-----


Two boys on bikes look alarmed. They leap off their bikes and hit the street, duck, and cover their heads with their arms.

Host

That's right, duck and cover.

-----


The lava rolls over the two, causing no harm.

Host

Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.

Officer Barbrady

OK, any questions?

Chef

That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!

Officer Barbrady

That's enough out of you!

-----


On the mountain. Cartman moves further up on the slope and turns around.

Stan

I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.

Cartman

Hey, seriously you guys!

Kyle

[Hushed.] Kill it, Stan. Kill it. [Normally.] Come on Stan, kill it.

Stan

Ah, damn it, I can't do it!

-----


Jimbo swats Stan behind the head.

Jimbo

You pansy! give me that gun.

Cartman

Hey!

Stan

Cartman?

Cartman

Goddammit, don't shoot me!

Jimbo

What the Sam Hell?

Cartman

I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.

Ned

Mmm, so much for the cover of "Guns & Ammo".

Jimbo

Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-

-----


Boom! Lava begins to bubble out and flow.

Kyle

Whoa!

Ned

Mmm, holy crap.

Jimbo

The mountain! It's blown it's top!

-----


A boulder of lava lands in front of Kenny.

Kyle

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

-----


Kenny steps out from behind the boulder.

Kenny

(Nope, I'm okay.)

-----


Kenny sees his arm on fire.

Kenny

(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)

-----


The boulder rolls onto Kenny.

Kenny

(Ugh.)

-----


On the side of the mountain.

Townsman 1

Look, the volcano.

Townsman 2

Quick, duck and cover.

-----


They do. The lava sweeps them down the mountainside, burning them to the bone.

-----


At the base of the mountain, Jimbo and the others are moving quickly.

Kyle, Stan, Cartman

Aaaaah!

Jimbo

That lava's coming right for us!!

-----


Behind them a river of lava charges down the mountain.

-----


Looking on from the edge of town.

Chef

Oh no, look.

-----


At the trench. Jimbo and the others have made it out of the mountain, but their way into town has been cut off.

Jimbo

What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!

Newscaster

It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.

Mayor McDaniels

God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-

Cartman

Help!

-----


Scuzzlebutt appears and scratches his belly.

Jimbo

Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!

Cartman

What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!

Kyle

Oh my God! Look at his leg!

Patrick Duffy

Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.

Jimbo

Quick Ned, shoot it!

-----


Ned aims, but no shot is heard.

Ned

Mmmoh no, out of ammo.

Scuzzlebutt

Grrrr.

Mayor McDaniels

What... is that thing?

Chef

That's Scuzzlebutt.

Mr. Garrison

Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.

Officer Barbrady

This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.

Jimbo

Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed.

-----


Scuzzlebutt rips a tree from the ground, bites off a limb...

Kyle

Aaaaah!

-----


...and molds the tree into a-

Stan

Whoa, he built a wicker basket.

Jimbo

Hey, he's saving us.

-----


Scuzzlebutt puts the group in the basket and lifts them over the trench.

Scuzzlebutt

Grrr.

Liane

Scuzzlebutt saved the day.

Randy

And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.

Mayor McDaniels

Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?

Randy

Uhh...

Denver citizens

Aaaaah.

-----


South Park. The ordeal is over.

Mr. Garrison

South Park is saved.

-----


Cheers go up.

Kyle

Hey look, Kenny's okay.

-----


Kenny appears on a mound nearby.

Kenny

(Hey guys, what's goin' down?)

Newscaster

And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.

Chef


Mmmm
Baby every time that we kiss,
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava,
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat,
Lava so warm and red and wet,
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.



Newscaster

Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?

Mayor McDaniels

Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.

Scuzzlebutt

Friend.

-----


Scuzzlebutt presents flowers to the Mayor.

Mayor McDaniels

Oh, how sweet.

-----


Stan shoots scuzzlebutt.

Stan

I did it, I did it, I finally killed something.

-----


He smiles, proud of himself. Unfortunately, this took place during a live report.

Newscaster

Oh my God! What has he done?

Mayor McDaniels

Turn off the cameras!

Stan

Hey, that was easy!

Patrick Duffy

Noooo! Why God? Why?!

Jimbo

Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!

Stan

What?! Why?!

Kyle

Yeah, make up your mind, dude!

Jimbo

Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?

Stan

No.

Ned

Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm.

-----


Drops his gun, which fires one last shot as it hits the snow. Kenny is hit.

Kenny

(Oh, no!)

-----


Rats are hot on the trail.

Stan

But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.

Jimbo

But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?

Kyle

Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.

Stan

Yeah, [He drops his gun.] it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.

Cartman

Yeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.]

-----
