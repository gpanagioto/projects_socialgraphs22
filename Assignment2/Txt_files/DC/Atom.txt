The '''Atom''' is a name shared by five [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].

The original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] Atom, [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt]], was created by writer [[Bill O'Connor (comics)|Bill O'Connor]] and artist [[Ben Flinton]] and first appeared in [[All-American Publications]]' ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #19 (October 1940).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=31}}</ref> The second Atom was the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Atom, [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]], who first appeared in 1961.

==Fictional character biographies==

===Al Pratt===
{{Main|Atom (Al Pratt)}}

The original Atom, '''Al Pratt''', [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #19 (October 1940).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/67 67]-68 |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent |url-access=registration |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref> He initially had no superpowers; instead, he was a [[midget|diminutive]] college student and later a physicist who was depicted as a tough guy, a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference. Pratt was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]], later gaining limited super-strength, and an energy charged 'atomic punch'. He died in the charge against [[Hank Hall|Extant]] during the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Beatty, Scott | first = Wallace, Dan | contribution = Atom I, II and III | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 30 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 }}</ref>

===Ray Palmer===
{{Main|Atom (Ray Palmer)}}
The Atom introduced during the [[Silver Age of comic books]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #34 (1961) is physicist and university professor '''Raymond Palmer, Ph.D.''' (He was named for real-life [[science fiction]] writer [[Raymond A. Palmer]], who was himself quite short.) After stumbling onto a mass of [[white dwarf star]] matter that had fallen to Earth, he fashioned a [[lens (optics)|lens]] which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size. Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from the white dwarf star material of his costume, controlled by mechanisms in his belt, and later by controls in the palms of his gloves. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers within his own body. After the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]],'' Ray shrank himself to microscopic size and disappeared. Finding him became a major theme of the '''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]''' year-long series and crossover event.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Paul Hoben===
Prior to Ray Palmer's trip to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Jungle]], he learns his wife [[Jean Loring]] has had an affair with her colleague, Paul Hoben. Palmer and Loring got a divorce. Later, Palmer offers his blessing to the couple when they marry, and he offers Hoben his size-changing belt so that Hoben can protect [[Ivy Town]] after Ray returns to the [[List of hidden races in DC Comics#M|Morlaidhans]]. Adam Cray would later steal this belt; Hoben never uses the costume or name of the Atom.

===Adam Cray===
<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->
[[File:SuicideSquad46.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Adam Cray, ''Suicide Squad'' #46.]]

'''Adam Cray''', son of the murdered Senator Joseph Cray, first appeared as the Atom in the pages of ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #44 by [[John Ostrander]] (August 1990). Cray was initially believed to be Ray Palmer in disguise by members of the team. Cray had been recruited by Palmer (who faked his own death) to apprehend the Micro Squad, a group of villains that had been reduced in size. Palmer intended to use Cray to uncover a shadowy government cabal which was using Palmer to discover the secret identities of other costumed heroes (Palmer's own identity no longer being secret). While Palmer infiltrated the Micro Squad, Cray would attract the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom so that no one would notice Palmer assuming the identity of a fallen Micro Squad member.

Adam Cray remained with the Suicide Squad briefly, serving as a secret weapon whose existence was unknown to others of the Squad. Cray saves Amanda Waller from a group of assassins. At one point, Cray approaches [[Deadshot]] about his role in Senator Cray's murder. Later, Cray is impaled through the chest with a screw by Blacksnake, a Micro Squad member who believes him to be Palmer.

After the unanticipated murder of Cray, Palmer reveals himself and defeats Cray's murderer. The ruse ended, Palmer explains himself to the Justice League, who had been searching for him after hearing rumors of a new Atom.

During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Adam's corpse is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #67 (January 2010)</ref> Following his reanimation, Adam and the other Black Lanterns travel to Belle Reve and attack [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]].<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #17 (January 2010)</ref> Adam is apparently destroyed by the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunter]]'s self-destruct mechanism, unleashing an explosion of [[Green Lantern]] energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #18 (February 2010)</ref>

In [[DC Rebirth]], Adam Cray is the son of Senator Cray and Ryan Choi's roommate at Ivy University. Senator Cray also attended Ivy and expected Adam to attend Ivy as well. He first meets Ryan when he walks into their dorm with heavy luggage and kindly introduces himself. Adam teaches Ryan how to play rugby and video games.<ref>''Justice League of America: The Atom Rebirth'' #1</ref>

===Ryan Choi===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->
{{Main|Atom (Ryan Choi)}}
'''Ryan Choi''', as described by DC solicitations, is "a young hotshot professor who's filling the extra spot on Ivy University's teaching staff. .. and who inadvertently ends up filling the old Atom's super-heroic shoes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5536 |title=DC Comics |publisher=DC Comics |date=2010-04-21 |access-date=2011-01-15}}</ref> This new Atom is based on a redesign by [[Grant Morrison]]. He debuted in the ''Brave New World'' one-shot, a preview of projects, and then appeared in the series ''The All-New Atom'', written by [[Gail Simone]]. He is later murdered by [[Deathstroke]] and his Titans.

==={{anchor|Rhonda Piñeda|Atomica}} Rhonda Piñeda/Atomica===
{{redirect|Atomica|comic book series|Atomika (books)|the film|Atomica (film)}}
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new, female Atom is introduced, '''Rhonda Piñeda''', a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] college student from Ivy Town.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #18</ref> She is revealed to be working as a reluctant spy for [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Steve Trevor]], gathering intel on the new Justice League recruits. She is noted to be "the most important member of the Justice League of America" by Steve Trevor.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #20 (July 2013)</ref> At the conclusion of the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline, she is revealed to in fact be betraying both teams; she hails from the alternate universe of [[Earth-3]], where she is a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America#The New 52|Crime Syndicate]] operating under the name Atomica. She also reveals that by placing a sliver of Green Kryptonite in Superman's optic nerve, she caused him to accidentally kill [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], with the added effect of severely weakening and almost killing Superman over time.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #23</ref>

Atomica originally worked on Earth-3 with [[Johnny Quick]] as a thief and killer. One night after killing two cops, they are cornered on the roof of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] during a storm. Lightning hits a satellite, electrocuting Johnny and granting him speed powers. Rhonda falls inside the building and lands near Ray Palmer's Atomico work, gaining size- and density-changing powers.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=Reis, Ivan|inker=Prado, Joe, Eber Ferreira, Rob Hunter, Andy Lanning|colorist=Reis, Rod, Tomeu Morey, Tony Avina|letterer=Napolitano, Nick J.|story=Forever Numb|title=Justice League|volume=2|issue=#26|date=February 2013|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> During the final battle with the Crime Syndicate, Atomica reduces her size and is killed when [[Lex Luthor]] steps on her.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7</ref>

Following the reboot of the multiverse after ''[[Dark Nights: Death Metal]]'', a new Earth-3 and Atomica are created. Atomica is the lover of speedster serial killer [[Johnny Quick]] and accompanies him on his high-speed murder spree across Central City.<ref>''Crime Syndicate'' #1</ref>

===Atom One Million===
An unnamed scientist in the [[DC One Million|853rd Century]] performed experiments in [[superstring theory]] that creates a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] and whose radiation alters his physical make-up. When the singularity threatened to expand and destroy his universe, he enters it in an attempt to save the universe but instead finds himself on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|interdimensional bridge]] to another universe as his own is wiped out, unable to stop it. At the end of the bridge, he finds [[Superman (Kal Kent)|Superman Prime]] who came to help but was too late. Stranded, he searches this universe for remnants of the one he lost, in time taking the name the Atom and joining the [[Justice Legion Alpha]] when he helped them defeat the Bizarro-Legion. This Atom's powers differ from his predecessors in that he doesn't shrink but breaks up into several smaller duplicates of himself divided amongst his mass. At atomic size, these duplicates can mimic [[Chemical element|elements]] such as gold and oxygen. <ref>''DC One Million 80-Page Giant'' #1000000</ref>

==Other versions==
===The Dark Knight Strikes Again===
[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] portrayed Ray Palmer as a major player in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' as part of Batman's resistance. He was taken prisoner by Lex Luthor and made to live in one of his own petri dishes for a period of months until his rescue by [[List of alternate versions of Robin#Carrie Kelley|Catgirl]]. in ''[[Dark Knight III]]'', He was then instrumental in the liberation of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] until killed by their leader, Baal. <ref>''Dark Knight III: The Master Race'' #1-2</ref>

===Tangent Comics===
{{Main|Tangent Comics}}
In the Tangent Comics imprint, the Atom is "'''Arthur Harrison Thompson'''", a subject of radiation testing on human beings.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=265}}</ref> The first hero in the Tangent timeline, he inadvertently caused the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] to escalate into a limited nuclear exchange that obliterated [[Florida]] and [[Cuba]] in 1962, unknown to his fellow Americans. Thompson was succeeded by his son, who was killed by the Tangent Comics version of the [[Fatal Five]], and a grandson named Adam, who, in ''Tangent: Superman's Reign'', is being held captive by Superman.

It is suggested in the Tangent series that the Atom's name was at least in part chosen because of the abbreviation of his full name "Arthur Harrison Thompson" on his barracks door to simply "A. Thom."

Also in the Tangent series, the Atom's presence as America's first superhero during the 1960s has led to a huge cultural impact, and in this world many significant points in pop culture have been effected by his presence; for instance [[The Beatles]] choose to be called "The Atomiks", further more TV shows such as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' became ''The Superman Hillbillies'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' became ''The Dick Van Hero Show'' and ''[[Get Smart]]'' became ''Get Powers''.

===Elseworlds===
{{Main|Elseworlds}}
*Some other re-imaginings of the Atom include an appearance in ''League of Justice'', a story portraying the Justice League in a ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''-type story where the Atom was recast as a wizard/fortune teller called "Atomus The Palmer".
*Al Pratt as the Atom was one of the three heroes who chose to work at the side of Senator Thompson in ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]''. When Al discovers that Thompson is really the [[Ultra-Humanite]], he joins the other heroes against the villain and Dyna-Man.
*The Al Pratt Atom appeared in ''[[JSA: The Unholy Three]]'' as a post-WW2 intelligence agent with transparent atomic flesh and a visible skeleton.
*''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'' where Ray Palmer worked with a science consortium whose numbers at one point included [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]].
*''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', after Ray Palmer is killed in the cosmic storm that nearly wipes out the rest of the male population on Earth, a graduate student named '''Jill Athron''' is given a research grant to study Palmer's white-dwarf-star-belt. She becomes the Atom and joins the Justice League.
* The [[Just Imagine Stan Lee's Robin|Robin]] in the ''[[Just Imagine...]]'' is granted transformation into the Atom evolved from an Incan rune of [[Hawkman]]. <ref>''Just Imagine Stan Lee creating Crisis'' (January 2002)</ref>

===52 Multiverse===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-2". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]] among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Atom is visually similar to the Al Pratt Atom.<ref>{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=13 | panel=3 }}</ref> Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.<ref>{{cite web

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #30, the Challengers from Beyond encountered Earth-15, a world where the sidekicks had taken their mentor's places. On this Earth, the Atom is '''Jessica Palmer''', a genius who graduated from [[MIT]] at age eight. ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis#Spin-offs|The Search for Ray Palmer - Red Son]]'' features the Ray Palmer of [[Earth-30]], an American captured by the [[Superman: Red Son|Superman of a communist Russia]]. ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' also depicts the Ray Palmer of [[Earth-6]], who through unknown circumstances now has the powers and title of the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]]. ''The Search For Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman'' briefly features a female version of The Atom.
On the newly introduced Earth-52, Atomarsupial is one of the metasimian Primate Legion <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/02/16/dc-comics-unveils-earth-53-in-dark-knights-rising-the-wild-hunt/|title = DC Comics Unveils Earth 53 in 'Dark Knights Rising: The Wild Hunt'}}</ref>

====Arrowverse====
{{main|Arrowverse}}
The [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] and [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] versions appear in the [[Arrowverse]] portrayed by [[Brandon Routh]] and [[Osric Chau]] respectively.

=====Ray Palmer=====
* Ray Palmer first appeared as a recurring character in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''{{'}}s third season. He is introduced as a brilliant scientist with an I.Q. of 140, 4 PhDs, and the CEO of Palmer Technologies, which used to be Queen Consolidated before Ray bought and rebranded it. After his fiancé, Anna Loring, was murdered by [[Deathstroke]]'s soldiers during the second season, he vowed to never let anything like that happen again. To achieve this, he devoted much of his efforts to building an [[powered exoskeleton|exo-suit]] with built-in weapons and flight capability. He also had plans to rebuild Starling City and rechristen it as "Star City". He hired [[Felicity Smoak]] to work for him and eventually started dating her, which made [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] jealous. After successfully building his suit, Ray discovered Oliver's identity as the "Arrow" and his affection for Felicity, so he planned to apprehend him. Upon learning Oliver was being framed by a criminal who targeted Felicity next, Ray saved her. Though he was shot during the rescue, he used micro-technology to save himself. By the season finale, Ray broke up with Felicity and assisted Oliver's team in defeating [[Ra's al Ghul]] from destroying Starling City before he was apparently killed in an explosion while working on new technology for his suit. In season four, Ray was presumed dead, leading to Starling City being renamed "Star City" in his honor and Felicity inheriting Palmer Technologies. In reality, Ray survived via his micro-tech, which shrunk him and his suit to a miniature size. He attempted to contact Felicity, with no success as she had left the city when the explosion occurred. However, one of his messages was intercepted by [[List of Arrow characters#Damien Darhk|Damien Darhk]], who captured Ray and attempted to use his technology for sinister means. Once Felicity eventually discovered Ray was alive and in Darhk's captivity, she worked with Oliver and his team to rescue him and restore him to his normal size. Upon learning that Star City largely did not care about him following his apparent death, Ray chose to maintain the deception until he could figure out how to move on with his life.
* Routh appeared as Ray during ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''{{'}}s first-season episode, "All-Star Team-Up"; wherein he helped the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|titular character]] combat [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|a villain using a swarm of robotic bees]] to attack those who ruined her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/arrow-without-oliver-producers-preview-the-rise-of-black-canary-atom-and-brick-120140918/ |title='Arrow' Without Oliver?

In the first season, he is recruited by time-traveler [[Rip Hunter]] to help him defeat the immortal [[Vandal Savage]] across the timeline as one of his "Legends". Believing he wasted his life and wishing to revitalize it, Ray accepted due in part to his enthusiasm and optimism overriding his lack of practical experience, which occasionally presented itself throughout the show. While working with the Legends, he used dwarf star-based technology to grant his exo-suit the ability to shrink to miniature size and grow to gigantic proportions like his comic book counterpart<ref>{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2015/01/cw-looking-to-expand-dc-comics-universe-with-atom-tca-1201347223/|title=CW Eyeing 'Atom' As Next DC Series – TCA|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=January 11, 2015|access-date=January 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2015/01/exclusive-arrow-executive-producer-marc-guggenheim-talks-brandon-routh-atom-spin-off-show/|title=EXCLUSIVE: ARROW EXECUTIVE PRODUCER MARC GUGGENHEIM TALKS BRANDON ROUTH ATOM SPIN-OFF SHOW!|publisher=Nerdist|date=January 11, 2015|access-date=January 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113202347/http://www.nerdist.com/2015/01/exclusive-arrow-executive-producer-marc-guggenheim-talks-brandon-routh-atom-spin-off-show/|archive-date=January 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/02/arrow-flash-spin-off-cw-new-superhero-series-1201382466/|title=Arrow/Flash Superhero Team-Up Spinoff In Works At CW; Brandon Routh, Victor Garber, Wentworth Miller, Caity Lotz Star|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=February 26, 2015|access-date=February 27, 2015}}</ref> He also assisted in turning the Legends' historian ally [[List of Legends of Tomorrow characters#Nate Heywood|Nate Heywood]] into the superhero Steel and entered a relationship with Damien Darhk's daughter, Nora; eventually going on to marry her and leave the Legends in the show's fifth season so they could live out their lives together.<ref name="RouthLeaving">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/08/22/brandon-routh-courtney-ford-leaving-legends-of-tomorrow/|title=Brandon Routh and Courtney Ford are leaving DC's Legends of Tomorrow|last1=Yang|first1=Rachel|work=EW.com|date=August 22, 2019|access-date=June 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823075051/https://ew.com/tv/2019/08/22/brandon-routh-courtney-ford-leaving-legends-of-tomorrow/|archive-date=August 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{See also|Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)}}

Choi later made his live-action debut in the 2019 Arrowverse crossover "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]". He is depicted as a scientist who works at Ivy Town University and a fan of Ray Palmer's with previous experience in miniaturization. He was recruited by Ray, [[Elongated Man]], and [[Iris West]] to help them save the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] from destruction due to his status as a Paragon before joining six other "Paragons" in defeating the [[Anti-Monitor]]. Following this, Choi returned to his family.

====Animated====
* In ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', Ray Palmer appeared in his own episodes and in the [[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure#Justice League of America|Justice League of America]] segments along with [[Superman]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], and [[Hawkman]]. He was voiced by [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]], who would be better known a decade later for his role as Dwayne F. Schneider on the sitcom ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]''.
* Ray also made occasional appearances on ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' voiced by [[Wally Burr]].
* A futuristic version of Atom named '''[[List of DC Comics characters: M#Micron|Micron]]''' voiced by [[Wayne Brady]] appears in [[Batman Beyond]] two part episode  "The Call", he is a member of Justice League Unlimited. After a rather intense but successful training session, Micron got a distress call from an unknown source about a monorail gone haywire. After saving the only person on board ― its driver ― he tried to prevent the monorail from colliding with another coming in the opposite direction. Micron disengaged the train from its track, and then derailed it. Right when he tried to get out of the plummeting train, the door suddenly closed and a force-field barricaded Micron inside. The train crashed into a building, leaving Micron badly injured. Little did he know that the person responsible for the wreck was Superman, who was under the control of Starro. Micron was placed in a stasis field, where he slowly recovered. Sometime later, Starro/Superman tried to sabotage the field and finish Micron off. However, this attempt was promptly interrupted by the other Leaguers. A battle ensued, and Micron mustered enough strength to get out of the tank, and snatched Superman with his magnified hand. However, he was still feeble, so Superman easily knocked him unconscious. Micron was then returned to the stasis field, where he most likely recovered in short time.
* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter Pt. 2" [[Vandal Savage]] mentions his attempted theft of one of Ray Palmer's inventions resulted in the death of everyone except Savage.

In "Dark Heart" (written by [[Warren Ellis]]), Atom helps the Justice League disable a [[grey goo]]-like alien weapon known as the Dark Heart which uses nanotechnology to replicate its forces. He manages to disable it, which also deactivated its forces. The Atom's final vocalized appearance was in "Clash," when he examined a device built by Lex Luthor which [[Superman]] had mistaken for a bomb. In "Panic in the Sky," Atom was shown in his small form unconscious before Supergirl's fight with [[Galatea (Justice League Unlimited)|Galatea]].
