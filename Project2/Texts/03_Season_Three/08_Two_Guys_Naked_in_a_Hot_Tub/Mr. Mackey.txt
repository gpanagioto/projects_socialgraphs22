Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm. Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.   We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts.  Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.  Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week. Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub. Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy? Hm huheh, that's okay.  Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay?  Would you like a meteor mai tai? Well, are you sure you have to leave so early? Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay?  Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
