  Hello, is this City Wok?  Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.  Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny. That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is ''so'' cool. A- AIDS? Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now. Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.  It's a cash cow, I tell you. Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done. Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt? I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid! That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off. Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be! ''He used to be fat but not no more [Butters brightens up]'' ''[slowing] and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.'' Uuuh, school project. Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny! So how long until we can joke about it? Wugh, that's a long time to wait. Then eat your puke. Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it.  Get a hold of yourself, man! Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.  The ''fat'' one! Just like Jared. Sir, we are in business!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!  Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.  Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!  Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business. Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several. I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars. Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that ''I'' should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea. Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap! No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt! Check. That should blah  Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man! Alrighty. Alright, I think it's in.   There it goes.  Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.  Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good. Oh, whoa. Whoa!  Oh, crap! Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are! Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever. Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.  Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money. Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine!  Eh.  Well hello? Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it. Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad. Ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch. Bring it on, queer bait.   Hello? Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom. Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure. Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.   There you are, Butters! No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time! No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone! Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat. Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back.  Butters, it was my pleasure.  Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.}}  Look you guys, Butters is asleep. Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.  Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh. You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is ''so'' funny! So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler. You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone? Shh-shh, here he comes.  Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?! I don't smell anything. Do you guys?  Yeah, well, that's why they call it ''Ass''pen.   His name is Thumper? Ugh, no more.,  Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body.  That's awesome, Kenny.  Aww, sick dude! Oh YES!!  Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  You wha- Really? Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow! Uh yes, I'm ''sure'' I can convince him to come on the show.  YES!  Hey, ''I'' know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crazy masks and special effects for their dumb movies. Yeah. Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. ''He'd'' put balls on ''his'' chin. He was such an awesome friend. Yeah. Nice. They look great on you, Butters. They really do. Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls.  Okay, here's your ticket  God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys? Buh-ters! Buh-ters! Testicles and scrotum!  Uh oh, we're losin' him. Oh, that was close. The present. Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"? Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole! Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world? What's the new topic? Oh. Hey, I'm out of control! Uh, sure! Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and potpourri, and queazies.  ...my, my mom? Mmoooomm? Could you do me a favor? Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt golf course in the wwoooorrlldd? I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you? Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother. Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother. Jeez, that girl is pissed off.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe? Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!  Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.  I'll do what I waunt! Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!  What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt! I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!  Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time!  Aaahh!  They look so delicious.   Memememee! Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious. Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too? Alriiight!  No, Uncle Jesse, no!  What? What the hell are you guys doing?? Where are we going? What? Why? So? Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass", "butthole", and "douchebag". I really don't feel like you guys's friend.   Oho! So you ''need'' me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering Playset! Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass.  Just give it a little kiss and I'll help. Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it. Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it. No, it has to be Kyle.   Oh man, that was soho awesome! Hell, I'm not goin' with you!  Heeeey!    You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset. Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off. O! At least I ''have'' an ass, Jew! See? Maybe they ''want'' to become sweet juicy veal steaks. I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood. Eh!  Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling.  Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer. I want out. Yeah! Wait-what?  Oh, God-damnit you guys. We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?! Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again. Can't go on. Need... food... There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf. All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters.  Food! Look you guys! Beef jerky! Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy. Go ahead, that's more for us.  Who's the hungry man? Hippies! What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!  Talk to me Mike. Sure, sure. What do you have in mind? Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike. All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -  We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye. Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.  Hello. All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf.  Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?!  We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here!  Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else!  Mike, speak. We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us? Good, good. Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike. And Worf? Step back! Tell those men to step back!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, and you must refer to me as "Captain." No. See, you must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?" You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.  "Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"  Okay, all set! Step on it, Mr. Worf!  Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!  "Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?" Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.  Oh, it's a double-cross!! What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf! Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are! Thank God we stopped it in time. All right! Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are? I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd! Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name?  Stan, okay. What's your name?  Kyle. What's your name?  Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break. Amen. What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated.   Dude, do you wanna see the Terrance & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that?  Okay, how about ... that?   It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole! I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.  Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!  Huh. Ohmigod! Huh. God, when is this gonna get to the commercials?  Argh! We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.  Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih! There, you got it, you got it! Oh, thank God. We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials. This TV is great, Chef. Aagh! God-dammit!  This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that. Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me! Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it!  Here we go! That's it? That's all the commercials? Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now! Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people! Eewww! God, I '''hate''' old people! And '''my''' house is being fumigated!  Leave no doughnut behind!  Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding! The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on!  These commercials are all so God-damn stupid! You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.   Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too. You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to see. Yeah, it sure does! I'll do it. Butters, could you take a seat, please? Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation. Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap," so to speak.  Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out. I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo... Lame, yes. Yes, well, we weren't.  Who cares?  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions? Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.  ...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop.  We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...  All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay? Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to? All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out!  Next? Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody. Alrighty then.  Uh, what's the question again? Five times one is of course... Five.  Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!  All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle? Just one more rose, Kyle. All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out!  Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!  Next please. If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained? Very nice.  You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap! All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next!  Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron? I think Towelie is awesome. Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered. Tolkien's a smartass. Yeah. Do we really need another one?  Oh, thanks Jimmy. Alright Jimmy, see ya.  Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend.  Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to?   Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all! No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room! Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff. Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow! If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person! Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss... Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?  What the fuck is this?!  I got RIPPED OFF!   They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep.  Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!  Heheh, okay, okay. Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!  Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up! Tweek! Where are you going? In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one. We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves. Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.  Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word! Is it her? Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Hemmm... No, just a bunch of goo. There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.   It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium! Well if they found somebody else's sea ''men'' in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too. G'night, guys.   You won't believe it! Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK!  I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety. That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can ''really'' see them thrive. Tweek! You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in. Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men. Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men? Do you have them or not? What's your name? Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound?   Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five. No, gallons. Dammit! Give me all you've got, then!   That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek? And I've got the sea men.  Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley. Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  Nothin' to do now but wait. Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah. Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!  Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god. Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea. I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever. What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?  ...So? Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares? Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room. That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people!  Yeah! Go!  Oh God-damnit!  Oh no! Oh the humanity! Why can't societies just live in peace?}} I don't know. Ih... in our... butt?  Maybe... No. Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing? Hm. Aw, dude, I think I might have it.  It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right? Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm? What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius. Have you ever tried it? I bet you twenty bucks it'll work! Okay, let's go, Jew!   God, let a man crap! I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!  I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around. Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!   You owe me twenty bucks, dickface! Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice.  It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!   I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills. So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!  Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm. Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.  That's stupid and immature, Cartman!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters! So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  O-hoo, what's that, Kyle? Heh...  what?  Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.  Yeah, we want our money back! You asshole!  Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit. Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we ''thought'' you were a team player! Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU! Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up! Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here.  Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up. Well we can just make them out of paper. It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!  TWEEK!! How many hats have you made? We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out! They're gonna kick your ass, Tweek!  I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.  Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them. But just remember that I do all the talking. Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it. Just now -  What could possibly go wrong?   Yeah, we're children. Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted. Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence? Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative. He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?  Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well. People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?  Alriiight! Get it, Tweek! Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it! Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.  Hit it, Tweek! ''[Tweek goes over to a boombox and presses the play button, then returns to the group. Caribbean music plays] In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, there's a lots of-'' ...No, he has an icy heart. It's a ''cool'' island song. Oh, do we wanna do that? Wow. AY! Man, that new version must have sucked balls. That and youth. Those guys are old.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket. It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket. It puts the lotion back in the basket!  Put the lotion in the fucking basket! Yes, mom?  No, our teacher's dead. Remember?  Two weeks ''isn't'' enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.  But I wanna plaaayyy! Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home? Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears? It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt. Yeah, may be. Right, heh. Woohoo. God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone. Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert!  Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk.  Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met. And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process. And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend. Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you. And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you and some peanuts.  And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip. Pleeeeease???  Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?   See, and this is Precious.  Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again." Heheh, yeah. Now say it again, louder. Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket! Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!" Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious! Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!" You bitch, I'll cut your throat if-  We're playing "Lambs." Bebe's boobs? So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was? What a stupid bitch! }}  One please. Dude, relax. Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him? So weak. So weak, dude. Man. At least I'm not a stupid Jew. Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah. You bet your fat clown ass it is!  ...ticket stub? Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?  GODDAMMIT!!! You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember.   Kenny!!! Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!  What the ''fuck'' is closure?! You turned him into a teapot? Wewewewewewe... Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe... ...Kenny?  Kenny?! What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?! God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix! Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?! Hmmm.    Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning! How? I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car.  ...No.  Ey! Euuugh.  Wha-uh, what?? What? I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off. Do you think? Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.  Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet! Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough. Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them. You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O. Because Jews don't believe in heaven! Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it. AH!  ''In the ghetto, <sup>in the ghetto</sup>. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, <sup>in the ghetto</sup>'' What did you say?! What did you say?!  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina? I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.  You're a- stupid Jew.  Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.  Shut up!  Shut ''up!'' That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me. I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body. Looks like I've come to the right place. Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that I need sucked out, please. Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium!  Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out! Eh!  The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  You guys! YOU GUYS!! You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket!  I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere. I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW!  Not by giving me brain damage!  AY!... ...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.  ...Oh Jesus Christ. Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God!  Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now! It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way. Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire.  And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew. Jews can't be Paladins. Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense? Man, that's crap. And so the party returns home after completing their great quest. Prepare for battle!  This sounds like a really important quest. This... is so cool. Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house.  And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house. Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen.  ''You're'' gay! Yeah! The one tape must be returned!  I must say I agree. If this copy of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.  Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.  We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape. Thank you, High Elf of Paragon. Clyde's a dick. Kevin, god-damnit..!  Talangar the Black returns from watching the video.  My God, this thing must really be powerful.  Quiet! You're acting like a bunch of assholes! Yeah, stupid.  Shut up, Kenny. A dark wizard must be trying to stop us! Yes, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--  It's Butters. Yes. He's been following us for like two hours.  Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away. There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up!  Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water! I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water! Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter! We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what "lost" means, stupid! '''''Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!''''' If that was possible. We're screwed. The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well. And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.  Pakistani.  No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?  No, it was Kenny! Ey! Aw man, this is awesome!   I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!  Look, a covetous Jew! Ey!  I'm not fat, I have a different life choice. Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass!  I'll take three lunches today, please. It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC.  Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work. Nothing.    Kenny. Shut up, Kenny. Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!  Hey you guys! How's it goin'?  What the hell are you assholes doing here?! Oh, about a month. He's gone again.  That was Kenny laughing, not me. Kenny! Thanks, asshole. Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass! Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ! Oh, good.  Oh for the love of Christ.  No, Kenny, it's not funny! Right now? Whoa, whoa, watch it lady. Ahh, Aahhhh!   Hey, ah I feel a lot better. God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland! It's still at baggage claim!  Who's this asshole? Then how does he know our names? Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes ''this'' douchebag? That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!   Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was ''you'' guys. I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock? Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer? That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since. Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you.   God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh? Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is in''flicts'' those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way. Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about five bucks? Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop. Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches.  Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents. Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house. Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom. Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice. Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school. The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office. Your parents will drive all the way out to the school discovering that no meeting is actually taking place. And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop.  What? Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches. Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog. Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?  Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it? I am a professional, suh!  Don't worry, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied. Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop! ¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba! Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado. Marrado. Spectacularrr. God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far? Yearh, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice. Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! ¡No come la taco la trabajar! Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off. Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ¡Vamonos! Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby. Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I ''should'' think about who I'm going to become. Who the hell are you?  Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful! Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want! You're done? Yeah, so how's it look? But I'll still be getting presents this year, right? What?! Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one?  It was nice for Tolkien; he laughed for like 20 minutes.  God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch! Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!  Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night! Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it? Jesus Christ!  I'm just letting you guys know how special you are to me. Oh my God, that's it! Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunates! Follow me!   Oh, this'll be the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too. They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to ''give'' it to them.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you! The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else. Really? Wow!  Get the rest of the stuff you guys! You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunates!  Now come on! ''Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!'' Wow, is that where Santa lives? Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?   Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well. That's what I thought. Hooray! No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He ''can't''. Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!  Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll! It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool. Oh, Christ. Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas! Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet- Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh! ''I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-''  I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.  Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate! ''[resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...'' Jesus! This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people. This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys. ''Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-'' Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means. Oh, God-damnit! Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again!  Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease. Yes, this Shitty Wok  Shitty Beef...   Hello! City Wok! City Wok, I take your order prease! Welcome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try Shitty Chicken today? You want the Shitty Beef? Which one? I see two fat friends. ...Why? Oh! You mean like-a Jared?!

Welcome ta Shitty Wok. Take your order prease. He lose weight eating Shitty Wok? Oh no, no way! I not putting no Jared in my Shitty Wok commercial! Don't you know? Everybody hate Jared.

They gonna kill Jared downtown right now. Oh boy, this is fantastic! I so grad AIDS is funny now. Sure 'kay. I pay you fifteen dowlars. Hey, I'm not a-Subway, I Shitty Wok. Shitty Wok don't have... million dollars. Okay.  Hey, you kids know why chicken cross the road? 'Cause it has AIDS.  I don' build wall. I just own un' operate City Wok.  Oh, I get it. Just because I Chinese, you think I build wall. That i' bullshit! I'm not stereotype, okay?! Just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I go around building wall! I'm just a normal person like all o'you! I eat ahrice and drive ahreally slow, just like the rest o'you! I'm not stereotype! Hey. Hey hey!  God-damnit, how come every time us Chinese put up a wall, stupid Mongorians have to come and knock it down? Okay. Finary.  God-damned Mongorians. Eh. Eh, eh, there we go.  God-damned Mongolians!! You break down my city wall last time!! Hahahaha! My masterpiece!  Oh! I'm going to get you Nogodians, if it's the last thing I do! Ah. Hey daw. O'er 'ere. O'er 'ere, dog. Got som'in sweet and souh foh ya.  Good dog! That's it! Keep licking, dog! Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians! And now I'm gonna make you PAY! Awright, Mongolians! Your only way through this wall is through me. This is my rast stand! I'm gonna do my war dance now.   Aw, you'd better not say what I think you're gonna say. Oh, God! I hate this whole shitty! Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken. Okay, Not-Kenny. Dude! That's today! Excuse me? Could we get through here? Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?  Them? Oh, "A I D ''E'' S," aides. Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial. But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular. It matters, dude.  That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised. Tha- that's diarrhea. That's a great idea! But Butters isn't fat. Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared! ''City Wok brought him down to a size 4.'' Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast. Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters. You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise.  Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny. Wow! He looks great! Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok. Because ''then'' you can pay ''us'' to use our friend in commercials. Yeah, we're all set. Well, what do you mean? Wow!  Yeah, you're still fat! Why are you doing this to us?!  Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip. Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision.  The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat.  Alright, it's working! It's out of control!  To City Wok so we can make our money. God! Yep. Wow, that was pretty good. We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos. Uh, why not?  You're all making a mistake! Aw, just forget the whole thing then! Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams. No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes ''them'' pee. What? Go on, Ike.  come on, Cartman. ...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are. Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?! What do you wanna do now?  Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude. You don't even know Heather! Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose ''another'' friend. I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are ''you'' two douches.  Awgh, dude, I can't look.  Good job, dude! Mom, Dad! Yeah, what a stupid sport!  Okay, Not-Kenny. This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick! Cool!  Do you think they'll believe it? Awesome! But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin? Yeah. Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters! We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with ''my'' parents. They'll never know. We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool. That looks awesome!  Episode I sucked balls. Yeah, he sure is. This is gonna be awesome! Wow! Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!  City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms. Aw, dude.  Then why the hell do they call it "veal"?? What?? Yeah.  Come on, we've gotta go! 'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole! What?! Screw you, Cartman! No! Have Butters kiss it. Awww!  Sick! I felt it on my face!  You need to freeze some of your ass off. What?  Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how. Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house? Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him! Butters had that at his house? All right! Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan? You're getting in pretty deep, dude.  So what happens now? We're with you, dude. We're with you, Stan.  ...No I won't. Well ''you'' made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and ''be'' angry, you baby calf-killing bitch! Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them... Cartman, stay away from that door! But we ''will'' have to sleep, dude. Good night. We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.  He might be right, dude. All right! Yeah! And fried chicken!  We're eating, dude. Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.  You guys, check this out!  It is? Huh, what the hell is that? Dude! Those gaywads are on our side? Dude, are you okay? Dude, maybe we should end this. Don't give him anything! Dude!   Stan's getting worse, you guys.  Stan! It worked! They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay! Mexico here we come!  Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on. Oh no! No!! Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Whoa, dude. But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause. Do we have everything? Look, it's almost time. It's the biggest night of the year.  Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway. You'd miss the new trailer? Kyle. Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break. Dude, thank God for stupid people  Just don't mess with it, Cartman. Just just leave it alone. God-dammit Cartman! You broke it! God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house! We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet.  No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it!  They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer. But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage. God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house. God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother! Heuh, the commercials!  Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show. Get it back to normal, Chef! The TV left. We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology! We're not too late!  They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer '''again'''! Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retarded Russell Crowe show! That's disgusting, dude! It's okay, it's still the show. Oh, dude, I don't know how long I can take it. Will your sister let us watch it? Look! Crack addicts with a television!  Oh Jesus! '''Now''' where do we go?? Well why not?! This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?! The last commercial break is starting! What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing? That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay! They were wearing cowboy hats!  It looks even better than their first movie, huh? Who wants to tell him? Lame. But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were. We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up. Phew. Hm, he took that pretty well, I think.  Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.  But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell lame jokes.  Timmy. Pip. . Tweek. This looks pretty good. You're such a fatass, Cartman!  Tolkien. Timmy. Tweek.  Pip. Towelie. Jimmy. Anything that'll impress us, Tolkien.  Well Tolkien was a definite winner of the talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there. Yeah! Isn't this great?! Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything. Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on. So? ''You'''re a smartass! Good point.  Cool. Just stick it on. Yeah.  Yeah. No way. Nuh uh. No way. Only sixteen dollars? They ''can't'' be cool if they're only sixteen dollars.   Ah, alright. I told you, Cartman.  Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning. See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed. Oh God! Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable! We don't know who else to talk to. Wow, I guess this really ''is'' a big deal.  Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright. Ms. Choksondik stinks inside.  Quick. Hide.  Got it! It is? Oh, really??  I'm so glad we're not murderers.  Whoa.  Whoa. Well what are ''you'' gonna do? Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman. Huh. Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us?  ...Yeah. So? Hey! It's Tweek. The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side. Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.  Hey dudes. What are you guys doin'? In your butts? Why would he put anything in your butts?  Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation. Yeah. Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week! It wouldn't work! I don't need to. It wouldn't work. You're on, fat boy! Well, Cartman? Well, go on, smartass, and do it! No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth! Get the fuck out of here! What?   Go fuck yourself, Cartman!  Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass! So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature!   It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a freakin' medal?! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  So?  Cartman, there's something I need to tell you. You were totally, one hundred percent right. You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend. No, dude. Spielberg changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C. Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were! Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now. Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club. "Free hat?" Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.  Tweek! It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they be''lieve'' in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats. We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers... What? Yah. You?? Why? Me. Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up! We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane. Ah, we thought ''we'' were speaking for the children. Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''!  No. NOO!!  Nonono! We need to do ''this'' first. We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?  This looks like the right room. That's it! Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. ...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, r-tard. Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song. It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is.  You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed. When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society. Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film!  What?? Yup. Come on, Tweek! Blow it up! Yeah. I I think so. ...What?  Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice. She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay. Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her. I don't know.  Dude! Bebe is really smart! Yeah, it's cool. Yeah.  That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-  I'm showing her.  Hoh! Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-  Hah hah hah! We were throwing rocks at cars. Maybe she's in the lunch line. Yep. Right. Yeah. Huh?? Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning! No way! Tweek's cool! I can't wait to watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' with Bebe.  Hoh hoh hoh! Is Bebe home? What the hell are you doing?  Bebe, I thought we were going to watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' today. Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs? But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me. Boobs are stupid! It will. So? Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out! But, wait. Where's the other team?  Dude, we weren't playing anybody.  You're such a fatass, Cartman. Yeah, it was like four days ago! It was such a long time ago! Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember. We ''know'' he's dead. We mean, where is his body?? Yeah. Closure. There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny!  Alright, we made it! Let him out, Cartman!  Is he in there? I ''knew'' Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot!  Why would they play such a cruel joke on us? Goddamnit! There has to be a way!  A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny. Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard. Cartman? Cartman?! Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?! Maybe you got brain cancer.  Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back. Do you see anything? Grandma?? Huh?  What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?! Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!  Hey Kenny. You're too fat to be Kenny. What?? For God's sake, why?? Are you gonna burn me? Jesus Christ! You did, dude! You drank his whole body! Yeah. Good job, fatass!  What do you mean, fatass? Do you see anything? Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home. Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now. Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy. Whoa.  Kenny, you in there? Stop him, Kenny!  That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one! But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?  Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph! I'm a Paladin, Cartman! Quick! A monster of Rivendell!   The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish ''The Lord of the Rings'' returned to them. Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest! Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like ''Lord of the Rings''.   Butters, what the hell are you doing?!  Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us! This copy of ''Lord of the Rings'' made the young Butters behave quite oddly. Oh, crap, the sixth graders! You can't keep it.  Dude, that video ''is'' making people act strange. We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape. Hide!  Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed. Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do.  We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... ''The Lord of the Rings''. This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.  Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.  Paladin! We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.  We were almost killed. Hey, what are you guys doing?   You guys. Somebody is following us. Butters? Jimmy, are you sure? They're gonna take ''The Lord of the Rings'' from us. Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost. Oh brother! No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before. Oh no! They're closed! Finally.  It's over. Butters! No!  It has to go back!  Let go of the tape, Butters! Fine!  Middle-earth is again safe. Funny. Not him!  Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat. Hey guys, can we talk to you?  Uhh, not cool. Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay. "Fat tits." That's a good one. Bad. Gays, I guess. Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass. We don't ''wanna'' be gay bashers, Chef. Uh, a bear?  Eh I, I don't know what else to paint. Aaaa!   People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!  Oh.  Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care. Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix. Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care? We're going to New York?  Oh cool. We get to watch a movie? We have a dead friend. Yee-yeah. ''I'm'' Kyle.  She's here? Oh my God!  Grandma's watching me. Always watching me. Four white birds! There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard. So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday? I'm not going back. I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants! He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma! You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.  You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.  Throw it away, Clyde!  Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something. What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say? ...Where did you have sex with her? Wow. That's pretty cool. 'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows. Hey, what happens to ''me'' in the future?  What are you doing, Cartman? What's it? That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this? Mr. Hankey!  Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq. But how are we gonna get to the North Pole? Yeah.  Me neither. Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman?? Finally! Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes? Wow, cool! Is that what this is all about?!  Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing? What are you doing? Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down! All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that! We don't know. They lost all contact with him. Jesus, behind you!  You bastards.  On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel.  Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!  Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh! Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll! Dude, where have you been? Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with.  Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches! Hey Kenny. We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny!  What kind of help? I'll bet you can. Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.  Then City Wok could say ''their'' food makes them lose weight. He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster. ''Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls.'' Marry him?  Chef, we need more food.  Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed. How do you feel, Butters? Alright, now it's time for phase 2. We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world. Did you bring the camera? That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches. Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!  Did you eat only one ounce of City Wok like we told you?! All prepared for liposuction surgery?  Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault. We've gotta hurry this up.  He's losing weight.  Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home. Dude, bail!  Come on, Butters. Time to go. What? ...Kenny would have done it. Alright, it's settled. Come on, Butters.  That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared! What?! Wait. Everyone ''hates'' Jared now? Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out.  No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has ''assistants''. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides. Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials? Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!  Oh God-damnit! Why? Well, so much for our money. He's such a douchebag.  Yeah, and then what? They're still asleep. What's a Hitler? No, I never have. Smell what? Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess. Uhh... no. Stan. Marsh. Dude, I'm just learning. I never said I was. ...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza... Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.  Oh no. Heather?   ...who ''are'' you people?! All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone? Okay. Yeah, prob'ly. Fries... fries...  Thanks. Who are you? It seems fine. Don't care.  I dunno. Oh,. God.  Gah, let's go you guys.  Dude, what the hell is your problem?! I raced you, You won! What? I'll be there, you queen! Yeah! Dude, I have to! Dude, he's got Heather! I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be? ...Thank you. This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!  Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13. I have to do this, okay? I have to! Pizza... pizza... pizza... Thanks.  Where the hell have you guys been?! No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks!  Hm, that sounds pretty good. Hey Kenny!  Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povich freak show is on. Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so ''we'' can win a prize! What disease should we say?  This is gonna be so funny! We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you ''think'' we were talkin' about? It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.   Where's you get the balls from? Wow! All right, the original AVID cut of ''Star Wars: Episode I'' That's your flight, Butters. Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV. Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend!  Here he comes. But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!  Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you? Yeah, they wanted to find you bad. I- told them where to find you. Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over.  Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows?? Yeah, I wouldn't have. Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.  Pst, Cartman.  Cartman, wake up! We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass! So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us! We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because ''friends stick together''.  Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!  Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us? Go on, dude it's the only way. Just do it really fast, and we can go. Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on! Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?  Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.  Go! They're gonna murder you. Come on, you stupid baby cows!  They aren't leaving. Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back. Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house. I don't know.  We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over. Butters!  Did you bring it? What? Aw crap!  That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people! They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die. No! You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the ones who knew we were making little baby animals suffer!   Kiss my ass! I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.  Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.  Shut up, Cartman. Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman. Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this. This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until we know the calves will be safe.  Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in. Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours. We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes!  No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf! Wait, what is that?  Dude! See? Now we can hold out for weeks!  Dude, what are you guys doing? You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!  That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again! No, this is exactly what we wanted. Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.  ...I don't believe it.  What are ''they'' doing here? Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores.  No! Hello? Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do? What do I say?? Cartman, no! O-ogh...  It... did? Pick me up. I... I want to see.  We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried! Well, I guess we learned something today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.  This is gonna be so awesome! Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anything! Alright, here we go. Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!  It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie! But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow. But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe. Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!  O-K, deal.  Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch. Dude, I'm not going. Stan. Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up? They look fine to me.  That's worse! Dude! Dude, the commercials could start any time! Get all the stuff!  We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on!  Hurry! We can't miss the commercials! Huff, huff Aww!  AGH!   Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels? We made it! Here they come! I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the ''first'' commercial break. Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon.  Oh God-dammit! Come on, we gotta go somewhere else!  The bar! They've got a TV at the bar! We made it. But we have to watch the commercials in this show.  Commercial Break Number Two!  I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break. Oh, God, it's horrible!  We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go! Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it '''is''' being fumigated! Turn it on! Turn it on! Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at '''my''' house! She has to!  Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute! What? The last commercial break has to be coming any second!  We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house?? Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later!  We made it!  Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be?? Wait a minute! Look!  "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it! That looks AWEsome!  Oh, dude, let's go! I wonder if it's all a western?  Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you look for friendship opportunities elsewhere. All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the ''new'' person to take Kenny's place.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.  One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy. All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck. Okay, next?  Yeah, it's not bad. Next?  Shut up, fatass!  I like it.  Okay, let's try this.  Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend?   Oh, this is giving me a headache.  He's quiet and he takes direction well. Really the perfect friend. How about Token?  That's great. Suckup. Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek.  Just put it between its eyes. Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?  Oh, hey Butters. Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters. Uh oh. Alright, I'll chip in. Ready. Let's see 'em. Are they playing basketball?  Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish. What are we gonna do with them? Yeah, that'd be funny. Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened. Oh jeez, change the channel. They found the sea men! It's only a matter of time before they find the women, too! We're dead! Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are! Chef, we did something kind of bad.  We need you to promise not to tell anybody. We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach.  This is it. Yeah, stupid. Dude, it's probably still in her stomach.  What do we do now? Do you see the sea people. Yeah. Aaah! Let's go!  The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee. ...and then we put them back in the tank.  Oh no, what now?  How? How did that happen? They've already accomplished so much. Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture. Well, drop them in!  That's cool.  ...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose? Hm. Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come. Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything. Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue!  The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue. That sounds pretty fun. What are they talking about? Um, cool. ...Like ...money? What? What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts?  We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest ever put anything in our butts. We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out. Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt? What? Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth. You've had five, dude! Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth. What? He did. Yeah it does.  So? Dude, look. Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again? Oh, cool. A preview.  Aw, dude, why would they do that? That's gay.  Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies? Goddamnit, that pisses me off! Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified! We have to do something. Let's form a club. No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with! Well what's wrong with it? Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats.  What? Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there! Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.  Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause. Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone.  You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause? Aaaah,  Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference! Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat. ...212, 213, 214 members! Really? That's great. If we go on ''Nightline'', the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films. When did we do dibs for it? Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now? Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas ''and'' Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.  That is our understanding. It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies. Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of ''Raiders''. Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves. Okay, go.   Aw, really? Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song. So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song. Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films.   You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours. Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it. Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys!  He's definitely lost it.  You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.  Yuh, you guys okay.  Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here.  Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world. Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it. Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again. Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something? Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.  Ah, hey, Bebe. Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us. Hella fun. Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe. That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool.  So what you do, see, is you wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing.   Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now- Hoh hoh hoh!  ...Wait, what were we doing again? Hey, that's what I wrote about!  That's such a great paper!  Yeah. Uh huh. That would be best. Kyle?? Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out! No! Yeah! Sure thing, Bebe. Yeah.  Where are you guys going? Bebe is ''our'' friend. Didn't you all get the memo?  Hoh! Aw alright, I guess we can all watch ''Terrance & Phillip'' together.  Cartman's?   Hoh, hoh hoh hoh! Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh! Hoh. Hoh?  Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.  Ahta. Ah, ahta!  Ahta. Ahta. Ahta?   Friends. Ahta. Ahta!  Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs. Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions. I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us. I hope this movie doesn't suck ass. Child Tracker? ...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker! I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?! Huh? But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.  I'm not done with my pizza. Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker. But why do I have to leave? Where are we supposed to go? Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid. Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai.   Uh huh, Stan Marsh. }} We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree! Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub? Because our names were called on the commercial last night! We've gotta find that ticket! Where's Kenny??  Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.  Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there! I can't see.  It was a trick! Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot! We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over!  Cartman, come on! Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!  We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven. Because we wanna see Kenny again.  Mr. Garrison threw away his car? Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it! Excuse me.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with. We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood. No. Hello?? Kenny?? God?? No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off. What?? Hey Kenny. Dude, what the hell is wrong with you?? Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree. No, we have to see Kenny! Cremated? What's that? Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny! Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny!  Where?? Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta ''spark'' the vision somehow. Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?! Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done.  Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels... Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body. Dude, come back here!  O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin? You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?  Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors! How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog? Good job, wizard. My father has asked that we bring you this copy of ''Lord of the Rings''. The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace.  We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you. Woww. We have come to reclaim the one tape!   Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too. Nothing.  Hey, kid! Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents! There's ''four'' of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body! Oh crap, dude! Ogh.  Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders. We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon. Yes, but this is not a--  But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.  Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see? What do we do with it? I will take it!  I will walk to the video store. No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember? True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store. Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about. Jimmy didn't stop them! Just get across the river! They're coming!  Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river. This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in! Where?! Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass! Closed?  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in! They're coming! Uh-oh. Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video. ...Wow.   Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body. No, no, he said ''not'' cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher. Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay. Yeah, but Dad- Yeah, I have to remember that. I guess.  Oh, no, no, no no no no. Chef, we're intolerant.  Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around them. Are we homophobes now? N-no? We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos! Tolerance camp? Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures. The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you! Butters! Jesus... we have to get out of here.  Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die. Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago. No, that's Kenny. That's Cartman. Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives. Awesome! Uh, over here please? We told you that. No no, he's trapped in Cartman's ''body''. Heh hey wait a minute dude. He seemed better on TV?  We don't get to go to Scotland?  Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.  That's us. Come on. Huh? Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually. Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave.   What?? Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap!  Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please. I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick. Jesus Christ. Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up. Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real. Right, but it's not. It's a ''trick'' you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life. Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun. No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real. No dude, you're a douche. Then you're a ''stupid'' douche. I'm nine years old. You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Kyle! Kyle! Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche. Kyle, you can't run your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them. No, he's not.  Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you? Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay? Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you. Does this month, November, hold a special significance? Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'" See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father ''wasn't'' dead, I could still say it was some other older man. I ''didn't''. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday." Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He's saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money." No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about. What?!  No wait. Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter. No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"  Stop it! I didn't do anything!  I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely."  Not literally! Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience. Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead!  No, I don't think either one of us can.  I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever! Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche! Fine, douche!  No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience. You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all  just stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I ''know'' you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to ''this'' asshole?  Yeah. There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself. No, it can't be. Oh, dude!  Now do you people believe me?  What's going on? So throw it away. You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.  It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you. Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal. Aw, come on, Mom. It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!  Who the fuck is it, Mom and Dad? I'm me from the past? Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana! What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no!   Stop it.  No. Quit it. Hey guys. This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32. Shut up, Cartman!  God-damnit! Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters. I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him. I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room! Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?  Dude, how long has ''your'' future self been around? Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself from the future?? Where is he now? Liver medicine? Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?! Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane?  Here it is.  This expires in two thousand two. Why would he have this in his wallet?  Here it is. Motivation Corp.   What the hell is going on here? I can't believe it! It's all a scam! They've all been lying to us this whole time!  Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated! They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors! It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it! Who's that? What? We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that! ...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care. But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to!  No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.  Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow? Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents! Fine, then you can come with me.  I guess this is it. Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents? Cartman?? What the hell are you doing here?! God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go.   Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business! How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?! Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol. How much is this going to cost us?  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! That's not neato, that sucks. You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought each revenge was unique and customized! Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have to admit that they lied to me! Dude! No, that's ''too'' extreme! Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing!  Hey future self. You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hole in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep? You must know what I'm talking about. Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future.  No.  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across. What?  Hide and go seek, huh?! I don't believe that he's my future self! No, I actually ''have'' a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear. But I have to know for sure.  Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it. Yes?  That's weird, because I really didn't cut off ''my'' hand. It was fake. Butters! Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here. Butters, we're running away! Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change!   Huh? Get the fuck out of here.  Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me! I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe! I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning. Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Cartman, why are you doing this? Wuh, that smells.  Uh, I don't really wanna get on there.  I don't know. Awww!  God, it took forever! Hang on, Santa!  Why would Iraqis do that? Why? Oh no. Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us! I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead. Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq! We're here.  Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. Oh my God. Iraqis killed Jesus. Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh... RPG, four o'clock!  We brought Christmas to Iraq! Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us ''all'' Haibo dolls!  Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas.  Oh, hey Kenny. Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.

So where's the part where we have a ''good'' time? Wuh, that's my face, sir. Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas? Do you think Stan has a chance?  U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you. Let's dance.  Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan? Come on, Stan!  Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead. And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!

Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it!  Yeah.  How far away is June?  Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go. Wuh well, sure.  Wull what is it? Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend. Not working out? Well, but ah I can get better. Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great.

Hu-uh, okay Mom.  I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me!  Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos!  Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!   It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order at Bennigan's. Yeh, you didn't?  Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?    So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?! Ms. Choksondik? Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.  Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand!  Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there. Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail. It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  Aaahhh! A note? Okay, Mom.  We haven't much time!  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos. Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  come back minions. Join me? But why? Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red. Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray. Now let us go look for my minions!  People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my final Labor of Loathing! I am going to... flood... the world! Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time. Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete. Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!  but now they have left me with no other choice! This is it, General Disarray. My final solution.  Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!   Hey, fellas. How are things... going with your new best friend? Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas.   Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray. Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity.  Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun! Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow. Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be!   Huh? He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original. Aww, I don't wanna do it now  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it? General Disarray, are your parents home? Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date. You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah! Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news!  Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc! I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos! Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch. Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?  Stupid Simpsons... Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  No? Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumors about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-  I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen- Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-  Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-  Dwaah!! I've done it, General Disarray. I've watched all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right? Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us! Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be. No! No!  Aaaaah! Oh sweet Jesus! Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo! Waaaah!     Haaa! Cartman?  Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha! They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it starts to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha! Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.  Compassionate. You mean, like a goldfish?   Wuuhh, it's really fun. You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me. Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.  Me too!  Stupider than Bebe! Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas? Yeah! Uhyep!  Then we gotta work on your campaign.  Oooo, they're all hard and oogey! Huh, I'm over here, Dad.  Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it! Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!

Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden? Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success. I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too. I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid.  Oh. I guess it's been about four months now. Nobody asked. Probably watching Becker. See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,- Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan? Well we both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then. I don't follow.   I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else. Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan?  Yeah, I can't believe it! This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject. Eh, but then why did they come back to the past. Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'. Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay! You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder! Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret!  Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see.   Now you know my terrible secret! Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.  Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver. How about this? Winter Park. It looks kinda nice. Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents?

I don't know which swatch I like best. Well that sounds good. Hooray! Wow! Neato! Boy, it sure is stinky in here! Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think- Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop ''off'' the walls? Uh but Cartman! Wait!

He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-''</poem> There he is, beatin' that dead horse!  Cuh-can you imagine what we thought when you said, "Aides for Everyone Foundation?" Then it's time... We can undo the banner!   Here he comes!  Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever!  Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny! Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void. They let you stay for free? Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend! Oh, do we have to do it right now? Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal. So then it's not really ours.  Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now? Wait... All right, look, we've been here for over three hours. No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay. Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are. Well, ''this'' certainly is nice. Oh, God-damnit!  Don't listen to 'em, let's just go! Let's just get out of here.  That does it! I'm calling the police!  All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave! Oh, Jesus. Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year! Stanley, they belong to him. Stan, you're behaving like a kid! Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house. We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!  What is that? What? Jesus Christ! Vaginitis?   ahem. 'Scuse me. Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests. With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests. It couldn't hurt.  You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist! Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists. Yeah!  Stan, you're an atheist now! Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food. Noho, it doesn't work that way, son. No it doesn't. Honey! Honey, come quick! Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say.   And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids. Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!  He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up. Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology. No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. }} Why? What's the matter with him? Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts. Hey there, son. Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan. Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life. But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever. I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most. If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no ''real'' power at all. Well, what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town! Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in. Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us. Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker. If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters. There, I think that's got it.  You can barely even tell you have one on. There is no other team. Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us.  Yeah, and you kicked ass!  Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years. The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you. We can't tell you because we can't know where you are!  Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you.  What's the matter?    Sweetheart, you saw the news... Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves. What's going on? What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble! Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro. Bi kute.  Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!  No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together. Yes, kids.  Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor. A ladder to heaven? Why, son? That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard. The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven. ''No'', it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny. Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.  No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough. Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but... When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes.  The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is. What?  Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven. If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons.  Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy?? No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.  Butters' parents want to borrow ''The Lord of the Rings'' video we rented. Could you take it over to them? Yeah, whatever.  Hmmm, that gets rid of them. Yeah, well uh, ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.  You wanna go watch?  You ready for some hot, steamy fun? The guys at the office told me I ''had'' to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt ''the'' hottest porno ever made."  I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that? Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready? Oh, yeah.  Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story. Oh yeah.  Yeah, it almost looks like... ''The Lord of the-- [jumps up and sits on the bed, aghast]'' '''''Oh, my God!'''''  This is ''Lord of the Rings''! The boys have the hottest porno ever made. Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet. Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape? Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast?  Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.  Okay, problem solved. Uh... Chris, are the boys over here? We...  The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.  And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape. I'm a...fraid it was... ''Backdoor Sluts 9''.  It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it? We think our boys might be showing other children a, uh... pornographic tape.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.  Where did the boys go with the porno tape? The video sandwich? What's a video stockyard, Jimmy? I know where it is!  Boys! Boys! There you are! A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal. That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting. Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it. Well, let's all get going. Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage.   Aw I'm surprised at ''you'', Stanley. I really thought ''you'' knew how to accept people for who they were. No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!    Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture. That's our Cartman.  Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys? Well I really thought you boys learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers! Oh my God. He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way ''this'' asshole was acting. We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?  Who is it, Sharon? Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!  Okay, we've had enough!  I don't know. How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.  Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you. I think he's pretty scared alright. Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us. Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself. Oh. You. You don't? Well, you know what I think, Stan? I think he IS from the future. Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get rid of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol. Oh, Stan!  Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself? Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?  Stan... Uh... nothing. Go ahead. Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand ''did'' disappear! He ''is'' you from the future! Uh..  Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too. Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are. Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorists, but... Well son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything. Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.! You really did a nice job, Eric.  Christmas is ruined again!  Stan! He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches...  ''He's '''still''' lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time...[Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]'' ''His name is Jared. Jared lost weight eating Subway, now he's cold and alone and with no place to call his home. He liked sandwiches with Philadelphia cream cheese.'' ''So much alike, and yet so different'' Thank you all so much. You know what? After a ''year'' of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy!  And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss! Sure, let 'em in.  I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side. Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so ''much'' weight was that I got aides. That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides. Would you like to meet them? My aides. Scott! Tyler!  and Tyler is my dietitian. Yep. Hooray for aides! I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides. Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter? Hmmm. Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding. Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something. Uh, Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides. Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together.  What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed? Well of course I knew it. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Aren't you overreacting a little bit? We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're ''my'' aides now, but after we get married... they'll be ''our'' aides  Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth. Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight! But,  I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't ''just'' Subway sandwiches that made me thin. The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides.  But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides!  Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible!   Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me.  ...'Scuse me... am I being fired? How so?  I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides!  I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while.  Ladies and gentlemen, a-at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation! I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides!  But I won't stop there. I'm gonna seek out all the underprivileged and hungry children of the world, and I'm going to give them aides myself! Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful child on this earth has aides by next month! Aides for everyone!  ...I tell my  Aahhh! Why did I ever do those stupid commercials? Yes. ...Y-you mean you all thought...? Oh my ''Gosh''! No no, hey it was ''my'' fault. I can't believe I- I, I didn't think of what I was saying!   Oh my God! I told my girlfriend I wanted her to share my aides - oh, no wonder she left! Oh, brother! Alright!  Mr. Fogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich? Hello. Jared, what's this all about? What?! Am I bummed?!  You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?! Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?! Not that big of a deal?! I ''slept'' with you! Well, Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married! Hello there, children. Fifty pounds? Why? Well, if you want him to get ''really'' fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him. It definitely worked for every ''woman'' I ever met. Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children.  I'm runnin' out, children.  You're gonna give ''children'' AIDS?! Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS! Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had!   Oh. Hello there, children. Uh, how's it goin'?  Pretty cool, ain't it? Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle.  Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be watching this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure. Why can't this guy control his temper? Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool features, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here-  Let's see. Menu?  Aw, dammit! I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," ''then'' "function."  No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?  Yes I read the instruction manual! So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," '''then''' "enter."}} Oh, well, hello there, children. Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on. Now, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it? ...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. ''Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh'' Wait! What the what?! Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.  ...Wait, what? Sea people? Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.  Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men. Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  Relax, children, drinkin' some  brine shrimp can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else. Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.   Hello there, children! Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode. Good for you!  Hello there, children! Good-bah!  Hello there, children! How's it goin'? Why bad? ...Intolerant of who? Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better. Children, a lot of times the reason people get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes ''me'' uncomfortable?" Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?! Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that?? You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal. You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!  Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!! He IS a sick queer!! Kiss my black ass!!  Hello there, children. Well what's wrong with him? Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner? Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital! Cartman?  Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny? Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free? Ms. Cartman, we need to get Eric to a medium who can speak with people who have crossed over. This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward. That's right. We have to go see him in New York. Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now. This must be the place. Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you. Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please? Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole! Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers. We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.  Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver. Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now. Hi Pop. These are my friends, the Cartmans.  Hi, Momma!  Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman. Yeah, Pop. This is Eric. Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing. The victim child? Where were we gonna find a child to sacrifice? What do we do with it now? Eric, you're okay!  Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast? Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny! Ladies and gentlemen, we at Subway are happy to inform you that Jared has elected to stay in South Park in order to speak to you once again!  So, here he is, Jared!  All right!  ...Huh? Uh, the opinions expressed by Mr. Fogle are not necessarily those of the Subway Company.   Jared, first of all we want to say that all of us here at Subway appreciate everything you've done for our company. Well, your new slogan, for instance.  "When it comes to fitness, Subway goes hand in hand with aides." He's going to speak with us once again! Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minestrone. Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great. Oh no!  He is so courageous. Mary was my mother!  Yes. Yeh-yes she did. M-mm-m. Not really. Huh? Oh my God! Yeah, I had the minestrone over here.  Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching. Yeah!   Ogh, that is so courageous.  Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real. Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November? Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother. What? Flood the world? And if we get a hold of the negative they can't change the movie? Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?   Oh, that's courageous.  Yes. The mu-se-um. That sounds a little too coincidental. Did he say AIDS? My God! Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!  Courageous. Yes. There's only one explanation. This kid can communicate with the dead! Is he serious? All right! Okay. All right!}}  Phew! Aaah! Woohoo!  Hear Hear!  Yes, well, it is now the opinion of all of us that perhaps it would be best for you to take your... strange theories on weight loss elsewhere.  Jared, it's just that your new take on weight loss is contrary to our commitment to good health. Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that? Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides. Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you. Butters? ''Butters''?! This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in ''our house''?!  Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!  Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?! OH, you just WAIT until I get home, mister! You don't even know the trouble you're in, mister!!  Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters! Friends, by default.  Oh, Chris.  No! ''No''! Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television! Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but ''you'' can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!  Butters, time for bed. Good morning, Butters. No,  I didn't hear about that.  Butters, a note for you was left on the front door. Here you go.  Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours! There's no way ''my'' son's going. Let's ''all'' be atheists! Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world? Score one for us atheists! Be careful out there! Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared? No, just Butters. He's been watching ''The Lord of the Rings'' downstairs. Ohh God!!  Butters?  Butters! Is that bad? Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America. Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily?   Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine. Oh my God, our house! Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault. We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth. We're sorry, baby.  Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth! Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister! Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!  Uh, do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded! Jacking it? Jacking what? WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?! Oh, you're gonna get it, mister! Just wait until I get home! Don't you "Hi, Mom and Dad" us, you little punk!!!  You think you're tough now!!? Answer me!!!  Yeah. We figure that if our boys are gonna be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too. Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has ''your'' sons to be his best buddies! And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend. No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation. Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting! Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend! Here we are, everyone.  Where are Butters and Eric? Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder!  Okay.  We'll meet you boys on the slopes.  It sure is.  What's the red sticker? O-all right! Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company? Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo! Hey look, this chair lift goes right into a building.  I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ''...did...'' just say a thirty-minute presentation. Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office. What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing?  Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke! Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!  Butters!  Butters, this is your father. Butters? Answer me! Butters! Right now! WHAT?!  What's gotten into them? I'll say! That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  maybe we can grab some burgers.  Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth. Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!  ...Same thing. Us? Your family's always been the shifty-eyed ones!  Oh, son, can you ever forgive us? Oh.  Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah. Oh, hello boys. Well, thank you very much, kind heroes. Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough.  Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: ''The Lord of the Rings''. That's our man. Here you go.  Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon. What's the matter? Butters? Butters, where is the movie you were watching? ''Backdoor Sluts 9'' makes ''Crotch Capers 3'' look like ''Naughty Nurses 2''! Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time. The video stockyard. Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?  Wait a minute. Where's Butters? Uh huh. Dumbass! Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right? Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to! Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn. Come on, let's go.  What the hell is this?!  Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?! What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son. Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib. We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son!  Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in. Tom, I'm standing in the town square where just moments ago it was declared that AIDS... can finally be joked about. What a great day for humanity. What?! Let's get him!  Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny! Well that guy's just plain nuts. You damn kids! Well, we don't know what else to ''do'', Mayor!  Steeeeee-riiike!!  South Park Cows do it again!  What the hell are they doing? Awwww.   Light the damn tree! Oh, finally! This guy's insane. Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?! You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides? He's right. It happened! People, people, calm down. Yes, but standing out here yelling "Rabble rabble rabble" isn't going to help anything.   People, what do you think we need to do? ...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city. Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!  These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible? Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays! But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing. Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy.  Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks? That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree!  Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas!  Get him!  Oh boy, do I feel stupid. Aha-  Eh- Excuse me? Yeah. Free Hat. Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place.  Can't we also work towards freeing Hat? Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free! Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha. He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat. But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison?  No? ''There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. [the governor looks up a bit surprised]'' Sure. Give that man a baby! Alright! Here's a man's fart for ya.  Oh no, hahahahahahaha. Oh, what is it?   God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer! Ey! There's some anthrax over there!  Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something. Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.  Oh. Ooo. Alright! Yay! Woohoo!  Hooray! Oh we're so sorry, Jared. A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that. I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo. Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting. Aha.  Wow, filet mignon' and lobster! Yeah. Can we go now, please? Finally, we get to go skiing! Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us ''will'' come in handy. Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody. How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo! Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back! My God, can you believe those people?! The police work for time-share, too?  Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer. Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV. You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten! It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer.  Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers! We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.   Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now. A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God.  Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven.  But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives. Kyle, that's not the issue right now. Kids! All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like ''Crotch Capers 3''? I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made.   I, uh, I-I-I read about it in ''People''. Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago. It was ''Backdoor Sluts 9''. Uh, Tolkien, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape? Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context. Stinger? Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice. Okay, boys. Do you have any questions?  I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book. So full of metaphor. Yeah, dirty lungs! That's what our boys were talking about? We've gotta get our boys back!  Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before. I knew it would be funny someday!  AIDS!  I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay? No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to ''hide'' our emotions with math problems.  M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do, uh, four times four, m'kay? Okay, and so uh,  so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?  M'kay, Clyde? Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde. M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Tolkien, why don't you read your paper?  Uh, how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is? M'kay, Bebe? M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper? M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades. M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay?   Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay? M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place?  Uh, how about you, Clyde? No helping!  M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay? Oh, this is too much to take.  Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone? M'kay. M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik.  BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison.   Good luck, m'kay. Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay? Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay? Hooray! Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.  Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you? Stole? A-a-are you sure?  Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, what are you doing with those calves? Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it! Open this door, now! I apologize for this, Mr. Rancher Person. I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life. And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promise them the calves will live free, in writing. Well excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!  That was very impressive.  Very persuasive. Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over! Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizzas and ice cream. You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in.  Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all. Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?  You're giving my baby guns? What?? I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on. That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids, anything fun happen with your whole Sunday off? Stanley!   I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some. And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here.  Oh, Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore. Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley? It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately.  He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.   I love you. A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy. Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim. It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth. I wouldn't worry about that. Congratulations on your victory, boys.  Turn it up. Stanley, time for us to get back to the house. NOW, Stanley!  Right. Do what you normally would do. Good-bye, son.  Remember to eat right. Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay. Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town off to live on their own? I know.  My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!!  Randy, can we just take our son home now?  Oh... oh, that's so sweet. You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated. Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder! See for yourself! Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy? Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you? Oho, you little ''devil''. Hey there, cowboy.  You bet I am.  Mmm, sounds good. Mm, yeah baby. Ready. Wow, the production values are really good in this porno.  But then that mean..? Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back."  The boys!  Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now. Oh, dear!  We're sorry. Boys?  Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy! See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it. How was school? Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath! That sounds good to me. Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.  Stan, what did I tell you about watching ''The Osbournes''? It's going to make you retarded!  Who are you?  Randy, what's going on? But why are you back in this time with us, son?  That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift. You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep? Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind sharing his room, would you, Stan? It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this. Well that makes sense. Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little? Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just ''feel'' he's our son, you know? Right.   S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self. Randy!  AAAHHH! Looks like you'd better ''really'' watch out for marijuana, huh Stan? Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future. He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them. Well here, Eric, I cooked you a huge box of cookies as a present. Yes, it was ''fab''ulous! Well that sounds like a good deal. Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait!  Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years! It's lovely. Thank you. Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill. For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here? Oh, you know, this ''is'' really great. Thank you.  There you are, boys! Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise ''your'' kids, but ''my'' son does not play negotiator with ''me''! HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  This is ''your'' mother! You will open this door right now!  Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!  AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!  Mmmrragh!! Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours! Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can. Oh dear God, you've ruined everything. You're giving them a missile?? All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.  An abductor in our town? Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids. But who can we get to build it? What-what-whaaat? Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you!  Oh, this is terrible!  Ike? Kyle? We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.  Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough. Oh, that's so touching.   They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!  Kyle, it's just what some people do. Oh God, this, this is horrible!  How the hell do ''you'' know?!  Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?! Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!  Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid. This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts! Hurry! Hurry! Oh, Kyle! You're safe! That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle. It's also important that you understand ''why'' some people choose to urinate on each other. Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home.  Oh, hi boys. That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play? Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals! That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance!  Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp. Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered.  Kyle! All right!  Ho!   Wow!  Jesus!   Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting? And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4. Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - "Not me, I can't afford it." But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars! Well you see, "time-share" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves  "time" you want to stay. Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, "I've got a little place in Aspen." Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary "I've got a nice little place in Aspen?" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives. Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend. Right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting.  Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at the luncheon. And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,... Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch! You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford. Of course you can. Go hit those slopes!  Oh my God! You got the red sticker! They got the red sticker! Okay, okay, fine, I mean...  Welcome back, folks! ...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving. Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show. That's only a couple thousand each, Josh! Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are ''still'' deeded properties! Oooo, you folks ''really'' lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand! That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time. That's right!  and listen to the presentation. Now, you're probably asking yourselves... "Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?" The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their- Hello. I've got a little place in Aspen. You folks enjoying the condo? Well, best to do it and get it out of the way. That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity! Wow!  Time share. Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little place in Aspen." It's downright smart! It's nice to feel rich, isn't it. And then share it with the people that come tomorrow. They got the red sticker?! Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes. We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about! And we certainly don't want to pressure you. I know! Have you ever considered going ''in'' on a time share? That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!  "What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?" Nice to meet you, "Mom and Dad."  I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass. All right, little dudes,  We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...? ''[puts his left hand to his ear, hoping for an answer. The boys just look at him] Time'', that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time. Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here.  Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together  Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name? Okay, Mike, ski down to me!  Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time! K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time. Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!  I heard that you were the one responsible for making Tad lose the race. Thanks. Iiiiike!  Hey! Imong telling Dat! Dadadadat! Etetheh bunlapala un night. It's a birdy fly. Looks like ''you'' think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid? I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat ''me''? What's your name, hot shot?  Stan Marsh  Stan DARSH is more like it. Alright, how about a race, then? You and me. OooooOOOOooo!  Looks to me like you're not a "hot shot" after all. Oooooooo! You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll ''always'' be number two!   Well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh! Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya? I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean.  Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh!  Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now! Hah! You're going down, little boy!   Yeah! Yeah! Hey everyone.  I'd like to sing a little song, if I may. This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. ''[Stan stops in his tracks]<br />Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...<br />Stan. Darsh. Darshy Daaarsh<br />Stan Daaarsh<br />Stan Darsh, Stan-darsh<br />Stan Daaaaarsh Daaarsh<br />Stan Darsh...'' A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought. Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13.  Hell, I'm not chicken! Are ''you'', Darsh?!  Oh, ''yeah''?! Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow. This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!   Now, I'll win for sure!  Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race! ...What are ''you'' doing up here? Haaaa, Darsh!  Oooooooo! Race! Race! What? Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves. You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests.  Oooooooo! OooOOOOOOoooooo!  Stan,  for what it's worth, I think you were really brave. Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be at the youth center tonight for a dance. I hope you'll come because you're just so... we-hell, you're just so.. well, that's all.  I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?  But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center.  Oh, Tad. Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract ''you.'' With these.  Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center.  Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted.  Yeah. Well he really ''flipped'' when he saw these.  Can I help you? Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks. Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building. Where are all us kids supposed to go?  Ooooooooo. He'll ski you anytime, anywhere! Yeah!   Yah.  Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits of the Wakichaw Indians can finally rest in peace.  Aaagh!!   Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!  Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God! All right, let me see if I got this straight. You two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability  ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars?! That's right, you're practically stealing condos at ''that'' price. "Book 'em, Danno!"  Sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be ''you'' people for passin' up such a great deal! Tad's got the lead.  Awwwwww!  Awww!  Awww! AAAAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh.   Where do we go?! AAAAA!! Hahahahahaha... Awesome! Oh yeah. Hi, Bebe.  Wwooww. Wwooww! Yeah. Yeah. Hey Chef.  Quaid...  Start the reactor...}}  (Hey guys. What's going on here?) (Gosh darn it, my name's not Kenny!) Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones.  You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you.  Can you tell the audience how miserable your life is?  You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?  Do people sometimes stare at you?  Do they go, "Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing"? Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music. Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance!  All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman whose head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna give her a makeover! Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin. Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado.  Thanks so much for coming on our show. So, is it tough being ...different? And do all the kids at school make fun of you? Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?  You have balls that hang off your chin. What names do they call you at school? And do they call you "freak" and "weirdo"?  Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth? Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you. Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world! Go on, you're going right now!!   Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework. Well, let's bring her out. Here's Vanity!  Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen. Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it. So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child? Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look.  Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman!  Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do? We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control.  Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that ''her'' daughter is ''also'' out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old. Let's bring her out: here's Chantal!  Wow, that is out of control! What the hell is this?  Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-  Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too! Ah, those damned freaks!  I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?!    Thank you. Uh-uh, yes. It is. Sometimes. Sometimes. Mmm-I don't know.  Yes. Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spirit gum. We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside. Wooww! Hey, hey! Stop it, man! Now we just blend the skin tones, add a little hair,  I believe you owe us payment now?  They weren't lying! Here, damnit! Thanks for coming on the show, kid. Maury is very excited to meet you. And this is the Green Room where you can hang out with the other guests until we call for you on set. Boy with Balls on Chin, meet Man with Foot on Head, Girl with Rapid Aging Disease, Disfigured Country Singer, and Man With No Face. I'll come back in a bit, folks.  Okay, Boy with balls on his chin, you're up next.  Second door on the right.  Oprah two times, Jenny Jones once, Sally Jessie five times. Yeah. Like when someone LIES about being a freak. Good, then you can march with us. Freaks of the world, Hey Roger!  What the hell is with these horrible veggie platters?! The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one. Oh, ah I ''hate'' doing the Jenny Jones show. They don't even have their own hair people. We all know each other and we kinda stick together to make sure our industry is protected. Yeah, loh-, Lobster Boy used to make appearances on ''all'' the talk shows. He was one of the most popular disfigured people on TV. So you know what we did to him? One night all us freaks got together, and we... boiled him alive.  We're glad you agree. Napoleon?  We've got big news! The union is striking. Grounded for what? Why? We're a union and we have a right to picket. ...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!  Attention Maury viewers. We did it! The strike worked! Jesus Christ! That out-of-control kid ripped poor Napoleon's balls right off! Yeah, we told you last time we want fresher vegetables. ...Boy with balls on his chin. Haven't seen you around. How long have you been on the circuit?  You've only done Jenny once? Yeah, you picked a good show to do first, kid, but you need to learn the ropes. There are a lot of people like you all over the country, and we all do talk shows for a living. Yeah, they'll make up a fake condition to go on these shows and then take ''our'' money away! But then we all found out that Lobster Boy wasn't a real freak at all. He was just an actual lobster. Now Lobster Boy is no more. Napoleon Bonaparte?  There you are, Boy With Balls On His Chin. We're tired of our crappy prizes! So the union president, Man with Terrible Skin Condition, has told us to round everyone up. Boy with Balls on Chin doesn't wanna picket.  I'm sorry, this is what the studio provides. Just take a seat on the couch, kid. I'll be back in a minute.  Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway? If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place? You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean-  Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall around our city? Nobody in town except for our good friends.  Nineteen six- Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back!  Kids? Don't you remember us? We are your parents. You used to live here, with us. Are you okay, Clyde? You mean how he said we should trust each other, or how he abducted children? I'm doing Jenny tomorrow. We don't take kindly to that. It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy.  Lying sack of crap.  Why? You're not a SCAB, are you? Phew. Wait, here it is, here it is! Hey Butters. True.   Weak! Really?  I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic. Please help my out-of-control child. Really?  Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are? Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age? Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out. Yes, sweetie? What's that, my little man? Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop. Of course I do. Sweetie, don't. I'm glad you're not like that, poopsie-kins. Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle. Oh, he's such a cutie. Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear. Oh, I mean, sex and drugs. Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food. Oh, all right. Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer.  Oh, hello boys. Oh, but I thought your teacher died. Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls.  Sweetie. You have to get ready for school. Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back. You'll get over it, honey. What's going on? I heard an explosion.  Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film. Me too.  Be careful with my baby.  You're going to be okay, baby. Is he going to be okay? Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?  Why?? What's wrong with him?? Well, what does he need? What can we do?  It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time. He's looking a little better today. Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there. Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out! It's too far and your parents want you back home. Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon. Please, call me Liane. Oh dear. Get it down. Oh, baby, your time is back! Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie. I thought ''you'' got it. Unite!  Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Yeah! Yeah! Better prizes! Now! Better prizes! Now! Better prizes! Now! Ooohhhhhhhh. Aawwwwww.  Awww.  BOOOO!! Oooohhh! Aawwww. Ooohhh! Boooo!    Ow! Why won't you kids behave?  Wha'evah, wha'evah! You fuckin' cocksuckers don't know shit! Fuck you!  Wha'evah! Maury, my mom don't know shit! You could aks her! I aks her all my homies that they be down wit it. You know, it's all good shit.  Fuck you, cocksuckuhs! Shu' up! Shut the fuck   Oh, what-evah. You ain't tough, ho! I roam with gangs! What Evah! You ain't bad! You ain't nothin'! ''I'' ditch class and go shoot heroin in the school bathroom! What evah! Whatevah. I helped in a drive-by shooting. Yeah!  Maury! Maury! Brothers and sisters, the time has come for us to be treated with the respect we deserve! We are a strong and diverse group of people, with members like  Liza Minnelli. The talk shows have us on and give us little gifts and perks while ''they'' make tens of thousands of dollars. We told the talk shows our demands, and they ''laughed!'' They say they can get plenty of other stupid guests to go on their shows! So we must picket those other guests! Who's not gonna picket?  Now, we will split up into groups and form picket lines. The first group will be led by: Incredibly Obese Black Man.  ...Oh, right. My bad. What do we want? When do we want them? What do we want? When do we want them? Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together.  What do we want? When do we want them? Now we can go on with our careers! You're not gonna picket? Excuse me, I'm not Incredibly Obese Black Man, I'm Incredibly Black Obese Man. Get him! Get him! Get him!  Okay folks, we're gonna have to move along. I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go. Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people. What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important? Mmhmm, that's right Maurih. Maurih, it's like this: Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked! Why, just last night I had three gentlemen callers over to my house, and Chantal took her clothes off right in front o' everybody! You see?  OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE! A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of ours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with "freak" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, "Look for the True Freak label"  They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey.  Oh, excuse me. I was just-  Look, I apologize, but I was just-- Hat McCullough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released! To do what?  Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness. Sir, the ratings have just started to plummet. Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher. Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.  Sit down, boys. All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five. Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.  What is it, Butters? Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go.  Okay, so for instance, children- Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?  one. Who are you? Hey! That kid took my last eraser!  Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here? It looks fine, Butters.  Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob. Hi, Rancher Bob. Eewwww!! AWWWW!!! I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me. Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death.   Hey, anybody want a free sample?  You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal. Yeppir. Well, if we called it "little baby cow" people might not eat it. Well, no, but all these ''veals'' are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store. I followed a calf-curling trail right to your house, ma'am. Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe? And when they come out I can take them back. Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday.  What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady? Oh.  Well, it doesn't matter now. In the twenty-four hours since the word "veal" was officially changed to "little tortured baby cow" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see "little tortured baby cow" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'. Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life. Hello, Mrs. Marsh. Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property. Me?? How did ''I'' get into this mess? I am. But I don't want to be. The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out. Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator. But isn't that dishonest? Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you. What do you mean? Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.  Let me hit him, Mom! Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy. The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!  That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time! No, turds! Shut up, fat turd!! We're not watching this!   There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!  All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it! And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds!  I told you I needed tampons, '''tuurrddsss'''! Yeah! Mmmmm. Hey. Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where four insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle. Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say. The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists. Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make ''seem'' important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to "Puppies from Around the World." Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict.  Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom. Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to-  It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say. Tom, people from all over the-  Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and capture the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action. But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?  This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids. Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you now. Well come on in out of the cold now.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nellie. And is this the children you told us about? Well, let's see here now.  Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there. Nellie, you best have at it now. Alright, children, stand up on this chair now. Yes, right now.  In the name of all that is holy we demand this spirit be set free! There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now! Come on out hyow! It's safe!   It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child! Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we can put Kenny's soul into its body.  God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go! Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light. Go on now, soul now! Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman! Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again! Over here! Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now. ''We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved'' ''If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.<br />For a... brighter tomorrow...'' Hooray! Hooray! All right! Woohoo! Yeah!  Who's in charge here? Where's the negotiator? All right, see what you can do. They're coming out now? All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action! Get out of here!  We'll get them the semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy. If they see that, they'll come out and then, we could take them. Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen? All right. Where is Mr. Dorn? I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help.  All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International. Do it! Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it!   Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!  Alright boys, just stay right there until your parents arrive. Ms. Stewart, we have some questions. Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad. Give me a hard line to the phone in that house!   Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology. Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you? I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right? How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other. Well, how about you send out one of the calves? Just one, that's all we want. What? I, I can't do that. No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad.  Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do. Okay. Up a little... left a little...  Almost there. We're giving the boys some guns in return for a calf.  Get them on the line for me! Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain. Well, ha- how about you send out two calves? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf. What do you have in mind? A little to the left...   Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust! How are we doin'? Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word "veal" to "tortured baby cow."  But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota. Now, now please can, can we get you to come out?  All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them. Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico. And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on "Star Trek" to drive the truck.  In full makeup. All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples. Yes! All right! Woohoo! Rabble rabble rabble rabble! Wow, yeah. Oh yeah. Whoa! Wow. Right! '''''The video store!'''''  Wow!  What the hell is going on?! This is highly unusual! My name is Michael Dorn. I play a ''character'' called Worf. Where am I supposed to drive to? Captain, where am I supposed to drive to? This whole thing is ridiculous!  We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads! Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads. I'm NOT killing anybody! Can I go now?  Mmrrrr. All right! Okay.  Nice.  No. He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis. It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy. We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.  Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too. I'm afraid he's... running out of time. It's his time. It's ...running out. He needs to have more time. Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist.  Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something.  Let's not validate his delusions. What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant! I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored.  You walked right through my shot, mate! Do you know who I am?! God-damned smartass! Do you think you could  Oh! Get up! Get up, you little pussy!  Come on! Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But it looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em. Seems like no one else here wants to fight. ...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger? Great idea!   And so here we are in history-rich Ch-ooina.   -bloomin' Taj Mahal.  fight!  Alright everyone, we're gonna take our first commercial break. But be sure not to go anywhere, because there's lot's more people to beat up! ''Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world. [cut to Brooklyn, with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. A lot of brownstones here. Russell has brought his schrub with him again. He approaches the camera]'' Oi! Now Tugger's brought me to one of the greatest places for foightin' in North America.   Why don't you choke on some pig vomit, you stupid sobs! Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight?  Oi! Crikey, you've done it now!  You fight like Norwegians, ya fairies! These are the Florida Keys, a remote island chain just a few miles from... Oi! Wait a minute! Wasn't I just in Brooklyn fightin' minorities? What happened with that? It's that God-damned editor! He cut the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm gonna get him!  Who the hell do you think you are?! I know you're the bloomin' editor! I mean, who do you think you are cuttin' one of my foightin' scenes short?! Moy foightin' is poetry! You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you testicle!  Come on, Tugger ol' mate. Why are you lookin' so down?  Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems his girlfriend and him had a bit of a row last night. Come on. Cheer up, Tugger. How can I make you feel better? I know!  How would you like me to sing one of the songs off me new album? What's that, Tugger? You say you '''really''' love the songs on my album? Alright then, Tugger.  ''You know that you're my baby. You know I need you now.'' ''I don't know where I'm goin', I gotta get there some, yeah gotta get there, somehow.'' ''Gotta get there somehow.'' ''You can stay away tonight, but I'm gonna sleep here, in my explosive clouds...'' ''SHOUT! Think I feel your heartbeat, can you feel mine... lady lookin' lovely, gotta take your love inside, gotta take it...''  Tugger shot himself! Tugger! Why'd you do it, Tugger?!  Doctor! Tell me how he is, doctor! You gotta save him, Doc! Tugger! 'E's my best friend! The only friend in the world who would-  Oi! Don't you interrupt me, you vag-oina! I was givin' a heart-wrenchin' soliloquy about me feelings for Tugger!  Oh, Tugger! Tugger, the world won't be as bright without ya, mate! Give it to me straight, doctor! Will Tugger live?! Tell me the truth! Yes, now's fine.  Crikey! Ol' Tugger looks healthy, happy, and  fit as a whistle! But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide made me realize that I should take up a cause. Most great actors take up causes, and I'm the greatest of 'em all! So, from now on I'm gonna spend all my spare time ...fighting cancer.  Right! Where is that pussy cancer anyway?! Well, we couldn't find cancer, but we found a man '''with''' cancer.  Take '''that''', cancer! And '''that'''! [punches the old man again] And so we'll be right back, after these commercials. Well, we sure had a good time today, didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen, a few peckers, and a lot of Colombians, to name just a few. But I sure am glad we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you?   Oh ya like that do ya?!  TOOOOOOT TOOOT TOOOT  Mooooot. Mooot, mooot. Mooooot.  Nooo! Nooooo! Noooooooooo!  Noo, no!       Mooot Mooot!  Mooo-oooo. Oh my God! It's Russell Crowe!  It should take about a month to achieve the results you want.  Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to be very pleased with the results.  Phew! ...taking place there all these years is sure to continue until the governments of these regions can actually come about some... Hey, look at that guy over there. Ain't that that Gladiator guy? Behind that plant, next to that tugboat?  Where? Oh yeah, I think it is.  Yeah. Oh I'm just working. I'm probably done around seven.  I'm the editor. Dude, the director said to cut it.  You ain't midgets, your lips are too full.  Now GET OUT!! Look, this is a bar! We can't have children in here. People come here for debauchery and sin! GET OUT!!!  Jesus!  Yeah! Alright! What a beautiful song.   ...What is this? Well, he's a very sick little tugboat. He's going to live, but- Sorry. ...Now? Oh. Uh, your tugboat's going to be okay. He just needs an oil change and a new steamstack. What is this? We wanna watch "Puppies From Around The World." This show is too violent! Put the puppies back on! Yeah. We don't like this show. Yeah! Please. All right, that does it! We know how to get our way! Everyone, on the count of three, release your bowels! One! Two!  AAAAA!  Woohoo!  Yeah, yeah, alright. Ooohh. That's right, that's right. Shain balag! Yeeeeesss!  I'm glad to be back, Russey!  Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe! Phew. Hey.  ...What if we don't want to be your friend?  This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game! Hey, Tolkien. You know, I never really noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool. That is an awesome answer! Wow, hella fun. That's awesome. It's weird how we never noticed before.  You try it, Bebe. Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-  Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-   My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever".  Hoh!  Chase his tail? That must be so funny!  Hey, have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere? We're trying to get Bebe to run for class president. What? Yeah! Yeah!  Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid! Let's never let boobs come between us again! Look at those ridiculous things! What do you guys want? Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you? So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage. Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble. Faragon, asshole!  And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please?  Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody. That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black. What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic?  One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. It must be returned to the video store from whence it came. It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard . Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble. I'm not gonna touch it. ''You'' throw it away. Nobody wants to touch it. And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless? Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order twenty-four is up.   Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?  Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.  Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what? Oh boy! Oh thank God!    Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket. There's some chocolates and lih-liquorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside. Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later.  Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please.  That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces. Well, where is the videotape rented from? You guys, this is stupid. Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest? They are coming.  You guys go on ahead. Go!  They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii... They took it back to the video s... the video s... No, the video suh... the video s...tih... N-n-no, you retards! The video s...tore! Well, I did Ecstasy once.  In her... va-vagina.  Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience. Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick. Alright, h-here it goes. ''On the first day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh... gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m... me... a pa... a pa... pah...''

''Eight... maids are... milking...'' ''And a p-p-par-tridge in a p-peeeaaar treeee.''   What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa! Oh man! This is too much pressure! Aaarr!  O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it! I can't.  You do it. But what if I put it in the wrong place? GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me? Arrrr! Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure!  It's not? Gah! Me too.  They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!  Jesus Christ, we killed her! Jesus Christ, she's dead!! Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys! They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man! What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it! Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!! Gnaaahahahah!  I pulled out my hair! Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"! Oh, God.   I can't remember uh-the code word!  You guys! Um, ''dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.'' ''[two people come down the hall] ...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!'' Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah! They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate. Hr! Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho. Uh-uh huh. Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure. Gaaa-hah! NOW what's happening? Maybe they wanna kill us. Arr! Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane! I'm a what?? Harrr! Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore. NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments! I'm not! I'm not a team player!  D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus! But we don't ''have'' hats! Aahh! You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end?? Fifty hats? Oh Jesus!  Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it!   Hrrr! My center. My... center.   Gaaaaah! Oh God! Aaaah! Oh God!  You guys, we have a big problem! I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I ''dreamt'' about making hats, but I only made fifteen! A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats! Goohoo!  Oh God! I gotta move away, you guys! Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me! You don't? What?  You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news! Ted Koppel wants us to appear on ''Nightline'' to talk about our cause. No it isn't, man! Thahat's ''waaay'' too much pressure! Ga-ahah! Gaaarh!  Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah! Ahah. U-uh. It's easy? Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah! Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre! No! That's it! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create!  Hwaaah! Haaah!  I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field. I'm in a field... surrounded by deer. Huh uh. Guh huh huh!  Oh God! Oh Jesus!  Aaaaaah! Oh God, no! Not Plan B!   Aaaahh!  Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president  have all been taken hostage by Steven Spielberg! Haaa!  Yes, just like Hat!! No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', and we ''have to'' rescue them! Do you understand?! No! Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God! Hello! I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg!   That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends. Except for Cartman - you can keep him. Then your premiere has no movie! Ah, what?! Oh my God! But what about the original prints of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them? Cartman likes to play with dolls?  You... guys wanted me to meet you here?  Oh God. Oh God!  Agh! God, change it!!   Aaaah!! Gahahghah! Oh God. They're gonna get me.  I s-I saw! Uuuh!  Oh God! Huh!  Oh Jesus! Huh! No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  ...Inside my room? Oh God!  AAAHH!  What?  Oh God! Oh Jesus!  Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy! So? I don't know him! You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!!   AAH! Uh... Get away from meee!  I don't know you!  Ah, AAAH! Huh uh! I'm not supposed to talk to you! But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick. AaaaAAAHH!   The Ghost of Human Kindness? What do you want? Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me. It isn't? I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world. I'll... try. Your van?  What the hell is going on? No. I didn't mean to. Triben fak burushban. Conifer? Walking there would take hours! Me too.  I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything.  Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... what is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on. What? Okay wait...  O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance. Timmih!  Timmay! Timmay!  Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh! Timmih!  I didn't make the cut?? Oh God, I didn't make the cut?? I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!  Hey Butters. I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class. I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you. Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.  I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing. Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too? General Disarray. It's on all the way. Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live? What do we do now?  What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos? Professor Chaos! I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood. What dastardly deed are we doing now?  Oh, awesome! Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons.  They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun. So how do we build it? No. What? Oh, uh... You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out. ...Simpsons did it. They did it in episode 204. Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!" ...Simpsons did it. No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that. Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!   Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! Don't have a cow, man. Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!!   Five. Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.  What's going on? Oh.  I don't know. Why? Yeah. It kinda does.   That's true, huh? Man, that really makes me reflect on ''my'' pets. Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you. Yeah! Sure is! Hah hah hahah hah!  Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be?  I'm sorry for fighting, you guys.  It could hold a mental spell of some kind. There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage! Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf.  You're too young. Only the six of us are to go? Look out!  We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close. What? That's stupid. Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids.  Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist? They're not going to pick me. I just ''know'' they're not. Really? I don't believe it.  Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please? Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then. All right!   Well, what am I supposed to do? Aaaah. Oh, I know.  I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with. I'm gonna start saying that now. Here comes a sedan.   "If I was Bebe, I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."  Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much. Yeah. What the hell happened to us?  I'm not playing anymore.    Five midgets, spanking a man... covered with Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love? How do ''you'' know? None of ''us'' had ever had any drugs before.  Drinks! Get your drinks here.  I DON'T WANNA DIE! Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh. Can I help you? Your... mom told you? We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children. Frances Velman.  We don't care about that. Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. But we ''have'' to free Hat. Hey, he's got a point there. Or is it freshen his hot temper with a cool island song? Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it!  ''...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...'' Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi.  Bene, Benedicali!  Dear Christ, who will save us? Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him! ''But here in the mountains there's no freedom like that.''  So courageous. Yeah, help me out too, 'k? We have very little time to live. How, how shall we spend our last hours on earth?   Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song! But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant. I'm next. I'm next. Yeah! All right!  Is this it? Yeah, two thirteen, that's the one.  ... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger.  Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square. The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads. This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson  took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say: The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day. And in other news, still no cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach.  The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.   The Surgeon General had this to say: The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly. The Mayor of South Park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating, young citizen  Eric Cartman will be given... a freaking medal.  And in other news, another school shooting has taken place, this time in Idaho. As these kinds of shooting increase, one thing becomes clear: Your children are not safe at school.  This was the second time a terrorist threat has been made on a theme park, leaving everyone to realize that children are not safe outside.  And it seems there's a ''new'' danger to look out for: children who are taken by strangers. The bottom line: children are not safe... in their own homes!   And so all the residents of Manhattan are prepared to evacuate if Ms. Clinton's ass gets any bigger. And in other news, new findings on the increase in child abductions. The study shows that the most likely abductors of children... are the parents themselves!  Finally, some good news tonight. It's been several days since any child abductions have taken place. The main reason: parents don't know where their children are.    Tweek! This is Officer Daniels! Now, try and stay calm, but we believe an abductor is in your room! Give it up, buddy! We've got ya surrounded! Okay, Tweek, I want you to very calmly but quickly walk to the door and come out to us! Bang!   Alright, let's just leave the semen sample next to the corpse; I wanna run a hair fiber test next.  No, that's not...  Hey, do you smell children?  One donor, certified, on record. What are you doing? Five? Vials? Www-we don't have that much here.  SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!  Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat? ...What the hell's wrong with him? That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society? Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons. What's going on now? Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys. A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.  You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?  I'm aware of that. Wow, that's... really great to hear.  Oh, for real? You're not kidding?  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!  You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.  Oh-ho, great! Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that? ...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly? Yeh-you don't say.  Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay! Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is  Mr. Garrison. Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat. But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to...  So that's  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass. Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you.  I'm not saying the rest of the school year is going to be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard.    Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...  Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!  Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead! That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment!  I will  Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner? Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy. Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?  That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.  Now we'll get fired for sure! That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! ''Twenty-five million here we cooome. [shimmies out the door]'' You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?   Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go. ...You're not? Yeah! God-damnit! This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired! No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance! I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal! Oh well-  The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget! There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet? What's the matter? Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather.  Get along, little Slave.  Ding-ding, ding-ding.  Say, Mr. Slave. I had a dream last night that you were a real dick. No no, I was the asshole.  Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls.  It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave. Uh...  Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher! Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you ''had'' to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  "Tolerate" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!  Ogh! So now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?! But this is insane! Oh no.  Parents, it's that time of year again when the bishops and priests from around the country are organizing the Young Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're taking the boys on a weekend boat trip to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator of our lives.  Uh... Good-bye, everyone. Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming. Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion. Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What?  Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right? No. No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church! Oh for the love of God! Are you all saying that you've engaged in inappropriate relations with your altar boys? We are here to bring the light of God, not harm the innocent!  I'm serious! Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help.   That's right-wait. What? Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what we should do is not have sex with boys!  Well, maybe we need to ''change'' the Holy Document of Vatican Law.  Gelgameks? Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism! Well, for one, no sex with boys.  Uh well then, perhaps we could change the Holy Document of Vatican Law to say that... it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex... with women.  Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus- I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here. Why not?! But if we locate it we can make changes to it? Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!  Ahh, hello. Uh- My name is Father Maxi, from the United States. I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it. I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, and... and that scroll may be our only hope! Very well. Here we go.     Queen Spider? Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!! You people have completely lost touch with the outside world! You sit in this big room with your Gelgameks and your Queen Spider, and none of it applies to what being a Catholic is all about!! To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican Law!!  No I didn't! All that's dead are your stupid laws and rules!  Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic. But I'm a Catholic in the ''real'' world. In today's world! It's time for you all to do that, too. It is time... for change. We ''can'' let them go, can we? Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up. Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too. You too, Tweek! Atheism has definitely made our ''lives'' better. Oh thanks, Sharon. That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying "under God" every day at school. That could really damage him. "Under God" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me.  "Under God" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance. Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV!   ...What was that last bit?  Tweek! Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center. Sit down and have some coffee, son.  Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about children being abducted, and we thought we should talk. Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. It's important for ''you'' to know never to unlock them at night for ''anyone'' except your mother and I. You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I? He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest. Did he hurt you, son? That's... not a bad idea, a city wall. Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell!  Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?  Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now.  'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here. Well, maybe things would be better if we could ''trust'' people like the Stotches! Oh yeah?!  Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey! Where are you going? Oh?  I think I'll go with you. I just want to make sure that you- Me? I would never abduct our son!  Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children.  Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are. They're starting to remember. We're sorry, Tweek! Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along. The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did. Get out of here!   Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that ''all'' priests are child molesters.  Yes? Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember? We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him. No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it. Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  You WHAT?? Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay? Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean? Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your church's priest?  Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt?  You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just, did he ever try to put anything in your butt? No, no. Did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt?  Yes, but we've got to find out why these children are suddenly finding it necessary to report that they're being molested. Stop the problem at its source. Well did any of the children you've molested come forward? Well, that's good. Well, I don't know how it's been for all of you, but attendance at my church in Fort Rawlins is down sixty-three percent!  Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public! How do you mean? Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed. I'm down almost seventy in Greenleaf. Yes, but how? Father, uh, having sex with boys is part of the Catholic priest's way of life. They've gotta know to keep their mouths shut! That's right, yeah. Yeah.   Something has to be done. We've got to stop this- Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from America. He has brought this all to our attention. Adoramus te, Christe. Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Church. If things continue this way, we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again!  Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught. It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong.. But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed! You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed. Cardinals, bishops and priests! Father Maxi has returned! And he has the Holy Document of-a Vatican Law!  Wait wait-a, the pope-a wants-a to say something.  The holy one!  O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your guidance. Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince her. Gone! It's all gone! Et dominus... In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys. What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi. Women? In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us. Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed! How did he make it past the water lizards? Great Queen Spider, we wish to change one of the Vatican rules. Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've killed our religion.  Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah! Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem.  The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?! Forget about the Gelgameks?!  The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex? Because we don't know where it is. HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattlesnakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths! And the uh immediate research shows that the act is not only amusing, but in fact much healthier for our bodies than the old way of eating.  You see, food entering through the anus has the benefit of being broken down on its way to the stomach rather than afterward. And therefore I believe that interorectogestion would actually put a stop to high cholesterol and most kinds of stomach cancers. And I base that on absolutely nothing. In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can easily be inserted into the ass is essential.    Beoo! What do you seek, Father? That Gospel...  But... many trials await thee inside! Only he whose heart truly belongs to the Lord shalla make it through. Then, prepare yourself. The time of trials begins.  Use all the strength, agility, and faith that you have. Hail Queen Spider! What do you ask of me? The Vatican rules cannot be changed. So saith the Spider. But the Holy Document of Vatican Law states that- Yeah, the pope is gone! Sorry, suckers!  Yeah.  Free hat! Free hat! Free hat! Free hat! Yeah! Yeah! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! YEAH! YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! YEAH! YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Awwww.  Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!! A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCullough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCullough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies? Well, Hat McCullough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free? Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as "positive" about toddler murder?  Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status? Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.  Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response? How so?  Hello, Ted. Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers. And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children. You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ever did.  Wait a minute. What'd you say? Yes. Change ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''! Why didn't we think of it before?! Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations! You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?!  Don't forget: you belong to me.  You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''! Your gay little club is over! Leave him!! Let him run back to his mommy!   The kid? The tweaked out kid?! Your pesistence surprises even me.     This is the birth of the NEW version of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration! Begin the film!  It's beyooootiful.   Oh hi, Ted. Hear hear. I'm not a Jew!  Eh, that's ''brilliant''! What are you doing?!  You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that!  We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!  ...What?? ALRIGHT, that does it!  Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED! It is... too late for me, boys. M-that's different. These are ''my'' movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them. Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?  Steven, Uh, I- Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was ''good''. I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys.  AaaaAAAAA!! STOP!  What are you doing, George?!  Don't even think about it, kid! I'm not afraid to use this walkie-talkie! The one with the cocaine-problem escaped, mein Direktor.  When we first made South Park, we didn't ''wanna'' use construction paper. We just ''had'' to because it was cheap. Expensive.   For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it. And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused.  Yeah. ''In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, the air is fresh and the people are free.'' No! He's right. We have to ''freeze'' his ''hot'' heart with a cool island song.  The mu-se-um tells us. Hey, get out of my way! Let's cool his hot temper with a ''fresh'' island song. Do me! That's it!  You knew Peter was dead! Let's go! Come on!  Amazing! Well, the print is finished and the day has come. Tonight, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas  will be at the premiere of the new special edition of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. Lots of celebrity guests and other rich people will be on hand to witness all the updated effects and modernized technology.  Surely you don't think you can escape from this premiere. And if we refuse? Hooray! All right!  Whoa.  Whoa. Ahhh. Ahh  Wow!!  Wow!!  Wow!!  Wait a minute. This version is awful! Yeah! They ruined it! Oh my God, it's terrible!  Today is a day of celebration, and we owe it all to these four brave young boys.  And thanks to the bravery of this young man in particular,  Yeah! Woohoohoo! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Yeah! Woohoohoo!  RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE! Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble... Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows!  Yeah! Woohoo! Yeah! Yeahah! Alright! Yeah. Right on! Right on! Hooray!! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!  Christmas Tree! YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!  Awww. Christmas songs! Christmas songs! Christmas songs!  Hurrah! Woohoo! Yay! Awwww! WOW!!!   Hooray! Thank you everyone-KILL! KILL THE INNOCENT!! Uh, I'm so thankful for all your support-RAPE THE VIRGINS!! And uh, I just wonder if i could get a baby real quick?   Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here. Please, mister, let me out. I miss my mom, mister. I wanna see my- Mister, please let me out of here. My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please! I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!   Bark bark bark bark! I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing?  Hey Bebe.  Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs! ...But I was like, "I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars."   Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.  Oh, for Christ's sake!  "The new Cold War." But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-  No! Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden. I heard that her asshole is like this big around.  Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut. Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut. Slut. What are you doing?! ''I'm'' class president! The vote was last fall! She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else!  Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid!  Yes! I want to get breast implants! That's what ''I'' said. I have three thousand dollars, cash.   Hey guys. You guys, uh,  Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.  Oh, uh, forty-eight? Yeah? Really?  I've never done that before. Well sure, that sounds hella fun. Cool. Okay. Uh. Listen guys, um, it's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later.  Hey everybody.  "My cat Thumper."  "Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."  Hey guys. ...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?  They called me a "slut with a huge gaping vagina". But am I slutty just because I'm starting to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool. Well if the girls don't wanna be my friends, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways. Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys. Precious?  It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Put the lotion in the basket! Don't you hurt my fucking dog! You guys, calm down! This is insane! Stop it you guys, please! Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble! I know. They've been there all day.  Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me? But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters. Mom?  What's six times eight?  Having boobs sucks. I wanna have breast-reduction surgery.  Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet. Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off? I think it's insane to want them bigger. Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life. Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want. No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero. Damnit! Oh, fuck off!   MOM!! MOM!!  My breasts! No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town! That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life! Hey guys.  Oh cool! It worked! Yes! Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment. Whoa. Yeah! You damn kids! You damn kids! 'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge. Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"? I can't stand her anymore! She's such a slut! I heard that she lifted her shirt to the boys at the bus stop.  Slut.  Slut.  Slut.  She's a total slut!  Slut.  Slut. You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.  Slut. Wwooww.  Whore. Slut. Slut. Bebe, is something the matter?  Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next. I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was ''really'' smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family. Oh, hello, boys. No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait. I believe she is playing "Lambs" over at Eric Cartman's house. Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out. Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers. Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman. Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart.  Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers.   What is it, Bebe?  Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady.  Uh huh. We're going to see our friend Bebe. Who is she with? Bebe!  Bebe is everybody's friend. Arf!   Right, but first we gotta go to the- Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives. Arf arf!  Aah. We made it. Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over! I don't want to live in this futuristic madness!  Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us?  I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?! Take your ape rule and go to hell!  Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today?  You? Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age. Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane. Why do you... hate your breasts so? Oh, come on now, that's just silly.   Now, I was saying? Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it? That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl. If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm? Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts? Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant. Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty. However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone.  I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go.  You pass. Let's do this thing. Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure.  What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water. Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?  Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great.  Here's the Anderson file, Doctor. What have we got?  And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor. Let the doctor do his work, ma'am.  The boys are at war. All is going as planned. We grow larger every day. Soon the entire tow-  Ah, quiet. Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees. And stronger. Sh! Sh! She's awake! I tried to tell her she was too young.  But she's eight!  Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now? I still don't know about this.  Tweek. Tweek? Come to the kitchen, sweetie. We need to see you real quick.  You know never to talk to strangers, right Tweek? You can't trust anybody. It's just a precaution, sweetie. Probably nothing will ever happen.  What if that had been a child abductor ''pretending'' to be a police officer, Tweek? 'Night, pumpkin.  Tweek, Tweek, are you okay? Uh... I'm just going to go upstairs and see if Tweek is still in his bed. It's okay. I can do it. That I don't abduct him? How do I know that you haven't done it already? That's not what the new study says! Could you help me across the street? Oh, hey, kid!  Oh, thank God you happened by. My- my chair ran out of juice right on these train tracks. If you hadn't had shown up, well... Well, anyway, could you give me a push? No, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm paralyzed from the neck down. I push the chair with this device in front of my mouth, but it's it's not working, so you see- Please, this, this isn't funny, kid. You have to help me. You have never seen the likes of me before. You have lost faith in humanity, lad. Something I cannot bear to see happen. That is the world of the news reports. It is the world that adults preoccupy themselves with, but it is not the world as it is. Look here, Tweek. This woman is on her way to the retirement home.  But do you hear about ''her'' on the news? No. Now gaze upon this humble house, Tweek. Inside there are two people who have adopted needy children.  They were strangers to those kids once. Now they are loving parents. Now, look here, boy.  Will their kindness be reported on the news tomorrow? I think not. Are you starting to understand, boy? That's right, lad. So do you think you can learn to trust people now? Good. Then why don't you get into the back of my van, and I'll drive you home.   Oh, I was so close! And I would have gotten away with it again if it weren't for you meddling policemen!  Alright Johnson, give it up! Then we aren't too late. His name is Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting children by dressing up like the Ghost of Human Kindness for over a year now. Oh my God, what are we gonna do? Oh. Hello everybody. What? But Tolkien's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to—Oh God!  Tolkien?  Jesus, what kind of porno was that? Oh, Jesus, not that one!   The report further states that it is because the child trusts the individual that problems occur in the first place. Sure does, Tom. In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago.  Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak. Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su-  We just wanna make sure nobody hurts you, Junior, m'kay?  Oh my God. Tah tane da ke ab kahleh kalabush.  De bandig baeakhalah? Mongolians?  Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's Candy Shop. Oh that's great! Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub. You know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket.  Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners? Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called "The Ticking Clock." Works great in the movies.  1 1 1 1 1 His body? Well, why?? Oh all right boys. Come on in.  Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny.  Your friends are here to see you, Kenny.  Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school!  Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school!  You see boys, Kenny is in here.  Wait a minute! This is kitty litter! Oh my God! This is awful!  And disgusting! Wewewewewewe... The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend.   Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder to heaven? Uh, meanwhile, the American economy cont-  wait. Wait. Wait a minute. We are getting reports now that Japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the US's. Let's go live to SNN correspondent Nobuhiro Sabasurisurijuwa. SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans believe in heaven, should we bomb it? The polls right now show that 51% of Americans think Saddam has to be dealt with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies.  Well when I see how this ladder has brought people together, how... how it has changed America, I mean, how can I not believe? My Harry died last year!  Mmm-hmm. The things did involve stuff, yes.  If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy, and the ladder is my penis...  I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States...  hard nipples! This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben.  ''Nahurabo Nahurabo'' Oh Jesus, no! Yeah. My sister told me he knew our mother's name and when she died.  ''Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven?'' ''Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?'' ''Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there? [walks up to the boys]'' You little bastards ruined my latest song!  We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys!  Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein. Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons. Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull. Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven! Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs. So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson! Yes sir! (We can watch it at my house.)  (Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!) (I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!) (Hey guys. What's goin' on?) (Oh, I've just been hanging out.) (Yeah.)}} Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese? Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago! Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop! That tricky bastard! Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction.  We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But ''he'' has ''not'' "re-spond-ed". Right. Dead, and in heaven. Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him around August.  Yes? I assure you, I am not high. Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.  And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs. That... kinda looks like a seagull.  War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!  We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves. Can I help you? You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars. It's gonna be okay, babe. Damnit! Damnit!  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD! This is preposterous! Even if there ''was'' a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there? Are you high, or just incredibly stupid? This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben.  Therefore, hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu. Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy.  Dude. Sir! Keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come on! Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This is a chocolate chip factory. See?  Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't make it ''look'' like a chemical weapons plant, would I? I'd make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something. }}  Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here. It looks like a chemical weapons plant. ...Alright, just checking.  ''[the video begins. Randy massages Sharon's arm] The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar.'' ''Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.'' ''Seven, to the races of Elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor. [Sharon takes a good look at the video]'' ''So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return ''The Lord of the Rings'' to the video store.'' ''The quest continued to return ''The Lord of the Rings'' to the video store.''   Well, well, well! If it isn't Robin Hood and his Merry Men! Whatcha got there? ''[looks at the case] Lord of the Rings''? Ha! That movie's gay!  Check it out, you guys!  No way! We're keepin' this and watchin' it ourselves! And what are three little fourth graders gonna do about it, huh?! Oh man, I can't wait to see this! Get 'em!   I smell fourth graders! Alright, everybody listen up! There's three snot-nosed little fourth graders out there who have a porno called ''Backdoor Sluts 9''. I checked it out on the Internet, and it said that ''Backdoor Sluts 9'' is ''the'' most hard-core porno ever made. I have amassed this army of sixth graders to get the tape by any means necessary. Now, let's go get that porno!  '''''Fourth graders! Give us that porn-o!'''''  What the hell is wrong with you guys?! Get the tape! Oh, god-damnit. Alright, come on. We'll find a bridge.   There they are!  Nooo!  You stupid little fourth graders! Yeah? Well, that's not gonna stop us from kicking your asses! Crap! Parents!  We'll see you next time, fourthies! Whoa!  Besides, if our bikes get wet, their chains'll rust. Aw man, now we'll never see the hot action. '''''Backdoor Sluts 9?!?''''' Ooooooh! Ahhhhh! Ahhh. I'll go. Ringworms are no match for a dwarf. Me too.   Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter? Tolkien!  Tolkien? Did the boys come over and... show you a movie?  I shall put a magic spell on you! I have blocked your spell, wizard! We're playing Harry Potter. Dude, I don't wanna get wet. Yeah, I don't really like the water.  Don't let them turn it back into the video store! Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade. I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you. As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job. We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that. I know you will.   It's for real, Mr. Garrison. With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars. Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.  Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.  Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please? Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat. Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods. No no no we're not firing you. No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar. You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class? I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef. No, no, I think I have a better idea. I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.  Hi kids. Hm.  Oh Jesus Christ. Ugh.  Oh Jesus Christ.  Oh-oh. Oh it hurts. AAH. AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!  Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass. Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  How'd it go? The principal didn't fire you? Oh, Jesus Christ. Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What ''you'' need to do is let the ''parents'' see what kind of demented faggot you are. Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.   Uh-huc, Jesus Christ. Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess. Eugh, Jesus Christ.  Yes, Mr. Garrison? Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole? I've got a little- Oof.  Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there? Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass!  Yeah, Jesus Christ. Oooo, this could be kind of fun.  Yeah.    Now ''you'' know how it feels.  That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids? That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like "All Asians are good at math" is harmful to society.  Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.  like this young man here. You other boys have probably called this young man names like "tubby," or "lardbutt," or "fat tits,"... But you ''must'' learn to be tolerant of ''his'' differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice. And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies. Well, that's the end of our tour. We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do.  There's no smoking in the museum! Get out of here, you filthy smoker!  Well, have a great day, everybody. Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award.  Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students. It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison.   Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy.  Oh I was just uh- But I'm not in the museum. Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die.   Hang on, Lemmiwinks! You solved the Catatafish's riddle. Now your trials are nearly through!   Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated. Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint!  What are you fingerpainting?! Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!  Faasterr. Faster! Are you done?! What is it?! What have you done?!  GOOD!  Faasterr! Everything in order?  Take this one away. He is done for.   I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my spirit been trapped within this place. Before you lies the maze of the small intestine. One path leads to the stomach, the other to certain doom. Take with you this helmet and torch.  Thanks to you we are all free. You chose your path wisely, Lemmiwinks. I am the Catatafish. If you answer this riddle, the esophagus will let you pass. Great job, Lemmiwinks. ''Catatafish of the stomach's cove.'' ''Catatafish's riddle will soon be told.'' Yes, mein Führer. Ve are making the prisoners make macaroni pictures that illustrate diversity in the verkplace.  Waht?! Vhat is in there? Get back to verk. Please don't tell them that we're hiding here. We can't work anymore or we'll die. Eww! Eww! Eww!  All hail the Gerbil King.   Not sure. It looks like a possible code five six! Welcome aboard Flight 673 to New York. We are happy to show you a feature film during the flight. In a moment we'll be showing a preview. Okay audience members, hi, welcome to the taping of the show.  It's all general seating in there, and just remember, Mr. Edward might not hear from the particular dead person you wanna talk to, so just... keep an open mind. Thank you, thank you. Alright let's get started.  I'm getting um, I'm getting M-mike? Definitely an M, d'um, maybe Matt? Mike? Matt? Mi-mmm, Mi-Mike, m-Mary? Okay okay, and she-she's she died? Okay, and she's telling me there's something about... the money. That the, the money is safe? Is that making sense?  Must be from somewhere else in the audience, then. Uh, d'uh, money? Is someone el- Uh d'eh'hm quiet, quiet down boys. It doesn't work that way. Uh, okay, I I'm getting ...someone now whose name is g-, a t-. It's an l-, it's a m-, it's k-. Kenny says hi. Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died? And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a ''sad'' death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?  Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place. Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle? Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma? She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves. Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-? Oh, it's comin' from over here.  Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things. And that those things involved... stuff? Thank you, thank you. Oh.  Maybe it ''is'' for real. Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head. Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life. But I'm a psychic. I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me? I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police! I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche!  So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?! They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll ''sue'' you for slander! Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does ''that'' make ''me'' a douche?! I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not! I'm not a douche!  Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give me your best shot! Wah-why? But I ''do'' have a special power! I know I do! God-damnit, I'm special!!  Why that... that's me!  What?! No, wait! I'm not a douche! I make people feel good about themselves!  I'm not a douche!  Wow!  wow...  Oh, wow, that's incredible! Wow! Yes. Right. Yeah.  He doesn't do private readings. Alright, come on in.  Just wait here. I'll go fetch him.   Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward.  Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip to Edinburgh should take about twelve hours. In the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film. I'm a carrot! Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh!  John Edward? Oh yeah, I heard he walked up to a guy on the street, and said his dead father wanted to say "Happy Birthday," and it WAS his birthday. You have to tell me if my sister's in a good place.  Yeah kid, how do you explain that? That's amazing. Can you try to reach my grandfather. Oh-ho. Me?  Okay. My father?  My birthday's in November! Oh my God.  What else does he say?  Oh my God! My sister and I have been fighting over his inheritance. Kid, how would you like your own talking to the dead show? Oh, my baby come home! Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine. So nice to have you here, Liane. Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in the oven, too.   Come out now. Come out now. You all come out of ''there'' now. Come on out, spirit. Go! Oooo, that's the potatoes.  Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child. We weren't gonna ask you where you got it from.  Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains. I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas. Here, spirit, come out the window.  I'm just tryin' to persuade it.  Don't let it get in the roast!    This child is clean.   Yes, yes! Yes, my husband Peter!  Yes, it was. Oh wow! Ask Peter if he knows my little Billy. What the? Aaaah!   We seek the great John Edward. Sir, it is an honor to meet you.  I am Quagmar, and this is the Intergalactic BDIU Committee. Mr. Edward, it is my honor to inform you that you have been nominated for Biggest Douche In the Universe!  If you step into our plabpa feed, we'll give you a first-class ride to the awards show.   You are the first nominee from the Milky Way Galaxy.  Congratulations! Well I don't know. How did Edward know my father died in March? This year's nominees are... Damanta Unit 5, J-Lax Galaxy, Planet Neeu.  And finally, Ursula, the giant douche  from the Horsehead Nebula, Station J-12.  John Edward, Milky Way Galaxy, Planet Earth.  And the winner for Biggest Douche In the Universe is...  It's John Edward, Milky Way Galaxy, Planet Earth! Derrr.  <poem><i>Here he is, the Biggest Douche of the Universe!</i></poem> You kids fucking don't fuck around with your fucking mom! Dad, we fucking can't! It's a big flick a fuck! Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.  Oh, whoa man, it's you! It's me, Mom, your son Stan.  Dad! No way, it's me from the past!   Oh man, this is so messed up. Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist, and you don't like chicken. Mom, your maiden name is Kimble and you have a scar on your left knee from when you slipped in the swimming pool. Dude, just let me talk to you for like, five minutes. After that I'll bail. I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out. I have no idea, man. I was just about to go asleep in an alley behind the crackhouse,  and I shot up a little heroin, and then this electrical storm started. Next thing I knew I was running around in my own past, man. I thought... I was just tripping, but then I came down and I was still here. Oh, dude, it's so bizarre! Thanks. Can I get another beer? That'd be killer. Where can I crash? Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys. Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol.  Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006. Yes, former self? Oh, uh... Sure uh, uh,  Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up-  Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek? Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me! My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific.  Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always. We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs. Heh it sure should, heh. Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well? Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son. Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son. Alright, so we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News. Motivation Corp. takes care of everything.  Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives. So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding. Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking. So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism.  Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means. Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh! My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin. Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs.  "Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future." Oh this is going to be fun. ¿Qué? ¿La caca no esta aquí?  ¡Sí, sí señor!  Sí. Marrado.  Sí.   Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice. Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future.  I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company! Right on! No, wait!  Oh, God-damnit!}} Ah-a-a-alright, I'm done. Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice. It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good. A-a-aactually it looks like this year you're gonna ''owe'' Santa three hundred and six presents. Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad. Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice. Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you. Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers! But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here? Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth. If you cured cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents. Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever.  Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'? Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus! Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away! Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic.  All aboard the Poo Choo Express! Next stop, the North Pole! Let's go, Poo Choo Train!  ''Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a'' ''All the way and back!'' ''Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.''  Here we are, kids. The North Pole.  That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude.  We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business. Howdy ho, Santa! All ready for Christmas? Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric. All right! Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad.  It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them. Santa! Are you alright? Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody. Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time! We should be able to find Jesus in no time! Hooowdy ho!  Do you know a way? Howdy ho, Jesus.  More soldiers are coming! Start the sleigh! What are you doin', Santa? Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now! I'll help you, Santa! Poo Choo!  Poo Choo! Mr. Hankey! Sure thing! Ten months out of the year. But this time of year we help Santa!  This is Santa's flight control center. From here, we can monitor Santa from satellite as he travels the globe delivering presents. Sleigh is hit! I repeat! Sleigh is hit!  Sleigh is going down! I repeat! Sleigh is going down!   Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!  Mr. Hankey, how are you? I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me. Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end. You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation. Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run! And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room. Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!  Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all! Merry Christmas!  Hold on!   North Pole. This is Santa.  Where are you taking me??   To bring happiness and joy to the children. No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?! I don't know, I live in the North Pole.  What are you doing?? Oh no. Not Santa's balls!   I'm gonna fucking kill you! Then we're in for a long night, because I don't know shit!  Jesus Christ!  Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus!  Santa's legs are broken.  I just couldn't do it.   No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch. We sure did, Jesus.  I'm here, Jesus.  Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh!  You're right, kid.  I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it!  Hohoho! Merry Christmas!  Merry Christmas! Hohoho! Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!   Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day, we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus. Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do.    Paka klakalaka.  Anah kakadakadaka. Ultimate failure at o-sixhundred feet!  What is your status? Follow me. You can take Santa's backup sleigh.  We fed Jesus Christ's data into the autopilot. This sleigh should be able to take you right to him. Here it is. Red Sleigh 2.  You just have to call out the reindeer's names. No, no, they're all dead. You have to call out the new ones.    Jesus Christ, they killed him! What the hell are ''we'' supposed to do?! We're like nine inches tall!  Why you come to Iraq, my main man? And this is...?  America wants to bomb ''my'' house, my main man. They want to kill my wife and children. We need to know... what is their plan? They say that the Chinese were the first to experiment with an electroshock to the testicles. What else is America planning?! You're not in a position to kill anyone, my main man! I just want you to tell me America's plan! You're a sick capitalist dog, my main man!  Drink it! Drink the oil! This is all you Western capitalists want!  Ach!   Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children? Santa? Is he alright? We have to get him out of there. Yes. Yes, I think I do.  Lock and load! We're goin' in! He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.  Wait here, I can handle this. Yay, look upon me, and know me. My children, you should know something.  Here.  Can you walk? They are healed.  Santa... Let's move. Move!  You're a... bad liar.  Hey. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh? Uh Santa? Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit.   Red Sleigh 2, come in. You're coming up on the source of the signal. You're right on top of him!  Gankueda! Halak balah!  Kinkeda? Kinkakueda! Kli malah!  Dakadaka!
