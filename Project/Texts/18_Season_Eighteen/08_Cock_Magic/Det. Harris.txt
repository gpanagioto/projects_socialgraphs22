Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us? Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it. Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held? Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong, and anyone I find involved with this filth is goin' down! Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that?  Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using? Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report? Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?! Agreed! Who first called 911?  Freeze!  Especially you, scumbag! We saw your fliers.  "Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm." I'll volunteer. I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.
