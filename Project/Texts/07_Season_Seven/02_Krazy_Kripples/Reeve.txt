Though it is controversial,  the disabled. In the coming days  that stem-cell research is a miracle. Thanks for having me on again, Larry. Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet. Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement.  Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again. Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you? I am better with each passing day.   What? And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?  Chris!  Hello, Gene! So good to see you! Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?! Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha! I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.  Hack Man! No...  NOOOO! You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!
