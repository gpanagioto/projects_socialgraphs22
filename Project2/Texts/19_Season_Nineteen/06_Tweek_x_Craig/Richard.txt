Tweek's out of coffee, honey. Tweek, is there anything you want to talk to us about?  Well, we heard that you're gay. And I want you to know we've never been so proud of you. We thought you were just a spaz, but to know that you've got so much going on inside. Knowing what I know now, I'm gonna be a much better dad to you. In fact, I just, I just want to give you some money, Tweek.  Well, hello Craig. Honey, it's Craig. He sure is. Come on in.  Would you like to have some coffee, Craig? Tweek's just up in his room playing. You can go on up.  They're so gay.
