 Hey Kelly. How's it going? Hey there! How are you? Good times, good times! Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion. Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two? Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun!  Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret? Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them? Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it.  Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you? Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test. Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid. Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable ''and'' totally depressed. Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again. It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.  Yep- Oh hey there, Greg! Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg. Mike, I need to talk to you!  Take a look at this. The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters! Oh! We are gonna ''sue'' you!
