Oh hi Gerald, Sheila. Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV. Don't our men look  Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures. And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever. You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great. Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?! This is crazy!  That does it! I can't take it anymore! Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do!  There they are! Get 'em! We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.
