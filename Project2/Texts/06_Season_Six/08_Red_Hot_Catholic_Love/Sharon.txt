I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on. That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids, anything fun happen with your whole Sunday off? Stanley!   I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some. And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here.  Oh, Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
