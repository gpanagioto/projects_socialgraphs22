 Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry? ...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly- And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion? ...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible- ...Woo-hat? ...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.  Kenny Kenny, calm down. Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!  Kenny? No! No! Uh-what? Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember? Dude, where the fuck are we? Oh shit! We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here. How, dude? Oh my God! Kenny! Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mintberry Crunch. Ya got poop, don't ya? Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool? Oh my God! Holy shit dude!
