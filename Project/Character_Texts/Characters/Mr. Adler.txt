You are here because you are America's future!  shop class. Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...  Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?

Everything is going to be awesome now! 
Amazing book, Butters.  
Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete. What ''can'' we do? We're all gonna get fired! Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them. Our students committing suicide? How do we do that? 
Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked. Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am. This way.

It's truly incredible for all of us. With this new surge of people from urban areas, we're seeing more town money from sales taxes, more profit in our local businessesâ€“ Uh...how so? I thought city people were good for our economy. Well, it serves you right for what you're doing to our town!
