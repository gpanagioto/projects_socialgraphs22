 I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go. Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys.  Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late.  Oh, God. That was boring. Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there. Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation. Why would we look at a newspaper, retard? Really?  Yes! What's it say, what's it say? What? Let me see that.  Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that? You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog.  I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys. How is this Kyle? This good?   Cool, these will be good uploads. Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here? Why don't you make me?  Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  Bad Mr. Kitty! I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting. Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her. Dude, what's going on? Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?  Come on, Kyle. It's okay, man, come on. Get a couple facing the other way, brah.  I know. I know Kyle.  I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  No, no. It was kind of stupid, really. And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff.   Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good? No, kitty, you have to be quiet. No kitty! That's a bad kitty!   Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous! Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time. SHUT UP, KITTY! Let's do this.   <poem><i>We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.</i></poem>
