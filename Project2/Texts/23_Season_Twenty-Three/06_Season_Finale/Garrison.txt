What? ...Who? ...Oh okay, sure, put him through. This is the President. Huho, tell me about it. Well, did you tell everyone you didn't do anything wrong? Well, did you then go on the attack and swap the accusations to make yourself a victim? Oh Jeez, DARVO, Randy. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. Alright, let's role-play. You be your accusers and I be you. Okay, go. "No I didn't! Are you joking, you psychopath?! Now you're blowin' up my yard!" Go ahead, try another one. "You damage property to make your business more profitable, you lying sack of shit! I'm not gonna be bullied by you!" See?  It's really not that hard, just takes a little chin wiggle. Do I know any good lawyers? No, but I do know Rudy Giuliani.  The fuck you, Rudy. Are you finished cleaning up those pistachio nuts yet? Listen, Randy, I'm gonna throw you a bone. You just sit tight and I'll have him take care of this.
