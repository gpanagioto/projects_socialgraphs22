Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for your abortion?  Well, try to relax; It will all be over very soon.   Now, there is one more thing. Have you heard of stem-cell research? Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses-  ah- I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies. The hope is that someday it might.  Great.  Nurse?  This is to go to Alder's Labs for stem-cell research.  There we go, little buddy. You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm. Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny.
