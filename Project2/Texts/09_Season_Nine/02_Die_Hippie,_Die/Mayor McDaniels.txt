All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B. Kid, we're have a city council meeting. Kid, what the hell are you talking about? Johnson, get him out of here.  I know. I signed the permit. I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little "festival" should pump some money into our economy. They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want! That kid really needs some psychiatric help. All right, let's go. What have I done?  They still have a long way to go! What's happened? That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
