+++++


Bus Stop.

Kyle

Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice.

+++++


A dog walks up to the boys.

Stan

Hiya, Sparky.

Kyle

[Looking] Who's that?

Stan

That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.

Kyle

Wow! Cool!

Stan

Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?

Cartman

Eh. You're making me sick, dude.

Stan

He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.

Cartman

No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.

Sylvester

Arrrrrr.

Stan

He's not meaner than Sparky.

Cartman

Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!

+++++


Sylvester comes over.

Stan

Sparky'll kick his ass.

Cartman

I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.

Kyle

You're on, dude!

+++++


Sylvester starts after Sparky. Both dogs growl.

Stan

That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!

+++++


Sparky lunges after Sylvester and out of view. Aggressive panting can be heard. The boys stand there, shocked.

Cartman

Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.

Stan

Sparky! Bad dog!

Kenny

(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)

Stan

What?!

Cartman

Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.

Stan

What do you mean?

Cartman

That dog is a gay homosexual.

+++++


Stan looks back to study the situation, then...

Stan

He's just confused.

Kyle

I think the other dog's the one that's confused.

Kenny

(No, check his penis.)

+++++


Kyle smiles.

Stan

Sick, shut up dude!

+++++


Sparky pants happily while Sylvester slinks away.

Cartman


Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.



+++++


The bus pulls up.

+++++


Football Field, sideline before school.

Chef

Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park.

Kyle

Who's Middle Park?

Cartman

What's homecoming?

Chef

But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. [silence] Now, let's start practice.

+++++


Chef blows his whistle, and the kids hit the field.

Pip

Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?

Chef

Yes Pip, what is it?

Pip

Uh, I still don't have a helmet.

Chef

I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.

Pip

Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?

Chef

Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does.

Pip

Oh.

Chef

Sorry son, now get your ass in there.

+++++


Out on the playing field.

Stan

Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.

Chef

[impatiently] Hike the damn ball!

+++++


Cartman hikes the ball over Stan's head. Stan chases it down. Kyle runs into Pip, opening a major gash on Pip's head.

Pip

Aaaaaaaargh!

+++++


Jimbo and Ned arrive.

Jimbo

Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?

Chef

[distracted] Huh? Oh, fine, fine.

Jimbo

I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.

Chef

Elementary school alumni?

Jimbo

That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?

Chef

I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?

Jimbo

Middle Park by 70 points.

Chef

Hmmm...

+++++


They look towards the field, where Kenny tackles Cartman, causing him to drop the ball.

Chef

I don't think we have a chance.

Jimbo

Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. [yells] Right Stanley?

+++++


Stan turns to see his uncle just as Cartman hikes.

Stan

Huh?

+++++


The ball hits him on the side of the head. He picks it up and throws to Kyle.

Jimbo

Atta boy!

Chef

Great pass, Stan!

Jimbo

Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!

+++++


On sideline after practice.

Chef

Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.

Kyle

Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?

Stan

Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.

Clyde

Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.

Stan

Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down!

Clyde

Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!

Cartman

There he goes again.

Stan

Get down, Sparky! Down!

Cartman

Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.

Clyde

Make him stop!

+++++


Rex moves away with his tail between his legs.

Rex

Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!

+++++


Fosse and Bill pass by laughing.

Fosse

I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.

Bill

Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.

Fosse

Gay dog.

+++++


The bullies walk away laughing, while Sparky walks up panting.

+++++


Mr. Garrison's classroom. Start of school.

Cartman

...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.

Mr. Garrison

Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-.

Cartman

Ah, dammit!

Mr. Garrison

Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?

Mr. Hat

Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?

Mr. Garrison

Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next.

Stan

Um, I'm not really prepared either.

Mr. Garrison

Well, just make something up, like Eric did.

Stan

Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-

Mr. Garrison

Excellent. A-.

Cartman

Eeyy!

Stan

Wow, cool!

Cartman

Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?

Mr. Garrison

Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people.

Cartman

That's not fair!

Mr. Hat

Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it.

Cartman

Stupid puppet.

+++++


Dismissal bell rings.

Mr. Garrison

Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.

+++++


All students except Stan leave the room.

Stan

Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?

Mr. Garrison

Well of course Stanley, what is it?

Stan

What's a... homosexual?

Mr. Garrison

Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.

+++++


Stan sits.

Mr. Garrison

Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold, black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?

Stan

I guess.

Mr. Garrison

Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.

+++++


Bus stop. The boys get off the bus.

Cartman

You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.

Kyle

You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.

Cartman

Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.

Stan

Shut up, dude!

+++++


Sparky comes up panting with a pink scarf on.

Stan

Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?

Sparky

Bark, bark.

Cartman

Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen.

Stan

He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky.

+++++


Sparky sits.

Stan

Good boy, now shake.

+++++


Sparky shakes.

Stan

Good boy. Now, don't be gay.

+++++


Stan waits for the command to sink in.

Stan

Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay.

+++++


Sparky looks at Stan with confusion and growls.

Kyle

Did it work?

Stan

I don't know.

Cartman

He still looks pretty gay to me.

Bill

Huh, huh.

Fosse

Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?

Bill

Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbra Streisand concert. [they laugh] Stupid little gay dog.

Fosse

Gay dog.

Stan

Come on you guys, I have an idea.

+++++


Sports Book, Ned and Jimbo enter. Two big-screen monitors show horse races. One of the five smaller screens above show a race as well.

Jimbo

I want $500 on the South Park Cows.

Bookie

Are you crazy?

Jimbo

No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.

Gambler 1

I want to put all my money on the Cows.

Gambler 2

Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it.

Gambler 3

Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too.

Female Gambler 1

I got 500 on the Cows.

Female Gambler 2

Well, I'll put my money on the Cows.

Jimbo

Whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now uh...

Gambler 4

You better be right about this, Jimbo.

Jimbo

Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself.

Ned

Are you sure Stan is that good?

Jimbo

Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?

Bookie

You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.

Ned

I love that song.

Jimbo

'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.

+++++


In front of Stan's house, a large crate sits next to the kids.

Stan

Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-

+++++


Stan notices a pink scarf on Sparky.

Stan

Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!

+++++


He grabs the scarf.

Stan

No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi.

+++++


The crate opens and Fifi, a French poodle, comes out.

Kyle

Ooh-la-la.

+++++


Fifi sniffs some. Sparky starts following her.

Cartman

There he goes!

Stan

Atta boy, Spark! Get her!

+++++


Sparky climbs atop Fifi.

Stan

Yes!

+++++


Sparky pulls Fifi's collar off and into the air, catching it around his neck.

Stan

Ah crap! Now what do I do?

Kyle

Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.

Cartman

No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France.

Kenny

(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)

Stan

I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.

Kyle

Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.

Stan

Like who?

+++++


Inside Stan's house, Jesus and Pals' title screen is on TV.

TV Announcer

And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.

Jesus Christ

Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]

Robert

Yeah, is- is this Jesus?

Jesus

Yes my son.

Robert

This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife.

Jesus

Of course Robert. How are things now?

Robert

Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins too, that was really nice of you.

Jesus

Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]

Stan

Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.

Jesus

My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-

+++++


The station's logo pops up.

TV Announcer

That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews.

Stan

Damn it!

Kyle

What'd he say?

Stan

I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.

Cartman

Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!

Stan

Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?

Kyle

Come on dude, we have to get to practice.

Stan

No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!

+++++


Outside, Sparky overhears this.

Stan

I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!

+++++


Sparky grouses, digs a hole, and makes his way out of the yard. He wanders into the mountains, looks back once more, and is gone.

+++++


On the sideline at practice.

Chef

Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. [Music starts.] Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! [Sinks into the mood.]

Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.



Kyle

Uh, Chef?

Chef


Spank it, ever so gently.



Kyle

Chef.

Chef


Spank it.



Kyle

Chef!

Chef

Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.

Pip

Uh, Mr. Chef sir?

Chef

No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.

Pip

Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?

Chef

That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?

Pip

No um, I guess not.

+++++


Carl's Bombs And Explosives and Accessories.

Jimbo

What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.

Carl

What moment would that be?

Jimbo

Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.

Carl

What high F?

Jimbo

You know, 
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah.



Carl

Right, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?

Jimbo

No, dammit! The aaaaah!

Carl

Aaaaahh?

Ned

Aaaaahh.

Jimbo

Aaaaahh!

Carl

Aaaaahh.

Jimbo

Great.

Carl

Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah.

Ned

Doo-nn-doo-doo

Jimbo

You got it.

Carl

Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...

Ned

Aaa - dooo...

Jimbo

Aaaaahh!

Carl

Alright, yeah, okay...

+++++


On the sideline at practice.

Chef

What's the matter, Stan? You seem down.

Stan

I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.

Chef

Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.

+++++


Coming up to see what's the matter.

Mr. Garrison

Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.

Chef

Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.

Mr. Garrison

What do you mean?

Chef

Well, you're gay aren't you?

Mr. Garrison

What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.

Chef

Well, you sure do act like it.

Mr. Garrison

I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass.

+++++


Chef looks puzzled, wondering.

+++++


On the field.

+++++


Kyle runs up from behind.

Kyle

What's the matter dude?

Stan

I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.

Cartman

Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!

+++++


Snowy mountains. Sparky is trekking through the snow, stops, and looks around. A floating castle nears him. It's Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.

Big Gay Al

Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al.

+++++


Sparky looks at him.

Big Gay Al

Have you been outcast?

+++++


Sparky pants an affirmative.

Big Gay Al

Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?

+++++


Sparky pants an affirmative.

Big Gay Al

Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here.

+++++


Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman are at the Bus Stop. Stan walks up.

Stan

Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.

Kyle

Wow, it's been like two days.

Stan

I think he might've run away.

Cartman

Did you check the shopping ma- [Stan punches him] Ow!

Kyle

We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan.

Stan

I'm not playing.

Kyle

You what?!

Stan

I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. [leaves]

+++++


Middle Park Elementary School.

Jimbo

[whispering] Come on Ned, and keep quiet.

Ned

[louder] Okay.

+++++


They climb over the fence and approach the Middle Park mascot, a horse.

Jimbo

Hello there, Enrique.

Ned

What are we doing here?

Jimbo

Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead.

+++++


Jimbo puts the bomb on Enrique's back.

Jimbo

And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in "Loving You", BOOM!

+++++


Enrique gets wide-eyed.

Jimbo

No more Middle Park players!

+++++


Jimbo and Ned laugh, and Enrique starts to tremble.

Jimbo

God damn, I love football!

+++++


Stan is in the stormy mountains.

Stan

Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?

+++++


South Park Elementary.

+++++


The Middle Park Cowboys exit the bus.

Cowboys

Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!

+++++


South Park Football Field. The bleachers are filled with fans decked out in COWS! gear. Even Ike is wearing a GO COWS shirt and bouncing about.

Frank Hammond

Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows.

+++++


Pounds the table, and Phil's mike falls over. He scans the sidelines.

Frank

Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up.

Chef

[between his teeth] Oohh, come on, Stan...

Pip

Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?

Chef

No Pip, I'm sorry!

+++++


Stormy mountains.

Stan

Sparky! Sparky!

+++++


South Park Football Field, first quarter. The game is about to begin.

Referee

Play ball.

Chef

You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.

Kyle

But I never practiced quarterback.

Chef

Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.

Frank

Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski.

Mr. Garrison

Hey hey, where is little Stanley?

Mr. Hat

Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?

Jimbo

Ned, look!

+++++


Middle Park's mascot, Enrique, is shown.

Jimbo

They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.

Ned

Yay.

+++++


Stan follows his dog's footprints and finds himself facing Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.

Big Gay Al

Hi little fella, how are you doing today?

Stan

Fine, how are you?

Big Gay Al

I'm super, thanks for asking.

Stan

My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.

Big Gay Al

Well, let's see. Come on in. [they enter]

Stan

Do you have lots of gay dogs here?

Big Gay Al

We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.

Gay Lion

Rooaar.

Big Gay Al

And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!

Stan

Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.

Big Gay Al

Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?

+++++


They enter the techno-dance floor as disco music plays. Animals pour in to dance, even a dolphin on its tail.

Vocalist


Oww, we can both be gay!



+++++


In the huddle. The Cows win the coin toss.

Kyle

Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!

Huddle

Break!

+++++


At the line of scrimmage.

Cowboy 1

You guys are toast.

Cowboy 2

Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in.

Cartman

We'll just see about that.

Kyle

Set, set.

+++++


Cartman farts long and nasty right into Kyle's face. Kyle quickly retreats.

Kyle

Damn it Cartman!

Chef

What's the matter?

Kyle

Cartman farted!

Cartman

No I didn't. That was just my shoes.

Chef

Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.

Kyle

No way dude!

Chef

Hike! The! Ball!

+++++


Kyle is back in position, with his shirt covering his nose.

Kyle

Ah, dude, weak.

Cartman

That's right, you get back there.

Kyle

Hike!

Frank

Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!

+++++


Screaming as Kyle is tackled.

Frank

Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter.

Jimbo

Hell's bells.

Frank

Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King.

+++++


Phil quickly covers the mic.

Phil

Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again.

Frank

Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that.

Townsman 1

We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo.

Jimbo

Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh.

+++++


Big Gay Al's Big Gay Dance Floor.

Vocalist


...both be gay.



+++++


Stan is dancing with a monkey, then sees Sparky.

Stan

Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?

Sparky

Ruff.

Stan

I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.

Sparky

Barr.

Stan

Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.

+++++


Sparky follows Stan.

Stan

We can work on making you not gay together.

+++++


Sparky stops and sits.

Stan

Sparky?

Big Gay Al

Young man, it appears you still don't understand.

Stan

What don't I understand?

Big Gay Al

Come this way, I have to show you something.

+++++


South Park Football Field, second quarter.

Frank

With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0.

Kyle

Hut, hut.

+++++


Cartman snaps the ball to Kyle. The Cowboys blitz. Kyle flips the ball back to Pip, who is still without a helmet. The Cowboys players descend on him as soon as he catches the ball.

Frank

Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant.

+++++


Phil muffles Frank.

Phil

Dude! Now that is not cool.

Frank

Sorry, sorry.

+++++


Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.

Big Gay Al

Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride.

+++++


Stan looks at the boat.

Big Gay Al

Step aboard, Stanley.

+++++


He and Sparky step aboard the boat.

Big Gay Al

Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time.

+++++


South Park Football Field. South Park's final drive before the halftime show.

Frank

And the South Park Cows are set to receive...

+++++


The Cowboys kick off.

Frank

There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick.

+++++


Kenny weaves through the special teams.

Frank

He's at the 50, the 40, the 30.

Cowboys

Hold him, hold him!

+++++


Two of them take hold of Kenny's arms.

Cowboys

Hold him, hold him!

Cowboy

Yaaah!

+++++


A Third Cowboy dives in, taking Kenny's head off, as the other two sever Kenny's arms.

Frank

The little running back is down. I think he's...

+++++


Rats come in to devour Kenny's corpse.

Frank

Yes, he's been decapitated.

Kyle

[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!

Phil

Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank.

Frank

Ouch-a-roo!

Chef

Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!

Frank

Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot.

+++++


Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.

+++++


The boat-ride begins the passage through several animatronic scenes.

Big Gay Al

You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan.

+++++


The tips of the Japanese soldiers' swords touch.

Big Gay Al

Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!

+++++


Big Gay Al fires off a shot with his pistol.

Big Gay Al

Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely.

+++++


Doors open to reveal a scene reminiscent of 'It's a Small World'.

Boat Ride Singers


We're all gay, and it's okay,
'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.
We're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.
It's okay, hey, to be gay!



Big Gay Al

Sooo, what do you think, Stan?

+++++


Still singing.
...It's okay to be gay...



Stan

This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand.

+++++


Still singing.
It's okay to be gay. Shalala waylaylay shalala waylaylay. It's okay to be gay.



Big Gay Al

[to himself] Isn't this precious?

+++++


South Park Football Field. Halftime.

Frank

And now, here to sing the touching song Loving You, is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother...

Audience Member

Alright Richard!

+++++


Music starts up.

Richard Stamos


Loving you,
is easy cause you're beautiful,
-doo-n-doo-n-doo-doooo-
Aaaaah!



+++++


His voice cracks and the music stops.

Richard


Aaaaah!



Jimbo

What the hell?!

Richard


Aaaaah!



+++++


His voice wavers.

Jimbo

He didn't sing the high F!

Mr. Garrison

Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.

Jimbo

Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.

Richard


Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...



Mr. Garrison

[heckling] It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!

+++++


Outside of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.

Stan

Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!

Sparky

Ruff!

Big Gay Al

No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?

Stan

No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!

+++++


They start to walk off.

Big Gay Al

Oh Stan?

+++++


They stop.

Big Gay Al

When you get back to town, [earnest music plays] tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately.

Stan

I will Big Gay Al, I will.

+++++


They depart.

+++++


Bell dings.

Big Gay Al

Ooh, my carrot cake! [rushes inside]

+++++


South Park Football Field, fourth quarter.

Kyle

Hike!

Frank

And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...

Mr. Garrison

I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo.

Mr. Hat

Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.

Townsman

You're a dead man, Jimbo!

+++++


A hail of food products is thrown at Jimbo.

Frank

Well, this should just about wrap it up for-

+++++


Stan and Sparky come onto the field.

Frank

Wait a minute, what's this?

Jimbo

Yeah! Yohooooh!

Frank

It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback!

Chef

Where the hell have you been Stan?!

Stan

I've been getting my best friend back.

Chef

Just get in there boy!

Jimbo

Give 'em hell, Stanley!

+++++


Stan takes his place on the field as Jimbo looks to the heavens, and prays aloud to himself.

Jimbo

Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?

+++++


In the first row of the stands.

Jesus

Leave me alone.

Stan

Hike!

Frank

Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.

Kyle

Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!

Stan

Mph!

+++++


Stan throws the ball.

Frank

And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!

Kyle

Oof.

+++++


Kyle runs towards the end zone, panting, Cowboys hot on his trail.

Frank

Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!

+++++


Frank recoils.

Phil

Dude!

+++++


The crowd cheers as Kyle scores.

Frank

Touchdown!

Jimbo

Yeah! Wooo!

Frank

The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!

+++++


Frank swats his mic away.

Jimbo

Yeah! Woohoo!

+++++


Postgame press conference. Stan gets on stage by scoreboard.

Townsman

Speech!

Frank

Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?

Stan

Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.

Crowd

Yeah, alright!

Stan

And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!

Crowd

Wooooh!

Stan

And it's okay to be gay!

+++++


The crowd falls silent.

Jimbo

What?!

Stan

Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.

Mr. Garrison

What the hell is he talking about?

Frank

Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?

Stan

I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.

+++++


The crowd looks at Stan in disbelief.

Stan

It's true, I'll show you.

+++++


At the site of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. There is nothing to be seen.

Stan

But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...

Cartman

Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.

+++++


The missing animals suddenly appear.

Townswoman

Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago!

Townsperson 1

Sidney!

Townsperson 2

Willy!

Townsperson 3

Carlos!

+++++


Big Gay Al is suddenly at Stan's side.

Big Gay Al

I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.

Stan

Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?

Big Gay Al

I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done.

+++++


He pops his suitcase open and climbs into it.

Big Gay Al

Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you.

+++++


He presses a button, and the suitcase closes.

Stan

Wow!

+++++


The suitcase flies off.

Richard

You guys, you guys! I can do it.

Mr. Garrison

Do what?

Richard


Loving you,
Is easy cause you're beautiful,
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo



Jimbo

No!

Richard


Aaah!



Enrique

Mroo-

+++++


BOOM!
