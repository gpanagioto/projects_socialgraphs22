That's real pain right there.  She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks. I don't know.  She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.  I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child. Yes. They called her an emo. Emos suck! They're vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes! Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference! Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an ''emo'' thinks that deep down, ''they'' are totally fucked up. Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide. But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people ''commit'' suicide. Wait, I thought ''we'' were cynical. ...Whatever, it doesn't matter. Oh yeah, you're right. She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have?  Oh my God. It's worse than we thought! They made her ''emo''!  Has she said one word to either one of you guys? She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids.  There must something else going on here.  It's not your mom, it's me. What did they do you? At that camp? Don't take this the wrong way, but... I think that place turned you into an emo. Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate?  I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they ''knew'' what they were doing. What? Nooo waaaaay. Omigodnowaaaaaaaaay.  No way no waaaaaay! It's worse than we thought. No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like "I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world" and I was like "No waaay!" and she was like "Yeah, soon it will be too late." and I was all "No waaay!" Yeah, so listen: call up Firkle and meet me at Village Inn. I gotta run home, but I'll be there in ten minutes.  Can't now, Mom! I've got an emergency! What?? What the hell are you talking about?! No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!!  They're eviillll! What? Where are you ta- No! NO!!  Get me out of here! Let me go! What the hell are you doing to people?! Wait a minute. Emos are plants?  Oh, it all makes sense now!  No.  What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo! What the...?  No, NOOOOOOOOO!  Kick it over! Stop the plant!  Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies. Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo?  Shoot it!  I have no idea what's going on. It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show. No, you just kind of did it on your own.
