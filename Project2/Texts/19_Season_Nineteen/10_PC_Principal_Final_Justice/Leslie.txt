 Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America.  Yeah, just feeling butterflies. And my hands are freezing! Thank you, Kyle.  The principal has become our biggest problem. We need a news headline that will draw him back to town. We can't just hide, Kyle. We have to let people know PC is the enemy before it's too late. The principal is going to try and make up some crazy story. That's what PC people do. You have to get in front of everyone and tell them what you've learned. But why? I came to you because I had heard how good you were at getting messages across. That and because...  I thought you were cute. Well... I can't go with you, you know. It's too dangerous. Where? Gun show?  Every time you block us, we get smarter. Every time you try to stop us, we are more. If one plan fails, we will plan another. You will never be rid of ads!
