The opening shots this week parody those of "I Shouldn't Be Alive", with dramatic zooms and pans. Then a shot of Stan running in zipline gear

Stan

Kyle! [his voice echoes as he looks around frantically]

-----


The opening shots again

Narrator

Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [A shot of Kyle running, also in zipline gear, through the forest.]

Kyle

AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! [a shot of Cartman moving down the zip line helplessly]

Cartman

Somebody help us! [motion blur back to opening shots]

Narrator

Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out. [a shot each of Kyle, Kenny, and Stan screaming, then of a bloodied Stan on the zip line, then of Cartman, then of Kyle] The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.

Kyle

[being interviewed] We were stuck. We were completely stuck. [cut to Cartman running]

Cartman

Kyle, hurry! [a shot of Stan with Kyle]

Stan

Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! [a shot each of Kyle, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman screaming, then of the four boys on a wooden platform at the top of a zip line, then of Cartman, then of a trip through the esophagus, then of Cartman, and back to the first shot]

Narrator

For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of "I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining".

Cartman

[inside a van, in a window seat] Oh God!

Stan

[running towards the camera] No!

-----


"The events in this film took place over 4 hours in the Colorado Rockies"

Stan

Help! We're trapped! [A shot of all four boys bloodied and woozy] We've gotta get out of here!

-----


"This is a true story."

A bright sun rises over the town of South Park

Narrator

It's the last day of Spring break, [a shot of the school] and all over the small mountain town of South Park, [back at the park, kids play on the basketball court or go down a slide, or fly kites.] students are trying to have as much fun as possible. [a girl shows off her dog to two friends, a boy aims his water gun at another boy and runs after him, two other boys toss a football between them. The camera stops at a table with four boys. Tow of them sit at the bench, two others stand. Kenny plays with a twig] For ten year old Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the last day has come too soon.

Stan

[being interviewed] We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.

Kyle

We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide

Cartman

Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.

Kenny

[offended] (What?!)

Cartman

Look at his lip. [to Kenny] You've got herpes, dude.

Kenny

[throws the twig away] (This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)

Cartman

No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.

Stan

Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?

Kyle

[being interviewed] And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.

Cartman

Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!

Kyle

We've definitely not done that before!

Stan

I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.

Kyle

Cool! Ziplining.

Cartman

Ziplining. Hell yeah.

Narrator

Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. [a shot of the boys chattering in the back]

Cartman

[being interviewed] We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.

Cartman

Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him. [leans over to see how close his finger can reach without touching] Zi- [Kenny puts his right mitten over his mouth and Cartman pulls his left hand back playfully] Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.

Kenny

(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)

Cartman

Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister. [laughs] You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.

Narrator

It's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter. [a shot of the boys cheering as they approach Backcountry Adventures]

-----


Inside Backcountry Adventures, day

Clerk

Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?

Stan

Yeah.

Clerk

All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.

Kyle

[being interviewed] And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."

Clerk

[he's got the boys dressed up] All right, you guys look ready to zipline!

Cartman

Alright!

Clerk

Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.

Stan

[being interviewed] And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" [a shot of the boys entering the waiting room, where there are seven other people waiting]

Woman 1

Hi there.

Man 1

Hello.

Woman 2

Hi

Narrator

The boys have just made a sobering discovery. [a shot of Stan's internal organs and spine] For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down. [this is shown] The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family. [Stan's brain and skull are shown] But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour.

Woman 2

[quite pregnant] Hey, how are you?

Stan

[mimicking] Good. How are you?

Kyle

[being interviewed] So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. [the couple arrives]

Clerk

Alright, our last zipliners are here. [Kyle and Cartman are visibly angry]

Man 2

Sorry we made you wait, everybody. [A shot of Kyle's mouth interior is shown]

Narrator

Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, "Dude, fuck you!"

Kyle

We don't mind.

Cartman

[being interviewed] Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. [the benches are rearranged so the zipliners can watch a TV screen above them]

Clerk

Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!

Michael

[who's just the clerk, naturally] Hey there Michael. [Everyone behind the boys laughs.]

Stan

[being interviewed] It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. [return to the tour]

Michael

Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.

Michael

Thanks Michael. [turns off the TV] Anybody have any questions?

Cartman

...No.

Man 2

I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? [the boys are stunned that this needs to be done]

Stan

[being interviewed] "Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"

Michael

Let's get out there and get zippin'! [everyone rises and heads out of the waiting room]

Kyle

Jesus Christ!

Cartman

Finally!

Narrator

The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse.

-----


Outside Backcountry Adventures

Michael

Here we go guys! Zipliniiin'! [goes into an open-leg stance, makes a fist with his left hand, holding out the thumb and pinkie]

Guide 1

[a woman, waiting by a van that has been out earlier in the day] Everyone just step on in the shuttle. [opens the van's sliding door. The zipliners head for it]

Stan

...Shuttle?

Kyle

How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?

Michael

It's about forty-five minutes.

Narrator

It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear. [a look at Kyle's brain] His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word "shuttle" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons [this is shown] that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. [two images of overloaded shuttle buses appear, then footage of the Space Shuttle Challenger going up and exploding, and Kyle is scared]

Cartman

Well, come on, we don't have a choice. [leads the others to the shuttle van.]

-----


The shuttle ride, later. It sure is bumpy.

Michael

Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?

Stan

Uh that's okay.

Man 3

Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought- [Cartman begins to mutter angrily]

Narrator

[hour 2] It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle.

Michael

We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!

Adults

Wooo!

Narrator

But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing. [Cartman is drinking some Mountain Dew from a can. The camera looks around the van] Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen. [the camera goes down Eric's esophagus] Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months. [the camera comes back up the esophagus and out Cartman's mouth] And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back down Cartman's throat] The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas. [a quick journey through the intestines is shown] When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter. [the sphincter is shown] Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage. [this is shown, along with Kyle's reaction]

Kyle

Dude, did you fart?!

Cartman

Mmmm, no?

Michael

Alright buys, we're here! [The van pulls up to the first entrace to Zipline Adventures. Both Stan and Kenny look sleepy]

Stan

Thank God. [everyone is out of the van as Guide 1 goes up to the launch pad two stories up. The pad is attached to a pine tree]

Michael

Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?

Cartman

The trees' biology?

Michael

We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.

Stan

I think we're good.

Man 2

[raises his left hand] I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.

Michael

Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-

Stan

[being interviewed] So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! [Cartman is hooked up]

Michael

Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work. [a shot of the tour group] Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out "Shockabra!", look up and give the camera a nice "shockabra" [two fists with thumbs and pinkies extended]. Alright, you ready?

Cartman

Yeah. [Michael shortens the strap between Cartman and the zipline, and holds him up]

Michael

Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?

Cartman

Yeah.

Michael

Alright, let's hear you say "Zipliiine!"

Cartman

Zipliiine. [Michael sends him on his way]

Michael

[voice-over] Shockabra! [Cartman holds out his fists as indicated above and the camera takes his picture]

Guide 1

Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!

Kyle

Well? How was it, Cartman?

Cartman

Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!

Stan

[as Kyle is prepped] Oh, really??

Cartman

Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!

Michael

Alright Kyle, give me a "Zipliiine!"

Kyle

Zipline. [Michael sends him on his way]

Michael

Shockabra! [does the fists. Kyle does the fists too and the camera takes his picture, but he's mad]

Kyle

[being interviewed] It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.

Narrator

After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens.

Michael

Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! [the others cheer, but the boys are worried.]

Cartman

[being interviewed] "The next zipline? What are you talking about?"

Kyle

E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?

Michael

This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.

Stan

[being interviewed] And it was like WHAM. [makes a fist with his right hand and punches his left handn with it.]

Kyle

STOP!

Cartman

NOOOO!

Guide

Everyone back in the shuttle!

Kyle, Cartman

NOOOO! [the adults and a fifth kid get back into the van]

Narrator

The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. [the boys scream and some scens of the next ziplines flash by: Michael sends someone down the zipline, he plays guitar during a break "led me through that"]

Guide

Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?

Man 2

Yes.

Boys

AAAA! [shots of Kyle, Kenny, and Stan]

Adults

"Ack" went the little green frog one day. "Ack" went the little green frog...

Cartman

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [opening shots return]

Michael

Let 'er rip! [sends Man 2 on his way]

Man 4

Zipliiine!

Narrator

Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.

Michael

Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.

Kyle

Wugh!

Narrator

Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.

Pete

But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- [Woman 1 is shown going down, then man 1, then]

Man 2

[with his wife] Could you get another picture of us? [hands Kyle the camera]

Kyle

[frustrated] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [a shot of the whole group is shown]

Narrator

The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.

Cartman

[on his way down a zipline.] I'm so fucking bored! [Hour 3 arrives. Michael sends the next zipliner on down. The others cheer her on]

Michael

Alright, you going next, Ricky? [hooks Ricky up and sends him down]

The boys

[on the ground] Help! Somebody! Help us! [the adults on the launch pad cheer the next zipliner down]

Kyle

It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.

Stan

There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.

Kyle

[grabs Stan's arms] Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! [another zipliner goes down]

Zipliner

Zipline!

Adults

Woohoo!

Cartman

We should have never listened to you, Kyle.

Kyle

Me?!

Cartman

Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"

Kyle

Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!

Cartman

I brought it up because you already brought it up!

Stan

[being interviewed] That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.

Kyle

You fat piece of shit!

Cartman

Fuck you Kyle!

Stan

Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!

Cartman, Kyle

Yes!

Stan

Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?

Narrator

But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea. [the camera goes down Cartman's throat.] Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea. [the camera goes back up his throat and out his mouth] But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back in] His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste. [a quick trip through Cartman's intestines, as before] The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear. [this is shown, and the smell wafts up into Kyle's nose] Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb.

Kyle

DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!

Cartman

Nnnn-mo...

Stan

[being interviewed] So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.

Michael

All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch.

Guide

[standing in a covered lunch area] Come in by the waterfall, gang! [it's a small waterfall]

Stan

Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?

Man 2

Skip a free lunch? Not me! [runs to the lunch area. The other zipliners follow]

Guide

Wo wants sandwiches? [pulls out sealed sandwiches from a portable ice box] We got ...turkey. [Man 2 takes that one] Ham. [another zipliner takes that one] Turkey ham. [another zipliner takes that one...]

Pete

[in the background] Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. [in the foreground the boys are sitting on their own log with the word HELP on the ground before them made with twigs and branches]

Cartman

Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! [keeps sipping the Double Dew]

Kyle

The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!

Cartman

This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew. [at the bottom of the can is a blurb saying "DEW THE MATH!"] Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.

Kyle

You're in a forest! Go take a crap!

Cartman

If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!

Stan

[runs up to the tour guides] Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.

Michael

Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?

Stan

...Yyyeah.

Guide

That's not herpes, it's a cold sore.

Michael

Right, sorry.

Stan

Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.

Michael

Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.

Some adults

Zipline! Wooo!

Guide

What about the stables?

Michael

Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.

Kyle

[being interviewed] Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.

Rancher

Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?

Stan

Yea, please!

Rancher

Well I think we can set ya up.

Kyle

Oh, thank God!

Stan

You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.

Rancher

Step right out here, we'll get you going. [leads the boys out to a horseback riding tour] Got four more for you, Duncan. [All the riders wave and say hello, and a few take pictures]

Cartman

NOOO! [opening shots return]

Narrator

Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.

Kyle

AAAAH! [the boys are now shown on horseback in this order: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny]

Cartman

[still aching] Eeeeugh.

Narrator

Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. [the camera tries some dramatic moves]

Kyle

Can we please go faster?!

Kenny

(I can't take it!)

Duncan

We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.

Kyle

AAAAAAAAAAH!

Cartman

Uh oh. [lets out a wet fart]

Rider 1

[to Kyle] So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning.

Narrator

An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining"

-----


The lunch site, moments later.

Duncan

This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls. Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?

Rider 2

Well I certainly would! [Other riders do too. Nearby, Kyle has collapsed]

Stan

Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!

Kyle

Just go. Go without me.

Stan

No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!

Kyle

I can't take it anymore. [his voice gets weaker] Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.

Stan

[being interviewed] I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.

Stan

[returns from his search quite excited] You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!

Cartman

A marina?

Stan

We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!

Kyle

What's the point?

Stan

Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! [an announcer says the following lines]

-----


"The following program contains graphic re-enactments that may be disturbing to some audience members." The marina. This is the live-action segment of the episode

Narrator

Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [shots of the boys screaming on various parts of the boat] Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat [named Puffin] which is only allowed to go five miles an hour. [some footage is dropped to speed up the boat in time-lapse form]

Kyle

Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!

Cartman

Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!

Kyle

Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!

Narrator

The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.

Cartman

Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?

Kenny

[slurring his speech] I don't know. I really don't give a shit.

Narrator

For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat" [more shots of the boys on the Puffin]

Kyle

Oh no. [Cartman lowers a 20-oz. bottle of Mountain Dew] You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!

-----


"The events in this film took place over 4 hours in the Colorado Rockies." Cartman is shitting over the side of the boat, Stan screams, Kyle and Kenny vomit over other sides, Cartman continues to shit

Kenny

Beavers! [a beaver is swimming in the water]

-----


"This is a true story."

-----


The boys are resting on a bench on the boat now

Narrator

After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining.

Stan

[being interviewed] The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.

Cartman

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Narrator

If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die. [Stan looks ready to sleep. Cartman takes a swig of Mountain Dew]

Kyle

Here! [takes Cartman's bottle] Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!

Kyle

[being interviewed] I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.

Cartman

I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!

Kenny

Hey. [tugs on Cartman, who turns to look at him] Fuck you, Cartman.

-----


The Puffin, some time later

Narrator

Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [individual shots of the boys. They all have oral herpes now] And just when it seems it can't get any worse... [the boys are nodding off again]

Stan

...Kenny? Kenny! [Kenny has slid down on the seat, but his eyes are open]

Narrator

Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.

Kyle

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!

Cartman

No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!

Kyle

IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!

Stan

[being interviewed] And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"

Stan

[rises and walks a bit] Stop it! It was me! My idea.

Cartman

You?!

Stan

Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out the brochure for Backcountry Adventures, then looks at it for a few seconds] I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. [Kyle and Cartman look at each other]

Kyle

So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!

Stan

[turns to face them] If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. [the camera pans down and sure enough, the offer is on the brochure cover: Sign up 3 friends and get an iPod NANO!!!]

Kyle

You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!

Stan

I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.

Cartman

[points at Stan] You... You killed Kenny! [Stan begins to weep]

Kyle

You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! [a shot of Kenny, then a shot of the three surviving boys crying. Kyle cries on Cartman's shoulder and Cartman comforts him]

Kyle

[being interviewed] How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.

Stan

[being interviewed, crying] The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back. [wipes away the flowing tears] I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.

Narrator

But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. [the boys look around, startled]

Cartman

[being interviewed] It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.

Cartman

You came for us!

Kyle

Mr. Hankey!

Stan

Thank you. [whispers] Mr. Hankey. [Mr. Hankey has landed on the boat, at the top of an armrest]

Mr. Hankey

[without the falsetto voice] Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. [the boys are overjoyed at their good fortune]

Cartman

[being interviewed] We were saved. It was over.

Narrator

After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter. [shown, the images are back to the cartoon form] In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven. [a jet plane made of poo] From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express. [The ziplining Shockabra pictures are shown] Four friends, turn apart by tragedy [Kenny's image vanishes, leaving the forest background in place], would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents. [Mr. Hankey delivers them personally. The parents are distraught] And the boys received treatment for their herpes. [two paramedics treat Stan and Cartman as Mr. Hankey looks on from above. Stan and Cartman focus on Mr. Hankey.]

Cartman

[being interviewed] No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.

Narrator

[shots of the scenes being described are shown] Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining. [a lecture tour. Stan is shown on stage with a "No on Ziplining" logo] His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman, [shown as a mountaineer] he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math.

Cartman

[being interviewed] It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. [takes a long sip]
