==Fictional character biography==
Willis Stryker, one of Luke's childhood friends, first appeared in ''Luke Cage: Hero for Hire'' #1. He is known as Diamondback for his mastery of knives,{{clarify|date=September 2020}} including specially-gimmicked knives that explode, release toxic gases or create sonic waves.

Willis Stryker was born and raised in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]]. He grew up on the street alongside Carl Lucas, his best friend and future partner. He was recruited into one of the local gangs, The Rivals. The gang consisted mostly of Carl Lucas, Stryker, [[Shades (comics)|Shades]] and [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]].<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> They engaged in many gang fights with The Diablos, a rival gang. He also committed petty crimes and worked for a crime lord named Sonny Caputo. Carl changed his life and found an honest job while Willis became a skilled gangster but they remained good friends.<ref>''Cage'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A girl named Reva Connors loved them both but was more attracted to Carl. Willis, devastated by jealousy, framed him by hiding drugs where Carl lived, causing Carl Lucas to be sent to prison. The drugs belonged to the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] so they hunted Willis but ended up killing Reva.<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Carl changed his name to Luke Cage and escaped from prison thanks to his bulletproof skin and searched for revenge. Luke Cage was attacked by hitmen hired by Diamondback. When the attack failed, Diamondback has his inventor Gadget-Man create new gimmicked switch blades to deal with Cage and kidnapped [[Claire Temple]]. Tracking Diamondback to his lair, Luke was surprised to find that it was his old friend Stryker. Diamondback battled Cage who hoped to clear his name. During the fight, Diamondback fell through a skylight and was blown up by one of his own trick switchblades, ruining any hope Luke had that Stryker could clear his name. Just then Claire arrived with [[Noah Burstein]] (the man who conducted the prison experiments) and the police, and Luke wonders if Burstein will turn him over to the authorities.<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Diamondback later turned up alive. He then began to make plans to become a crime lord where he will start in Harlem and then rule the crime on the Eastern Seaboard.

Using toxic dust, Diamondback struck Luke Cage and proceeded to beat him up.<ref>''The Defenders'' vol. 5 #1.

While gloating over Iron Fist, Diamondback was caught off guard when Jessica Jones attacked him.

He's placed along with the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]], who was captured by Daredevil and Luke Cage.

He later shows up at Black Cat's apartment, where he shoots her multiple times in retaliation for Cat saving Luke Cage.<ref>''The Defenders'' vol. 5 #3-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>
