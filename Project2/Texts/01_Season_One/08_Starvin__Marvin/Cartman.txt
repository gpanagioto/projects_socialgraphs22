That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that? KICK ASS!! When do we get the sports watch? You vas-deferens! I get to wear it first, you guys. Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said. When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out? Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk? I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them! Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling! Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!

We found a Etheropian, can we keep him? Sweet. No no! He's ''my'' son! I adopted him. Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor. Ahh! Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income. Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too? You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers. This is what you eat ''before'' you eat, to make you more hungry. Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. No Starvin' Marvin, that's ''my'' pot-pie. Oh yeah, you're right. Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here... Yeah, that's right. No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn. No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin! Oh well, back to the poor country with you. B-huh, huh. Yeah, right. Hey, hey, what's going on?!
