Hello, Satan!   What took yo so long, baby? Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy. Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything. Would you like a drink? These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot! Here, have another drink.   Ewuh, I'm all greasy. Last night was awesome! Are we together again now? Screw him!! I know how to solve this little problem.   There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict. Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you! I thought I killed you! Right, right. A ''walk?''  Is this some kind of trick? Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head? You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy!  Ah hahaha! '''''Aggghhh!'''''  '''''Die, pussy!'''''  '''''Aagghh!'''''  Hell, you can't leave ''me'', Satan! I won't let you!   There you are! You know you can't live without me. Now '''''get that ass back to bed!''''' You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me. Aw, you little..prick!  What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow. Let me in where?  What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?! Ey, who the hell are you? Nooo! N-'''''nooooooooooo!'''''
