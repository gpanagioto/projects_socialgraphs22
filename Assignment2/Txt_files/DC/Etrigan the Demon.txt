'''Etrigan the Demon''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[antihero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by [[Jack Kirby]], Etrigan is a demon from [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] who, despite his violent tendencies, usually finds himself allied with the forces of good, mainly because of the alliance between the heroic characters of the [[DC Universe]] and '''Jason Blood''', a human to whom Etrigan is bound. Etrigan is commonly depicted as a muscular humanoid creature with orange or yellow skin, horns, red eyes, and pointed, webbed ears, who frequently speaks in rhymes. The character was originally based in [[Gotham City]], leading to numerous team-ups with [[Batman]].

Etrigan was inspired by a comic strip of ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' in which the eponymous character dressed as a demon. Kirby gave his creation the same appearance as Valiant's mask.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/01/08/comic-book-legends-revealed-189/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #189|first= Brian|last= Cronin|date= January 8, 2009|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100818045437/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/01/08/comic-book-legends-revealed-189/|archive-date=August 18, 2010 |url-status= live|access-date= January 6, 2013|quote= Jack Kirby based the face of Etrigan the Demon on a mask from an old Prince Valiant story by Hal Foster.}}</ref> The mask may have been inspired by the silent film ''[[Häxan]]''. Since his conception, Etrigan has been adapted into several forms of media outside of comics, including animated series, films, and video games.

==Publication history==
Etrigan the Demon first appeared in ''The Demon'' #1 (September 1972)<ref>{{cite book|last1= Overstreet|first1= Robert M.|title= [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]|edition= 49th|publisher= [[Gemstone Publishing]]|date= 2019|location= Timonium, Maryland|pages= 628|isbn= 978-1603602334}}</ref> and was created by [[Jack Kirby]]. He created the Demon at the behest of DC, who saw it as likely to be more commercially successful than the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] and thus cancelled [[New Gods]] and [[Forever People]] to facilitate his working on the new title.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morrow |first1=John |title=Old Gods and New |date=April 2021 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |isbn=978-1-60549-098-4 |page=114-5 |edition=First |quote="One afternoon, as he was working on Forever People #11, [Jack] received a very disturbing call of the good news/bad news variety. The Good News: Kamandi and The Demon looked like sure hits. The Bad News: In order to make sure Jack could keep on doing both sure hits, a decision had been made to 'suspend' Forever People and New Gods." [quote of Mark Evanier]}}</ref> According to [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby had no interest in horror comics, but created Etrigan in response to a demand from DC for a horror character. Kirby was annoyed that the first issue sold so well that DC required him to do sixteen issues and abandon the Fourth World titles before he was done with them.<ref>{{cite book|last = Evanier|first = Mark|author-link = Mark Evanier|chapter= Introduction|title = Jack Kirby's The Demon|pages = 3–5 |publisher = DC Comics|date = 2008|isbn = 978-1401219161}}</ref>

Etrigan returned for a four-issue miniseries in 1987, written and illustrated by ''[[Grendel (comics)|Grendel]]'' creator [[Matt Wagner]]. [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] followed this with an Etrigan feature in ''[[Action Comics|Action Comics Weekly]]'' #636-641 and a second ongoing title in 1990. The 1990 series lasted 58 issues, two ''Annual''s and one #0 issue. [[Garth Ennis]] took over the title beginning with issue #40. Ennis' run included the first appearance of his character [[Hitman (DC Comics)|Hitman]]. This series was followed by a miniseries, ''Driven Out''. Following this, John Byrne's ''Blood of the Demon'' lasted 17 issues, and ignored much of the continuity (i.e. Harry Matthews is human, and not a pillow with human facial features) that took place after Kirby's initial run.

While his first monthly [[comic book]] series was short-lived, and his second was canceled after five years, Etrigan remains a popular supporting character with occasional additional miniseries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/demon.htm |title=The Demon |first=Don |last=Markstein |year=2009 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6TkFEczcI?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/demon.htm |archive-date=October 31, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy}}</ref> Popular series in which Etrigan has appeared include [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', [[Kevin Smith]]'s ''[[Green Arrow]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Widening Gyre]]'', Garth Ennis's ''[[Hitman (DC Comics)|Hitman]]'', and ''[[Cosmic Odyssey (comics)|Cosmic Odyssey]]'' by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Mike Mignola]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre/Post-''Crisis''===
Etrigan, son of the demon [[Belial in popular culture#Comics|Belial]], is summoned by the [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]], his half-brother.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Matt Wagner|Wagner, Matt]]|penciller= [[Amy Reeder Hadley|Reeder Hadley, Amy]]|inker= Reeder Hadley, Amy|story= Chapter the First By the Runes|title= [[Madame Xanadu]]|volume= 2|issue= #1|date= August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Wagner, Matt|penciller= Reeder Hadley, Amy|inker= Reeder Hadley, Amy|story= War. Ancient scourge of mankind, of prosperity, of life itself|title= Madame Xanadu|volume= 2|issue= #2|date= September 2008}}</ref> Unable to gain the creature's secrets, he bonds the demon with Jason Blood, a knight in [[King Arthur (DC Comics)|King Arthur]]'s [[Camelot]]. This renders Jason immortal, which he alternately considers either a penance or a curse.

In modern times, Jason Blood resurfaces as a prominent demonologist in [[Gotham City]]. Jason is called to the crypt of Merlin and discovers a poem that causes him to switch places with Etrigan (appearing to transform him into Etrigan). To his misfortune, he is followed by the long-lived [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine le Fey]], who lusts for Merlin's secrets. That leads to Etrigan's first major battle. Over the years, Etrigan both clashes with and occasionally aids Earth's heroes, guided by his own whims and Jason's attempts to turn his infernal power to good use.

Some time after his first appearance, Etrigan begins speaking in rhyme due to a promotion in [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alan Moore|Moore, Alan]]|penciller= [[Stephen R.

Some time after this, Jason Blood and Glenda Mark attempt to separate Blood and Etrigan, an event which leads to Blood's ally, Harry Matthews, being devoured, and later turned into a pillow, by Belial. At the end of these events, Etrigan and Blood are separated.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Matt Wagner|Wagner, Matt]]|penciller= Wagner, Matt|inker= Nichols, Art|story= Direction from the Darkness|title= Demon|volume= 2|issue= #1|date= January 1987}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Wagner, Matt|penciller= Wagner, Matt|inker= Nichols, Art|story= Descension from Below|title= Demon|volume= 2|issue= #2|date= February 1987}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Wagner, Matt|penciller= Wagner, Matt|inker= Nichols, Art|story= So Made He in His Likeness|title= Demon|volume= 2|issue= #3|date= March 1987}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Wagner, Matt|penciller= Wagner, Matt|inker= Nichols, Art|story= Begins Our Tale of Woe|title= Demon|volume= 2|issue= #4|date= April 1987}}</ref> Both began to age and during the event known as ''[[Cosmic Odyssey (comics)|Cosmic Odyssey]]'', Blood and Etrigan were merged once again.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Jim Starlin|Starlin, Jim]]|penciller= [[Mike Mignola|Mignola, Mike]]|inker= Garzon, Carlos|story= Disaster|title= [[Cosmic Odyssey (comics)|Cosmic Odyssey]]|issue= #2|date= 1988}}</ref>

After the remerging, the relationship between Blood and Etrigan becomes even more contentious. Drawn to Hell by the Archfiend Asteroth, Etrigan stops Asteroth's attempt to sacrifice Glenda Mark, Randu Singh, Merlin and Blood himself (in Hell, Blood and Etrigan were, at the time, separated).<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Alan Grant (writer)|Grant, Alan]]|penciller= Pacella, Mark|inker= [[William Wray (artist)|Wray, Bill]]|story= The Book of Pandemonium|title= [[Action Comics]] Weekly|issue= #636|date= January 24, 1989}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Grant, Alan|penciller= Pacella, Mark|inker= Wray, Bill|story= Never Trust a Demon|title= Action Comics Weekly|issue= #637|date= January 31, 1989}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Grant, Alan|penciller= Pacella, Mark|inker= Wray, Bill|story= The Road to Hell|title= Action Comics Weekly|issue= #638|date= February 7, 1989}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Grant, Alan|penciller= Pacella, Mark|inker= Wray, Bill|story= Witches|title= Action Comics Weekly|issue= #639|date= February 21, 1989}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Grant, Alan|penciller= Pacella, Mark|inker= Wray, Bill|story= Abandon Hope|title= Action Comics Weekly|issue= #640|date= February 28, 1991}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Grant, Alan|penciller= Pacella, Mark|inker= Wray, Bill|story= Welcome to Hell|title= Action Comics Weekly|issue= #641|date= March 7, 1991}}</ref> Etrigan followed these events by overthrowing the triumvirate of leaders in Hell (Lucifer, Belial and Beezlebub) and taking the symbol of authority in Hell, the Crown of Horns, for himself.

When Jason Blood's daughter was born, he decided to destroy Etrigan and hired [[Hitman (DC Comics)|metahuman hitman Tommy Monaghan]] to help him. After a battle against both Merlin and Etrigan, the two of them rescued the baby and Blood was able to steal the Demon's heart, essentially neutralizing the demon and binding him to Jason's will. At the end of the battle to gain the Demon's heart, Jason Blood left the child, Kathryn Mark, with her mother, Glenda Mark. Jason told Glenda before he had left: "Take care of our daughter, Glenda. I think it would be best if she never knew about her father". Blood then skipped out on paying Monaghan the $2,000,000 he had promised.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Garth Ennis|Ennis, Garth]]|penciller= [[John McCrea (comics)|McCrea, John]]|inker= McCrea, John|story= Suffer The Children part 1|title= The Demon|volume= 3|issue= #52|date= November 1994}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Ennis, Garth|penciller= McCrea, John|inker= McCrea, John|story= Suffer The Children part 2|title= The Demon|volume= 3|issue= #53|date= December 1994}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Ennis, Garth|penciller= McCrea, John|inker= McCrea, John|story= Suffer The Children part 3|title= The Demon|volume= 3|issue= #54|date= January 1995}}</ref> Etrigan became listless and ceased to rhyme. When Monaghan needed an edge against the demon Mawzir, he conned Blood into returning to Gotham and using Etrigan to retrieve the Ace of Winchesters, an anti-demon rifle, from Hell, all while preparing to force the demonologist to let the monster onto Earth again. Despite the real risk that Etrigan would kill ''him'' in vengeance, Monahgan traded Etrigan his heart for the Ace of Winchesters, once more forcing Blood to have the full burden of their merging and returning Etrigan to his full strength (though Etrigan reneged on the deal and tried to kill Monaghan ''anyway'').<ref>{{cite book|last = Ennis|first = Garth|author2=McCrea, John|title = [[Hitman (DC Comics)|Hitman Vol. 4: The Ace of Killers]]|publisher = DC Comics|date = 2000|pages = 144|isbn = 978-1563896149}}</ref>

Despite Blood's own doubts about himself, when the [[Justice League]] vanished during their attempt to rescue [[Aquaman]] from the past, [[Batman]]'s emergency program — designed to assemble a substitute Justice League in the event that the originals were ever killed — selected Blood as the team's magic expert, a pre-recorded message Batman had left for Blood assuring the sorcerer that he would not give Etrigan the keys to the Watchtower unless he was certain that he could be controlled. While working with the team, Jason spent some time reinforcing the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]]'s magical defences. During the subsequent fight with [[Gamemnae]], Jason sacrificed himself to free [[Zatanna]] from her control, although he later escaped Gamemnae's quagmire spell thanks to the [[Martian Manhunter]] telepathically prompting his transformation into Etrigan.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Joe Kelly (comics writer)|Kelly, Joe]]|penciller= [[Doug Mahnke|Mahnke, Doug]]|inker= Nguyen, Tom|story= Tragic Kingdom|title= [[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]|issue= #75|date= January 2003}}</ref> The crisis resolved, Jason handed his duties as the League's magic expert over to [[Manitou Raven]], newly arrived in the present, before departing.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Kelly, Joe|penciller= LaRosa, Lewis|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= Picking up the Pieces!|title= JLA|issue= #76|date= February 2003}}</ref>

The series ''Blood of the Demon'', plotted and drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and scripted by [[Will Pfeifer]], began in May 2005. Etrigan apparently loses the restrictions imposed upon him by the wizard Merlin which turned him from evil, caused by his "murder" at the exact moment he was transforming from his human self, Jason Blood, into his demon self. It turns out that the incident has resulted in Jason Blood being able to exert some will over Etrigan's violent nature, whereas previously the two remained separate, only one existing at a time. ''Blood of the Demon'' ended with issue #17 in July 2006.

Etrigan later attempts to use the Trident of [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]] to take control of Hell. A makeshift [[Shadowpact]] team successfully takes the Trident from him and flees to the supernatural [[List of locations of the DC Universe#Sites|Oblivion Bar]]. Etrigan follows and battles the team inside the bar. He is turned into stone via magical pistols and is used as a hat rack. The pistols' magic would return Etrigan to normal at sunrise, which never happens within the bar.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Willingham|Willingham, Bill]]|penciller= Derenick, Tom|inker= [[Wayne Faucher|Faucher, Wayne]]|story= The Lucifer Trident: Part Three of the Demon Triptych|title= [[Shadowpact]]|issue= #11|date= May 2007}}</ref>

Etrigan takes part in the war for control of Hell on behalf of [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], duelling [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]. Later, due to the effects of a magical drug [[Blaze and Satanus|Satanus]] had infested Hell with, he was transformed into a soulless physical human, a perfect duplicate of Jason Blood. Blood, meanwhile, has taken steps as to interfere with any possible attempts of Etrigan's to re-merge.<ref>{{cite book |last=Giffen |first=Keith |author2=Derenick, Tom |author3=Sienkiewicz, Bill |author3-link=Bill Sienkiewicz |author4=Justiniano |author4-link=Justiniano |title= [[Reign in Hell]] |date=2009 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=978-1401223137}}</ref>

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Blood's body is possessed by [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], who invokes Etrigan's transformation, using his flames to hold back the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter J.]]|penciller= [[Ardian Syaf|Syaf, Ardian]]|inker= Dell, John; Cifuentes, Vicente|story= Who Burns Who, Part One|title= [[Blackest Night|Blackest Night: Batman]]|issue= #1|date= October 2009}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Tomasi, Peter J.|penciller= Syaf, Ardian|inker= Cifuentes, Vicente|story= Who Burns Who, Part Two|title= Blackest Night: Batman|issue= #2|date= November 2009}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Tomasi, Peter J.|penciller= Syaf, Ardian|inker= Cifuentes, Vicente|story= Who Burns Who, Conclusion|title= Blackest Night: Batman|issue= #3|date= December 2009}}</ref>

Etrigan briefly appears in the prelude to the [[Justice League|JLA]]/[[Justice Society of America|JSA]] crossover during the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' event. Etrigan travels to Germany in order to find a crashed meteorite that contains an unconscious [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] and is drawn into a confrontation with the Justice League after attacking a squad of German superheroes. He mocks the League by claiming they are an inferior team of substitutes, but is ultimately defeated when [[Donna Troy]] uses her Lasso of Persuasion to force him back into his Jason Blood form. Jason apologizes for the trouble he caused and departs from the scene, but not before warning [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] and his teammates that the meteorite possesses supernatural qualities. The meteor is later revealed to be the Starheart, a legendary entity that has the power to possess metahumans with magical or elemental abilities.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller= [[Mark Bagley|Bagley, Mark]]|inker= Hunter, Rob; [[Norm Rapmund|Rapmund, Norm]]|story= Brightest Day: The Devil In the Details|title= Justice League of America|volume= 2|issue= #44|date= June 2010}}</ref>

Etrigan is shown aiding the JLA during their mission into Hell, where he helps [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] defeat a demonic beast.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Prado, Joe|penciller= Prado, Joe|inker= Prado, Joe|story= Violence|title= JLA 80-Page Giant 2011|issue= #1|date= June 2011}}</ref> He also was the guide to the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] in their trip to Hell and led [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] to see the fate of his father, all the while amused by the confusion and pain they were suffering as a result of their visit.

===''The New 52''===
In ''[[The New 52]]'', the 2011 reboot of the [[DC Comics universe]], his past and origins are largely changed. Before the Dark Ages, Etrigan was a Rhyming Demon (one not yet good at rhyming) in Lucifer's service and after too many indignities, he led a rebellion. Lucifer waited until the last moment before handing him over to Merlin: the two had struck a deal. Jason of Norwich had been sent to Camelot as a scribe to Merlin and was growing frustrated with life, believing he was meant for greater things and suffering from rages. A prophecy showed that if Jason did not have some sort of quest to force him to heal himself, his rage would grow and cause him to kill his love, [[Madame Xanadu]]; at the Fall of Camelot, Merlin bonded Etrigan to Jason in an attempt to provide this quest.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]|penciller= [[Bernard Chang|Chang, Bernard]]|inker= Chang, Bernard|story= The Prologue|title= [[Demon Knights]]|issue= #0|date= November 2012}}</ref>

Now immortal, Jason and Etrigan came to an agreement and shared their existence. Madame Xanadu began traveling with Jason, only to find Etrigan had now begun falling for her as well and would slaughter innocents if he thought she and Jason were happy together. In order to placate the demon, she pretended to be in love with him and cuckolding Jason.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Cornell, Paul|penciller= Chang, Bernard; Neves, Diógenes|inker= Chang, Bernard; Albert, Oclair|story= The Ballad of Nimue & the Demon|title= Demon Knights|issue= #8|date= June 2012}}</ref>

Over the centuries, Jason became known as Jason o' the Blood and Etrigan continued to practice his rhymes. By the Dark Ages, he and Etrigan became the centre of a rag-tag team of adventurers, the "Demon Knights": Jason/Etrigan, Xanadu, [[Vandal Savage]], [[Shining Knight#Ystina|Shining Knight]], the Horsewoman, Saracen inventor Al Jabr (''The Numbers'' in Arabic) and the Amazon Exoristos (''The Exile'' in Greek). They first fought [[Mordru]] and the Questing Queen's army to a standstill before being tasked by the city of Alba Sarum to return Merlin to life at Avalon (both Jason and Etrigan were enraged at having missed the chance to get him to separate them). Etrigan plotted to betray his teammates' souls and Avalon itself to Lucifer, in order to curry his favour.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Cornell, Paul|penciller= Neves, Diógenes; Rocha, Robson|inker= Albert, Oclair; Ferreira, Julio; Rocha, Robson|story= The City Stilled by Death|title= Demon Knights|issue= #9|date= July 2012}}</ref> While he successfully manipulated the Knights into letting Hell invade Avalon (and secretly felt guilty about his treatment of Xanadu), he was himself captured and used by the Questing Queen to gain access as well. Lucifer believed Etrigan had done this deliberately and condemned him; outraged, the demon refused to serve anyone again. At the end of the battle, Jason was tasked as a member of Avalon's [[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]], but neither he nor Xanadu wanted to serve Merlin after having Etrigan forced on them again. Jason vowed to not let the demon out so often.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Cornell, Paul|penciller= Chang, Bernard|inker= Chang, Bernard|story= Torment|title= Demon Knights|issue= #13|date= December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Cornell, Paul|penciller= Chang, Bernard|inker= Chang, Bernard|story= Occupy Hell|title= Demon Knights|issue= #14 |date= January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= Cornell, Paul|penciller= Chang, Bernard|inker= Chang, Bernard|story= The Moment of Forgetting|title= Demon Knights|issue= #15|date= February 2013}}</ref>

In the present, Etrigan's body lies buried in London; it is explained that he was sealed there by his own friends because of his betrayal of them, but magic emanating from it is able to possess persons above, eventually freeing the demon, who promptly attacks [[Midnighter]] and [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Peter Milligan|Milligan, Peter]]|penciller= Conrad, Will; [[Cliff Richards|Richards, Cliff]]|inker= Conrad, Will; Richards, Cliff|story= The Rise of the Demon Part One: The Dreaming Tower|title= [[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]|volume= 3|issue= #13 |date= December 2012}}</ref> The entire Stormwatch then battles Etrigan, but even after being defeated, he is able to possess a host and flees.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Conrad, Will; Richards, Cliff|inker= Conrad, Will; Richards, Cliff|story= The Rise of the Demon, Part 2: London's Burning|title= Stormwatch|volume= 3|issue= #14|date= January 2013}}</ref>

==Characterization==
===Transformation incantation===
In order to transform into Etrigan, Blood must recite the poem from Merlin's crypt (though usually he only recites the last two lines). The poem does not have to be spoken for it to work. For instance, in one adventure, Blood is magically transformed into a fly. Unable to speak, Blood triggers the change by writing out the poem in the dust.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Haney, Bob|penciller=[[John Calnan|Calnan, John]]|story=Hour of the Serpent|title=The Brave and the Bold|volume=1|issue=#137|date=October 1977}}</ref>
{{quote|''Change! Change! O form of man!''<br/>''Free the prince forever damned!''<br/>''Free the might from fleshy mire!''<br/>''Boil the blood in the heart for fire!''<br/>''Gone! Gone! O form of man''<br/>''[And] rise the demon Etrigan!!''}}

To return to human form, a couplet must be recited, either by Etrigan or someone else in his hearing, but there are several versions of it:

{{quote|''Begone, begone, O Etrigan''<br/>''Resume once more the form of man!''}}

{{quote|''Gone now, O Etrigan''<br/>''And rise again'' (or ''rise once more'') ''the form of man!''}}

In other media such as the ''[[Justice League Dark (film)|Justice League Dark]]'' animated film, a different poem is used to return Etrigan to human form:

{{quote|''Since the battle's fought and won''. <br> ''Jason Blood with me is done''.}}

==Powers and abilities==
===Etrigan===
Even among demons, Etrigan is considered to be extremely powerful. He has mystically enhanced superhuman strength, to the degree that he can stand against other powerhouses such as [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]. He has a high degree of resistance to injury and can project hellfire from his body, usually from his mouth. He has a very high command of magic. Other powers include mystically enhanced fangs and claws, enhanced senses, super speed, agility, telepathy, energy blasts, and precognition. His sadomasochistic nature allows him to enjoy pain as if it were pleasure, making him generally fearless in the face of combat and torture. His healing factor can handle an incredible amount of damage, allowing him to recover from wounds that have removed large sections of his body. He also has pyrokinesis and cryokinesis enabling him to manipulate fire and ice.

===Jason Blood===
Jason Blood is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, including mastery in swordsmanship. Jason is adept at magic, and is often called upon to act as an advisor or investigator in occultic matters He has limited [[precognition]] and [[telepathy]]. Jason is technically immortal due to his connection to the demon Etrigan. He has the combined experiences of Etrigan since he was bonded to the demon. Jason Blood shares all of Etrigan's weaknesses.

===Weaknesses & Limitations===
Etrigan has all the limitations usually associated with a demon, including a weakness towards holy powers, holy water and iron. While his command of magic is strong, but considered to be less than his father, [[Belial]], and half-brother, [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] the Magician. Additionally, Belial granted the "power of Etrigan" to both Merlin and another son, Lord Scapegoat.He is also helpless against those with magical powers strong enough to control him, such as Morgaine le Fey. He is also said to have a strong frailty for certain sounds as well.

==Other versions==
* In ''Justice League Europe Annual'' #2, a time-lost [[Dimitri Pushkin]] ends up in the court of Camelot. He becomes a favorite of King Arthur, partly due to the futuristic capabilities of his armor. Filled with jealousy, Merlin summons Etrigan, who slays Dimitri with hellfire. This alternate-past is neutralized by the efforts of [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]].
* In the ''[[Speed Demon (Amalgam Comics)|Speed Demon]]'' one-shot, the second Speed Demon (Blaze Allen) is an amalgamation of the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|second Flash]], the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|second Ghost Rider]], and Etrigan (Speed Demon even refers to himself as Etrigan). The way Etrigan empowers Speed Demon is reminiscent of Marvel Comics' [[Zarathos]], a demon who was bonded to [[Ghost Rider]] in a similar manner.
* In ''Batman/Demon: A Tragedy'', Etrigan has been bonded to Bruce Wayne for a thousand years, with [[Alfred Pennyworth]] the cover identity adopted by Merlin as part of his atonement for summoning Etrigan all those centuries ago. Kept contained by Bruce Wayne's virtue, Etrigan only attacks criminals when released, but this depends on Bruce's ignorance of his condition, with Alfred/Merlin constantly re-casting the relevant spells to disguise Bruce as his own descendant and erasing his memories of his true existence to keep Etrigan contained.
* Etrigan appeared in the ''Superman and Batman vs. Vampires and Werewolves'' storyline, aiding Batman and Superman.
* In ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent]]: Superman's Reign'' #3, the Etrigan of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-9]] is revealed to be a human necromancer, part of the [[Dark Circle]] group.
* A sketch of an alternate version of Etrigan called "Superdemon" was featured in ''Final Crisis: Secret Files'' #1. Described as a denizen of Earth-17, Etrigan was sent to Earth by Merlin from the doomed Kamelot, where he entered the body of Jason Blood, son of a Kansas preacher. Over time, Jason learned to control the demon's powers, and now uses them to protect the world.
* In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' universe, Etrigan and the heroes are running from the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], until Etrigan is rescued by Canterbury Cricket. The heroes then hide in the bushes and learn Canterbury Cricket's origins, until the Amazons breach their hideout.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Carlin|Carlin, Mike]]|penciller= [[Rags Morales|Morales, Rags]]|inker= Bryant, Rick|story= The Scoundrel's Tale|title= Flashpoint: The Canterbury Cricket|issue= #1|date= August 2011}}</ref> During this same period, Etrigan joins the [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]]'s Resistance.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Geoff Johns|John, Geoff]]

* [[Kamandi]] and the Demon appear in "Devil's Play" (2013) written by [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Brandon Vietti]], art by Vietti, published in ''Joe Kubert Presents'' #6.
* Etrigan debuts in the fourth chapter of the Year Three ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''{{'}}s prequel comic series. He realizes Jason Blood has died when he feels agony and later reappears to attack Superman in the Hall of Justice. After getting the corrupt Man of Steel close enough, he reveals he has made a deal with Batman in which he becomes Etrigan's new host. The Dark Knight puts Superman into an enchanted coma.
* Etrigan appears in ''[[Batman: Damned]]''. Here, Etrigan is depicted as an underground rap artist who transforms into a more demonic appearance while he sings a song based on his rhyme. Etrigan also appears to have a loathing for Batman. Batman goes to interrogate him for information on the Joker's death. Etrigan refuses to tell Batman anything and turns the crowd against him. As the situation escalates, the building catches fire. Etrigan ultimately rescues Batman from the fire, though he tells [[John Constantine]] that he is only doing it so that Batman will experience more suffering.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Brian Azzarello|Azzarello, Brian]]|penciller= [[Lee Bermejo|Bermejo, Lee]]|inker= Bermejo, Lee|story= Batman: Damned Book Two|title= [[Batman: Damned]]|issue= 2|date= February 2019}}</ref>

In the alternate [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] timeline, Etrigan is a member of the Resistance and is seen fighting in the climactic battle between the Amazons and Atlantians. Though his death is not shown on screen, it is most likely he was killed by Aquaman's doomsday device.<ref>{{cite AV media|people= Krieg, Jim (writer); [[Jay Oliva|Oliva, Jay]] (director)|title= [[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]|medium= direct-to-video animated film|publisher= [[Warner Bros.
