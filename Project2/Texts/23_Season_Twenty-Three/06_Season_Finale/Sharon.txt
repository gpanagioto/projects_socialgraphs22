Kids, I have something to tell you, but I don't want you to be scared, okay? Daddy is... in police custody until there's a hearing. He could be in jail for a long time. It could be, sweetheart. We don't know. Of course it's possible, honey We probably have to sell the farm and move, back to town, and, sort of, live our lives without the marijuana business and without daddy.  Juts... try to stay hopeful, kids. Okay, you too, Shelly. Sheila, Gerald, hi. Oh that's so sweet, thank you. Other families have brought some stuff too. Come on in.  No running in the house, you little turkeys.  Oh, yeah. You know, just too painful. You know, they remind me of Randy. That's why I took Randy's pictures as well, because, you know, they remind me of Randy. Yeah, I've kind of made a list of all the things I might do. It's kind of a long list.
