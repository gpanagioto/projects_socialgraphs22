 I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay? No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to ''hide'' our emotions with math problems.  M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do, uh, four times four, m'kay? Okay, and so uh,  so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?  M'kay, Clyde? Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde. M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Tolkien, why don't you read your paper?  Uh, how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is? M'kay, Bebe? M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper? M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades. M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay?   Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?
