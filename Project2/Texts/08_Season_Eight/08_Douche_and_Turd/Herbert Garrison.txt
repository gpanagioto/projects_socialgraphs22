Oh, Jesus, not PETA again. All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we ''are'' going to change our school mascot. That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win.  Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot.  Ge-get outta here, PETA! We're changin' the mascot already!  Go on, get outta here. Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians... No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people. Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche.  And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich.  Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.
