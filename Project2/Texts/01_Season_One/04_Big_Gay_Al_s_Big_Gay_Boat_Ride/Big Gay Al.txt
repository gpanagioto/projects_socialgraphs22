Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al. Have you been outcast? Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us? Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here. Hi little fella, how are you doing today? I'm super, thanks for asking. Well, let's see. Come on in.  We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion. And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you! Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance? Young man, it appears you still don't understand. Come this way, I have to show you something. Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride. Step aboard, Stanley. Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time. You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan. Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my! Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely. Sooo, what do you think, Stan?  Isn't this precious? No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches? Oh Stan? When you get back to town,  tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately. Ooh, my carrot cake!  I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here. I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done. Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you.
