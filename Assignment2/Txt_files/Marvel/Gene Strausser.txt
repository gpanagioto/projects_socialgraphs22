Damage Control employees have been in the middle of a breakout at the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]], confronted [[Doctor Doom]], have been threatened with death by the [[Punisher]], and have met vastly powerful cosmic entities such as the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Galactus]]. They have "fought" side by side with the [[X-Men]], socialized with the [[New Warriors]], and were even almost menaced by the [[Hulk]].

Damage Control has appeared in various media adaptations, including the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) films ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'', and the [[Disney+]] television series ''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]'' (2022) and ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'' (2022).

==Publication history==
[[Dwayne McDuffie]], who co-created the concept with artist [[Ernie Colón]] and wrote Damage Control's initial stories, pitched ''Damage Control'' to Marvel as "a [[situation comedy|sitcom]] within the Marvel Universe".<ref>McDuffie, Dwayne. "Notes On A Series Proposal: DAMAGE CONTROL" (dated October 9, 1987)], Dwayne McDuffie's website. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080319071051/http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/Damconpitch.html  Archived at the Wayback Machine].</ref>

Damage Control employees first appear in a five-page story, "The Sales Pitch," in 1988's ''[[Marvel Age]] Annual'', and reappeared in 1989 in a serialized 7-page story published in the [[anthology]] comic ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #19.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=Damage Control |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/dcontrol.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Subsequently, the employees of Damage Control have been the subject of three four-issue [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published between 1989 and 1991: ''Damage Control'' (May - August 1989) and ''Damage Control'' vol. 2 (December 1989 - February 1990, with two issues in December), both by writer McDuffie and penciler Colón, and vol. 3 (June - September 1991) by writer McDuffie and penciler and inker [[Kyle Baker]].<ref name="Grand Comics">{{cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/series/name/Damage%20Control/sort/alpha/|title =''Damage Control''|website=[[Grand Comics Database]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=241}}</ref>

Damage Control was featured in an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #2.

Among its later appearances were those in the 2006 storyline "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]”; the series ''[[Eric O'Grady|Irredeemable Ant-Man]]''; and the first issue of ''World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control'', a three-issue limited series tying into the 2008 "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline.

==Fictional history==
Damage Control was founded by Anne Marie Hoag and was originally owned by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], each owning half the stock of the company, though Stark felt uneasy cooperating with Fisk, a notorious criminal. The company was headquartered in New York's [[Flatiron Building]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book|last1=Sanderson|first1=Peter|title=The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City|date=2007|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-3141-8|pages=34–35|edition=1st Pocket Books trade pbk}}</ref>

When Ms. Hoag was offered a job in government, she nominated Robin Chapel as her replacement. Stark and Fisk sold their stock in Damage Control: Stark because he did not want to be associated with Fisk and Fisk because he had no confidence in Robin's ability to lead the company. Another company, Carlton Co, took control of Damage Control and tried to make Damage Control more profitable, but in the process angered a lot of employees and nearly ruined Damage Control. Ms. Hoag convinced [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to invest in Damage Control and they loaned her the money to buy back the company. S.H.I.E.L.D. also found out that the sale of Damage Control had been a plot by Fisk to buy back the company for cheap. During the events of [[Acts of Vengeance]] (an event Fisk helped organize), massive damage was done to the city and Fisk made a large profit when Damage Control was hired to repair the damages.

The confrontation with the Kingpin causes unexpected results. The Damage Control staff find that a movie has been put out, a fictionalized version of their confrontation with the Kingpin. At the wrap party for the premiere, the Damage Control staff is summoned by the [[Silver Surfer]] to help deal with Edifice Rex, a former employee. He had gained cosmic powers and this, combined with an anal-retentive personality,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} threatens the cosmos. Several of the employees meet and discuss the problem with other cosmic entities, such as [[Galactus]] and Lord Chaos. Robin Chapel eventually solves this problem by firing Rex.

After a super-fight destroys the [[Washington Monument]]<ref>''X-Factor'' #74 (Jan. 1992)</ref> Damage Control is contracted and fixes the damage off-panel. Their bill is seen in a pile of paperwork.<ref>''X-Factor'' Annual #7 (1992)</ref>

[[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] is seen working with Damage Control, on one occasion serving a [[community service]] sentence levied as punishment for a drunken rampage. Hercules becomes a full-fledged employee, forced to earn a living after the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] successfully sues the demigod for injuries incurred in his apprehension.

Damage Control is seen during the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' vol. 3 #45-47 (2006)</ref> The super-villain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]], who blew up the town of Stamford, killing hundreds and starting the Civil War, reveals that a "Walter Declun" has provided him with Mutant Growth Hormone. Via Namor, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] learns Walter is the CEO of Damage Control, Inc.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #45 (Oct. 2006).</ref> A brief scene shows that Walter and one other employee of the firm are complicit in using Nitro to boost the firm's profits.

This leads Wolverine to Anne-Marie Hoag, Damage Control's President (and a brief confrontation with Ann, long-time D.C. receptionist). Anne-Marie reveals that Declun and his investors took a controlling share of the stock after the company went public to obtain more funds. D.C. has also obtained the Stamford reconstruction contract and the contract to train and evaluate registered super-beings. Anne-Marie has suspected Declun of illegal activities but did not have strong enough evidence to counter his ties with Washington D.C. and the President.

In his battle against Declun and Damage Control, which includes destroying many D.C. assets such as company equipment to robbing overseas banks with D.C. Holdings to forcing major stockholders to liquidate their stock. Wolverine later engages in a fight with a team of D.C. Security personnel who are equipped with Mandroid Armor, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weaponry, [[Iron Man|Stark Enterprises]] technology and other items salvaged from superhuman fights until the super-hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] shows up and captures Wolverine, who is then delivered to SHIELD, which is under Maria Hill's leadership. But Wolverine later escapes. After making his way back to Damage Control offices, he confronts Declun, at which point the corrupt businessman takes a dose of Mutant Growth Hormone in response to Wolverine's threats; temporally giving him super-human powers. During the fight Wolverine appears to kill Declun by stabbing him through his eye sockets. However, Declun survives the fight.<ref>''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' vol. 3 #47 (December 2006)</ref>

John Porter also becomes involved with the Civil War.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #542 (Mar. 2007).</ref> When FF members Susan and Reed Richards temporarily separate over ethical differences, their emotional split-up was punctuated by Susan using her force fields to punch a three-foot circular hole through every floor of the building. Porter then shows up and estimates the repairs will be $789,000. He also thanks Reed for the work as lately.

Damage Control creates a new division called, "Search and Rescue" that focuses on finding survivors in wreckage. They inadvertently hire [[Eric O'Grady]], thinking he is a hero called "Slaying Mantis", but he was actually looting after a [[Mighty Avengers]] battle.<ref>''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #7 (June 2007).</ref>

The company helped clean up New York City after the events of ''[[World War Hulk]]''.<ref>''World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control'' #1–3 (March 2008)</ref> [[Goliath (Tom Foster)|Tom Foster]], the nephew of the late [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] and the new Goliath, joins the company, as do fellow superhumans [[Monstro (comics)|Monstro]] and Visioneer. The undamaged [[Flatiron Building]] is once again used as their headquarters. As a company, Damage Control secures all relevant resources and a makeshift superhero rescue force, as many people were left behind when New York was evacuated for the events of 'World War Hulk'. Damage Control also collects various extraordinary resources left behind from the confrontation, such as the [[adamantium]] "bullets", an alien A.I. and alien metals.

During the reconstruction, a strange side-effect of one of the Hulk's destroyed machines causes the [[Chrysler Building]] to come to life. It wants to leave the city and see the world, but John Porter is able to negotiate a deal by which it is allowed to leave one month a year; as John notes, no one comes to Manhattan in August.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The company again gets the bid to rebuild [[Avengers Mansion]] just as a new team, led by [[Luke Cage]], is moving in. Ms. Hoag hints at a secret past with Cage.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #1 (Aug. 2010)</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Damage Control is seen working with the superheroes to clean up the destruction and chaos caused by the madness of a giant spider monster in the middle of Manhattan. Along with passing out pants to formerly spider-shaped New Yorkers, Damage set to work carting away parts of the Spider Queen's giant arachnid body. At least one Damage Control team had been infiltrated and controlled by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], a self-admitted mad scientist who wanted DNA from the spider monster.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #673 (Nov. 2011)</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Monstro finds [[List of monsters in Marvel Comics#Trull the Unhuman|Trull the Unhuman]] vandalizing Damage Control equipment and busts him. Upon Monstro empathizing him, Trull the Unhuman was convinced to give up on his goals. Trull the Unhuman joined up with Damage Control and became their spokesperson.<ref>''Civil War II: Choosing Sides'' #1 (Aug. 2016).</ref>

==Employees==
===Main characters===
* '''Anne Marie Hoag''': Founder and first director of Damage Control, an elderly lady, she is good friends with then-[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Nick Fury]] and convinced him that S.H.I.E.L.D. should loan her the money to buy Damage Control's stock. Current owner of Damage Control.
* '''[[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]''': Did community service with Damage Control before, but seen as a regular employee for Damage Control,<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' (2004) series</ref><ref>''[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]'' vol. 2 #6 (2006)</ref> after losing much of his godly riches to the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] in an excessive force lawsuit. Hercules works on construction and demolition.
* '''Robin Chapel''': Traffic manager and Ms. Hoag's most trusted employee. She initially had a rivalry with John Porter, because he was hired to fill a position for which she had applied.

Robin is very capable and ambitious, but is a friendly person underneath her businesslike exterior. Temporarily thrown out by Walter Declun's manipulations, she was recently rehired as CEO of Damage Control.
* '''Albert Cleary''': Comptroller, Albert is a financial genius and always keeps a cool head, even when presenting bills to the likes of [[Doctor Doom]]. He possesses the uncanny ability never to wrinkle his suit. Doctor Doom at one time offers Cleary a job. Cleary politely turned down the offer. Doom respected Cleary's decision enough to let him live. Although Cleary will never admit it, he found his encounter with Doom unnerving.
