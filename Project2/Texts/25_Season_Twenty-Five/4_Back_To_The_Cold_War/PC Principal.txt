Mr. Mackey, I'd like to have a word with you. I see that you've, uh, called for another nuclear emergency drill this afternoon? Well, Mr. Mackey, this is the seventh drill that we've done in two days. And I see that you also put in the budget for a bomb shelter and 20 VHS copies of "Red Dawn". Mr. Mackey, I'm starting to worry that this is sort of... nostalgic for you, like you're kind of enjoying this.  You speak Russian? Mr. Mackey, I am not asking you. I'm telling you â€“ stop with all the drills and stop putting ideas into our students' heads. Okay.
