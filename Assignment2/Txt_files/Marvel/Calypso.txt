Calypso initially appeared as a minor character ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #209 and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #65, where  she was an ally of [[Spider-Man]]'s enemy [[Kraven the Hunter]]. After Kraven's death, Calypso bewitched [[Lizard (comics)|the Lizard]] into helping her attack Spider-Man in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' Vol. 1, #1-5, then made guest appearances in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' Vol. 1, #310-311 and ''Daredevil Annual'' Vol. 1, #9. Calypso next appeared in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' Vol. 1, #109-110 and ''Spider-Man Annual'' 1997, and was killed off in a storyline that spanned ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol. 1, #249-253.

==Fictional character biography==
Calypso is a nameless [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] priestess of [[Haiti]]an nationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/calypso.html|title=Spiderfan.org}}</ref> She was a [[psychopath]]ic woman who was associated with [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Calypso seemed to enjoy driving Kraven into fits of rage and furthering his hatred of [[Spider-Man]] which ultimately led to Kraven's [[suicide]] in the "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" storyline.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Denny O'Neil|penciller = Alan Weiss|inker = Janson, McLeod, Rubinstein, Wiacek and Milgrom|colorist = Bob Sharen|letterer = Mark Rogan|editor = Allen Milgrom|story = To Salvage My Honor!|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #209|date = October 1980|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Bill Mantlo|penciller = Bob Hall|inker = Jim Mooney|colorist = Sharen|letterer = Novak|editor = Tom DeFalco|story = The Heart is a Lonely Hunter|title = Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #65|date = April 1982|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

When artist [[Todd McFarlane]] started writing the new ''Spider-Man'' comic in 1990, his opening five-issue story arc "[[Torment (comics)|Torment]]" featured Calypso as the main antagonist, whom McFarlane transformed into a dangerous threat for Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=115}}</ref> The explanation for Calypso's supernatural powers was the sacrifice of her younger sister. She used her abilities to hold [[Lizard (character)|Lizard]] in her grasp and the two nearly succeeded in murdering Spider-Man. However, the webslinger managed to beat them both and Calypso is apparently killed.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Todd McFarlane|penciller = Todd McFarlane|inker = Todd McFarlane|colorist = Bob Sharen, Todd McFarlane and Gregory Wright|letterer = Rick Parker|editor = Jim Salicrup|story = Torment|title = Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #1-5|date = August 1990 - December 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Calypso resurfaces abducting Haitian refugees, turning some into zombie slaves and selling the rest back to her homeland's government. Her actions bring her into conflict with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and his ''[[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]'' doppelganger, Hellspawn.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Alan Herdling|penciller = Scott McDaniel|inker = Bud Larosa|colorist = Max Scheele|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = Devil Ge Rouge|title = Daredevil|volume = 1|issue = #310|date = November 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Calypso briefly enthralls Daredevil, but he is able to break free of her control, and she seemingly dies yet again when the spirits of those she turned into zombies overwhelm her.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Alan Herdling|penciller = Scott McDaniel|inker = Bud La Rosa|colorist = Max Scheele|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = Soul Search|title = Daredevil|volume = 1|issue = #311|date = December 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Cheating death once more, Calypso flees to New Orleans, where her obsession with [[necromancy]] leads her to the resting place of [[Zombie (comics)|Simon Garth]], a self-aware zombie. Reviving Garth, Calypso tests his abilities and pits him against Hellspawn, though he eventually breaks free of her control and wanders off, leaving one of his Amulets of Damballah with Calypso.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Herdling|penciller = Scott McDaniel|inker = Bud LaRosa|colorist = Max Scheele|letterer = Steve Dutro|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = Resurrections|title = Daredevil Annual|volume = 1|issue = #9|date = July 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Calypso subsequently breaks into the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]] and attempts to make the incarcerated Lizard her servant again, but he resists and mauls her.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Terry Kavanagh|penciller = Alex Saviuk|inker = Stephen Baskerville|colorist = Bob Sharen|letterer = Steve Dutro|editor = Eric Fein|story = The Savaging Prelude - Death Becomes Her!|title = Web of Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #109|date = February 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Terry Kavanagh|penciller = Alex Saviuk|inker = Stephen Baskerville|colorist = Bob Sharen|letterer = Steve Dutro|editor = Eric Fein|story = The Savaging Part 1 - Final Sanction|title = Web of Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #110|date = March 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> The Amulet of Damballah, which Calypso transferred her soul into while dying, ends up in the possession of [[Glory Grant]], who Calypso possesses. Despite interference from Spider-Man, Garth, and [[Shotgun (comics)|Shotgun]], Calypso is successfully able to exhume her own corpse and revive herself with the Amulet of Damballah.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Herdling|penciller = Shawn McMannus|inker = Shawn McMannus|colorist = John Kalisz|letterer = RS/Comicraft/KS|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = Dead Men Walking|title = Spider-Man '97|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = March 1997|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Commanding a squad of savages, she later attacks Spider-Man and [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of the original Kraven the Hunter. Desiring revenge for losing Sergei, she uses her powers to drive Spider-Man and Alyosha into fighting each other. Spider-Man and Alyosha fight off her spell and shared a handshake. Alyosha says that he will hold Calypso at his mansion, so the villainess can tell him about his long-lost father. However, Alyosha kills Calypso instead.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = J.M.
