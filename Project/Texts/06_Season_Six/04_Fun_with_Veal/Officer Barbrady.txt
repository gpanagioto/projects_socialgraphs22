Hello, Mrs. Marsh. Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property. Me?? How did ''I'' get into this mess? I am. But I don't want to be. The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out. Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator. But isn't that dishonest? Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you. What do you mean?
