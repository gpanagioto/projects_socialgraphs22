'''H.E.R.B.I.E.''' ('''Humanoid Experimental Robot, B-type, Integrated Electronics''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[robot]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was initially conceived for the [[The New Fantastic Four|1978 ''Fantastic Four'' animated series]] and was integrated into the comics continuity shortly afterwards. The character is usually depicted as an ally of the [[Fantastic Four]].

==Creation and conception==
When the Fantastic Four property was made into [[The New Fantastic Four|an animated series]] in 1978, the character of the [[Human Torch]] was unable to be used as, at the time, the character had been optioned separately for use in a solo movie (which never materialized).<ref name="goodcomics.comicbookresources.com">{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/09/15/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-16/2/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #16! &#124; Comics Should Be Good! @ Comic Book Resources |publisher=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com |date=2005-09-15 |access-date=2011-04-12}}</ref>
A popular [[urban myth]] contends that the Torch was replaced due to fears that children might attempt to emulate him by setting themselves on fire, but that is not true.<ref name="goodcomics.comicbookresources.com"/>

Needing a fourth member to round out the team, [[Stan Lee]] pitched the idea for a cute robot sidekick and artist [[Dave Cockrum]] was commissioned to design it. However, Cockrum disliked the character so much he was eventually replaced by [[Jack Kirby]], who first designed and illustrated the Fantastic Four a decade prior. This was Kirby's last work for Marvel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Sean |title=Marvel Comics: The Untold Story |date=2013 |publisher=Harper Perennial |isbn=978-0061992117 |chapter=Chapter 9}}</ref>

On the Fantastic Four cartoon, H.E.R.B.I.E. was voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. Shortly after the cartoon premiered, the little robot was introduced to the comics continuity by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. As within the Marvel Universe, the Fantastic Four in the cartoon have marketed their likenesses for a successful in-universe comic series. H.E.R.B.I.E.'s physical appearance was likewise explained as being based on the animated series based on that comic, with the in-universe explanation for H.E.R.B.I.E. being on the team that the Torch was absent when the rest of the team signed the contracts granting permission for their likenesses to be used.

==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
H.E.R.B.I.E. was created by [[Mister Fantastic]] and Master Xar of the [[Xandar]]ians, who hoped that the robot could aid their search for [[Galactus]], whom they sought for aid in defeating the villain known as the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #209. Marvel Comics.</ref>

What neither of the creators realized, however, was that [[Doctor Sun]], an enemy of Master Xar who had his consciousness trapped within Xandarian computers, was able to escape by jumping from the computer to H.E.R.B.I.E.'s body. The little robot was his sleeper agent, whom he could control whenever he wished. Although an alien pirate mysteriously died in H.E.R.B.I.E.'s presence, and the villain [[Blastaar]] suddenly escaped from the [[Negative Zone]], nobody suspects that H.E.R.B.I.E. was responsible.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #215. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Sun's attempt to assassinate the Fantastic Four with Blastaar failed, Dr. Sun reveals himself at last, trapping the [[Invisible Woman]] and the [[Human Torch]] within the [[Baxter Building]]'s security system and besting Mister Fantastic and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] with H.E.R.B.I.E.'s weapons. He then abandons H.E.R.B.I.E.'s body and transfers his consciousness into the Baxter Building's main computer, which would allow him to control the entire building, and all of the weaponry within. Mister Fantastic is able to lock Dr. Sun away from the rest of the computer system, but H.E.R.B.I.E., now himself again, realizes that Dr. Sun could always simply return to his body. Not wanting the villain to cause any more trouble, the little robot heroically throws himself into the computer, destroying it, Dr. Sun, and himself.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #217. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Franklin is shown with another H.E.R.B.I.E robot, that Ben refers to as a 'flying frog'. It is explained that this one had been built partly to keep an eye on Franklin's developing powers. Said powers fluctuate due to Franklin's failure to solve a [[Rubik's Cube]] and a nearby TV show urging someone to 'grow up'. The resulting power surge destroys H.E.R.B.I.E.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #244 (July 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Other H.E.R.B.I.E. robots are eventually built throughout the years, serving general duties around the Baxter Building. In ''[[Marvel Knights]] Fantastic Four'', H.E.R.B.I.E. has served as the guardian and companion for young [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] and his sister [[Valeria Richards|Valeria]].{{issue|date=January 2011}}

A mistake leaves the Fantastic Four lost in time and other heroes running the Baxter Building. The H.E.R.B.I.E. robots take on the costumes of Doctor Doom and demand respect. Otherwise they are peaceful.<ref>''FF'' #6 (2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> They later reject this clothing and go back to normal duties. Several of the robots take to watching interesting videos online in their downtime.<ref>''FF'' #11 (2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The design of H.E.R.B.I.E. is displayed in the Smithsonian, near the Spider-Mobile.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600 (July 22, 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Reed Richards and his wife vanish following the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, much of Reed's belongings are transferred over to the heroine known as [[Moon Girl (Marvel Comics)|Moon Girl]]. H.E.R.B.I.E. activates when Galactus shows up. H.E.R.B.I.E. declares he has been a Galactus sensing device all this time. It's also revealed that in the comic book continuity, Johnny Storm did not show up to a meeting with a cartoon company, therefore H.E.R.B.I.E. replaced him in a cartoon series based on the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Moon Girl And Devil Dinosaur'' #27-28 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

H.E.R.B.I.E. is among the former Fantastic Four members that were summoned to Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman when they were threatened by the Griever at the End of All Things.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 6 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the one-shot ''[[Incoming! (comics)|Incoming!]]'', [[Valeria Von Doom]] removes H.E.R.B.I.E.'s inhibitor chip and language censor, allowing him to finally express to Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman how much he hates them.<ref>''Incoming!'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" event, H.E.R.B.I.E. appears as a member of the [[A.I. Army]].<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref> H.E.R.B.I.E. reports to the rest of the A.I. Army that Quasimodo is deactivated and Mark One is facing off against Iron Man. He runs into Awesome Android who is carrying a tablet that Machinesmith transferred his consciousness into as they flee the Baintronics guards. As Iron Man tries to reason with Mark, H.E.R.B.I.E. finds the rocket launcher that Machine Man was supposed to use and fires it on Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Awesome Android is carrying Mark One's body, H.E.R.B.I.E. states to Machinesmith that they have to flee. The three of them are contacted by Ghost in the Machine who states that they have not yet won the war and to get Mark One's body away from the battle. When Iron Man begins to descend on them, Machinesmith has Awesome Android mimic Iron Man's appearance and provide them with an escape underground. In New Jersey, Machinesmith, H.E.R.B.I.E., and Awesome Android have made use of a temporary lair as Machinesmith places his conscious into another body.

Marvel Comics.</ref> H.E.R.B.I.E., Awesome Android, and Machinesmith accompany Rescue in the raid on Baintronics. After Tony Stark gets a new body, H.E.R.B.I.E. asks how they can get up to the Stark Space Station. Tony states that he knows a way. Once that is done, H.E.R.B.I.E. is among those that confront Arno until the Extinction Entity arrives.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #5.

Though this H.E.R.B.I.E. can be high-strung and even neurotic at times it is also capable of level-headed thought and quick action in an emergency; H.E.R.B.I.E.'s efforts are often all that keep Franklin from punishment for abusing his father's equipment.
