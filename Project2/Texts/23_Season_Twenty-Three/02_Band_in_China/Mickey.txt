SHUT THE FUCK UP, THOR! You're here to flex and not speak, you fucking bitch! YOU are a fat diabetic bear, and if the Chinese don't want you, then I don't either! Now, who the fuck is Mr. Marsh?! Who is this?! I don't know you?! Are you from Pixar?! What's ''South Park''? Do I own that?! You're telling me, haha, that I'm losing Chinese customers because of some shithead that's not even from MY company?! It's like, it's like they didn't even wanna listen. It's the bear. They're still pissed off about the bear. 'Cause some Chinese people on the Internet starting posting pictures of their President as Winnie the Pooh. It's a real thing. Look it up.  Man, this is really good shit.
