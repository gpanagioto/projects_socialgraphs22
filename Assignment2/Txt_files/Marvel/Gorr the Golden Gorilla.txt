Gorr is a golden [[gorilla]] given human intelligence and greatly increased strength by the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #172</ref>

Fearing that [[Galactus]] was about to destroy his creation [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], the High Evolutionary created Gorr and sent him to Earth to seek the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref name="FF1715">''Fantastic Four'' #171-175</ref> However, when he arrived on Earth, Gorr became inexplicably mutated into a [[King Kong]]-sized monstrosity and went on a rampage through Manhattan, climbing to the top of the [[Chrysler Building]].<ref name="MCNYCGuide">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> When the Fantastic Four intervened, Gorr duped them into coming aboard his ship and transported them to Counter-Earth. The Fantastic Four, High Evolutionary, and Gorr were unable to convince Galactus not to destroy Counter-Earth, though Galactus challenged them to find a replacement within 48 hours. Gorr and the [[Human Torch]] found an Earth-like planet, which turned out to be inhabited by [[Skrull]]s. The Skrulls abandoned the planet after an altercation with Gorr, leaving the planet uninhabited and thus worthless to Galactus. Ultimately, the [[Impossible Man]] convinced Galactus to devour his own planet of Poppup instead. Gorr remained with the High Evolutionary as a "[[valet]]."<ref name="FF1715" />

Much later, Gorr became a prisoner/research project of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], held captive on his laboratory world alongside Stranger's other prisoners.<ref>''Quasar'' #14-15</ref> When the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] attacked the Stranger, he freed the Stranger's captives including Gorr who escaped.<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Gorr is a golden-colored gorilla given human-level intelligence and greatly increased strength by the [[High Evolutionary]]. Gorr also has an immunity to fire.
