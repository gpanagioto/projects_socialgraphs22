 What's that you're wearing? Whoa. Dude, no way! Dude, are these all your toys?  Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something. Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons! I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons. Yeah. It's just a dad and his son. Fine, Mom. No, my parents are. What?  Kyle? Mr. Jefferson Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning! Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow! He just showed up here. Jesus Christ! I know. He's here. No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home. Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now! Ahaa! Yeah. A ''really'' bad dream. Oh Jesus! You don't have to tell ''us'' twice, Mom. That guy's a freak! Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us. Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood. Stop, you fucking lunatic!  You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe. Blanket, you in here? All right dude, get in his bed. Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something.  Go, go, ruuun!   Oh Jesus! Oh my God, he killed Kenny! Run, Blanket, Run!
