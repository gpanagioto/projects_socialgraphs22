Check his ass! Caitlyn.  Wake up, dickhead! I'll tell you what's wrong with me! There's enemies to humanity out there wantin' to put an end to all of us, and there's assholes like you helpin' them out! Son of a bitch! In our town it all started when PC Principal arrived. He's part of a mjuch larger conspiracy, and you're his lackey. Time to take this asshole down! Why not?  Where is everybody? I thought the news said they're on a hunger strike. What the hell? If this is true, then... PC Principal's trying to help. No, click out of that. What is this? So, so then, so then Caitlyn says "Look bitch, you're married to Bill Clinton. If anyone should be afraid of AIDS, it's you." Oh God, I love you, Cait. We're so gong to win the primaries.
