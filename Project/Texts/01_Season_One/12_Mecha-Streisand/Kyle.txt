Whoa. Check it out, dude. It's got little drawings on it. I don't know. That was cool! You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now. No way, fatty, it's mine! You threw it away, fatso! Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'  You liar, Cartman! I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it. What would we use a marble sack for? I didn't steal ''anything''. Good! Whoa! No. Aagh! Stop that! Yyeeaahh. ''You'' threw it away, Cartman! Yeah. How'd you know? Triangle of ''Zin''thar? AAAAAA! Cartman? What the hell are you doing?! Well, Ike. ''You'' can tell Cartman that it's ''my'' triangle! Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, ''take'' the stupid triangle! If it'll make you leave me alone, then just ''take'' the damned thing! Here! There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel ''really, really good'' about yourself! Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would ''shut... up''. ''Your'' triangle? Oh, just this ''really really'' old lady who wishes she was still only 45. Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strangers? Hey! Don't try to pass it back on ''me'', fat-ass! Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home! Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks? Whoa, that was cool! You bastard! The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now. No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr! Disintegration is the best album everrr! We've ''got'' to get rid of them. Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! Well, that whole experience sure did suck. But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
