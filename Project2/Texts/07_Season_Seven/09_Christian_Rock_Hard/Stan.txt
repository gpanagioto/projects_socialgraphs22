Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band.  Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented.  See what? I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band! Hey dude. No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet! You got a computer? See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer! Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too. What the hell is that?  We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again! Boy, I'll say!  Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice. Oh yeah. It is??  Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity. What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.  Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.  Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy! I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band. What?? Is this for real?? This is for real!  So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman? Are you- gonna pay 'im? I thought albums win either gold or platinum. Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.
