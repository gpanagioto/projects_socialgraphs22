Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day! Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies? We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.  They see through the charade. I think they see through the charade, yes. Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up!  Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years, gaming was simple: you pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps, we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you ''pay'' for incentives, you're rewarded! It's a simple cycle, a never-ending loop based on RPGs: Explore -> Collect -> Spend -> Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money. And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles: entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-  -and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money. No no! It has to be just ''barely'' fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun.  Ehhhveryone is doing it. It's the way things are going! Oh. Ah what is the matter? Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that!  Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in "moderation"? Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time! Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game. Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games ''really'' work.  The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents. Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke. Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers. We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're COUNTING on it!! It's the same with us, but we've got our eyes on every addict's screen! Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats! Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil.
