 The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs. I have to leave soon, Eric. Come down as soon as you're done.  Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly. All those other babysitters won't come back. Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears. Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.  Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay? Be good. Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses!  Eskimo kisses for Mom-my! Bye, kids.  No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors. This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up. Not really, hon.  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!  Hi, kids. I'm home.
