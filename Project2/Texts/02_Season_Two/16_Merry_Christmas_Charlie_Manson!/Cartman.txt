 Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a big present, for no reason, except that I'm cool. Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.  Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?  Argh!  We don't care, Mom. Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap. How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me. Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to ''get a god-damned present?!'' ''Over the meadow and through the woods...''  Hi, Grandpa! Sweet. What is it? Yes! Move it!   I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech. Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?   Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home! I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!  Hi, cousin Elvin. Yup! Amen.  Bad Jimmy! Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Ow! What the hell was ''that'' for! Ow! Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap! Uncle Howard! Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?! Wow, cool! Okay. Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.  What?  All right, keeps your pants on.  Can somebody drive us to the mall?  Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?  Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall? Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!  Damn his Goddamned authorituh! I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin! All right. Give me $10.   My family sucks ass! Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns.  My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us. Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people.  How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff.  And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall! So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time? Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin.   I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap! Oh, uh that's pretty cool.  Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?! Lock the door!  See ya, Uncle Howard.  Piece of crap.
