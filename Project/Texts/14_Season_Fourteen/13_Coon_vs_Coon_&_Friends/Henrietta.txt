Go away Mom, I hate you. Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here! Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them.  It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension. Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world. The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal.  Get out of my room, TWERP!
