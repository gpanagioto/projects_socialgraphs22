Your vice principal gave birth to all five babies with no epidural. I must say, she's a very strong woman. The quintuplets are all healthy and resting away.  There are her babies, right there. Yes, cute little buggers, aren't they? Three boys and two girls. Funny. That's exactly what their mother said.  The quints are all Caucasian, blue-eyed, and something kind of weird. Well, the babies are all extremely PC, the likes of which I have never seen. Watch this.  Oh I'm sorry. That's only for the mother and father. Though, according tot he vice principal, the father doesn't even exist.
