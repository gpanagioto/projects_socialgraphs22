Father, can I talk to you? Well, what's troubling you?  You know, at school the kids used to all make fun of me sometimes. One kid would say something mean, a-and then the other kids would laugh. I know how lousy it feels. I learned to just walk away, not give 'em all the satisfaction. I know it seems impossible. I thought I'd be a punching bag my whole life, but now, I'm one of the popular kids. I even get invited to board game night at Stan's house. My point is, sometimes, y-you just gotta put yourself out there.  So, Kyle, did you know Father is a really good singer? You like to sing too, don't you? Aw, Father, wait a- Father!  Come on, Father, you can't give up so fast. Who cares? Who cares what people say? Aw, come on, you gotta be strong! Because I was you. Okay? I wasn't always this cool. I've been through it. But then one day, somebody told me something. He said "life is full of love and light and bountiful things," and you know who told me that? You did! Two years ago, in church! You have a right to go and be happy! And if people wanna keep tryin' to knock you down, well, fuck 'em! There's no church today! You all are just gonna have to find some'n' better to do!  Isn't this great, Father? Fresh mountain air, a nice warm fire, a nice warm fire. Yeah, the Lord is pretty cool. Happy birthday, Clyde!  Hope you don't mind I brought a friend. That's it! You're doing great! Nobody's staring. I'm gonna get us some soda pop. You just mingle with the other fellas! Wow! Sure, Kyle. Be right back, Father.  Huh-what's up? What are you saying, Kyle? Well, of course, you don't. Well I'm sorry for tryin' to help out somebody who didn't have anywhere else to turn. We'll both just leave. I thought you were better than that, Kyle.  Father! Father? Has anybody seen my priest? Father, where'd you go?  There you are! I've been looking everywhere. But you're missin' the party!  But, they just don't understand you like I do. But it's not your fault. Why?! But... I thought we were pals. Sometimes I wonder. ...No thanks. No.  Stan? Father. What?? No! No. He can't. Father, you did it! Does that mean you're gonna stay?
