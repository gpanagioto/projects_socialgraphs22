All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.  Get out of here! No, Kyle's right, you guys. We ''should'' do something. Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do. Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready? All right, here we go! Jimmy?   Yes! There's a bunch outside my house too. No! Fuck off!  Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible! You what?!  Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle! You see what you did, Kyle?! They're everywhere!  Aw man, it ''really'' smells like Kenny's house down here. Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together. All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof. I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people. I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty. Cool. Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny. Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town. Youu heard about that? Thirty was hard enough. Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town. Let's hope to Christ this works.   <poem><i>California<br />Supercool to the homeless</i></poem> <poem><i>Californiania<br />Na na orn nea</i></poem>
