I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much. You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough. I'll pay you back for it, okay?! I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ! Ohhh hey guys. Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best. Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do? Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto.  You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play? It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out. It's just... Yeah, it's fun. Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it. ...Free?  I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up. One? No, no, it's not. I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer! Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand. It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse. How? I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way?  Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them. Okay. So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me? So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything? The addict people said something about me filling a hole. Yeah, no, this is great. I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there? That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications.  Ah, Canada? ...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!  Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay.  I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie. We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps. That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking. Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies.
