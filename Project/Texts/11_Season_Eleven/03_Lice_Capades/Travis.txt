Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our baby is gonna grow up in.   The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.  If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it. If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen! I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.  Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all! Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our baby. I want to name her... Hope. Hope for a... chance at tomorrow?  Oh my God.  We have to get out of here! We have to get out of here now, Kelly!  Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly!  Don't look, Kelly! Don't look! I don't think so!  Kelly! Hang on! You have to! For the baby!  Kellllllyyyyy! No! Noooo!  Hope. Hope, you're alive.  Heh?! How many survivors?  You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!   This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet. First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even ''see'' another planet! We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?! Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times! You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my baby.  Not a chance. If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you.  It's real. Real as my love for my unborn baby. Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it. Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  Kelly. Luck had nothin' to do with it.  Why you murdering bastard! What the hell do you want, Vice President?! What are you going to do? Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead! Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my baby! Damn you! Why?! ''Kelly. Kelly, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our baby. But I let you down, babe. [blinks. A light shines on him and a vision of Kelly descends. Travis holds his left hand up as a visor to make sure he's not hallucinating]'' Keh... k-Kelly?  Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kelly!
