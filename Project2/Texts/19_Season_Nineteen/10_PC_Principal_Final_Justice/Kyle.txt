Butters.  Jimmy's dead. I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away. PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology. Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe. It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired. I think it's obvious. Stan's dad. Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in. There's no way to know who we can trust. There's only one thing we can do.  We have to get guns. It's the only way for us to be safe. You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected. Are you okay? Here.  Don't worry, Leslie. I won't let anything happen to you.  Leslie, we don't know who is on their side. We have to stay safe. I...  gave up giving speeches. I'm sure I'd have no problem giving a speech if you could be by my side. Not if we go somewhere that's completely safe from any violence. The gun show. There'll be so many guns that nothing bad can happen.  You son of a bitch Stan! How could you have sided with the enemy?! Jimmy? You told me Jimmy was dead.
