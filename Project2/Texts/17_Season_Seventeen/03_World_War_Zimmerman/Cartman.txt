Hey Tolkien!  What's up, bro? "Nothin'" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you? Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'? Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Tolkien. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  Dude, um, what are doing after school, Tolkien? You wanna, you wanna hang out?  God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Yeah, I feel great. Why?  Mister!  It's Tolkien. I think he's a ticking time bomb. He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget. But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault! No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse. M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay. M'kay. No, Tolkien! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Tolkien, Tolkien! Hey Tolkien? How are you doing? That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  No! My wife, Tolkien! Tolkien, that's my wife! No Tolkien! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO!  Agreed. Hoh boy, here we go.  Tolkien, I wasn't on that jury. Okay? This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me. Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here. It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now. <poem><i>Black people say He-ey! </i></poem> <poem><i>Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"</i></poem> Tolkien, calm down. Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now!  Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!   Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow! Get to an airport! We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!!  The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now!  The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us! You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to!  Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland.  Everyone quiet! I have to think! I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet.  Nah!   One of them is in the back! Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time! It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet. His name is Tolkien. I won't do it! He used to be my friend!  Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world. We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!  Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance. A person.  Threatening ''all'' of us! What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?! Stand my ground? Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida? The other way to stop the outbreak. Tolkien isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen ''if''... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida! Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go! If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman. Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out.  I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way. Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black. Hey Tolkien. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now. Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry. Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Tolkien. Alright Tolkien, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible. Yeah. So bad. Jury found me innocent, Kyle! You interrupt people when they talk. Oh man!  Oh boy. Yeah Tolkien, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava. Tolkien, calm down. Oh God, here we go again!
