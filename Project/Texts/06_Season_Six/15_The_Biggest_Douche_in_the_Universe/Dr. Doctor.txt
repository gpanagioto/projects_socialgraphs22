 Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too. I'm afraid he's... running out of time. It's his time. It's ...running out. He needs to have more time. Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist.  Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something.  Let's not validate his delusions. What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant! I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored.
