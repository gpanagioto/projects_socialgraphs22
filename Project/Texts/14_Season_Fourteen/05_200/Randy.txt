You just had to push it, didn't you, Stan? You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again! Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks! Mr. Cruise, my son is so, so sorry, and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments. Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box...  We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages... Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer again.  ANYTHING! Anything you want, Mr. Cruise. Sure! Who is it? We can get anybody for you. That's... tricky... Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we- Okay, people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park. Alright, Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I've done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today.  Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad. Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo. Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, not even showing his eyes?   Aw. Aw, it's just a stupid threat! Come on, we don't wanna piss off Tom Cruise again.  What the hell was that?! Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved.  Helllo? Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you. There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they're gonna bomb us. Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise. Well, yeah.
