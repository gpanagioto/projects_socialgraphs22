Buenos días, niños. Me llamo Jefe.  Tu familia no está aquí, Es triste. Tu kri. Tu kri.  Aquí es mervilosa! Divértida!  Papél de aluminió, por favor.  Broflovski - is, is that an El Salvadorean name?  Yeah! But... Doesn't Mexican Joker understand that we're just doing our job and making America great? Well, what would Mexican Joker- I don't wanna be part of a bad guy flashback scene. Maybe we should get kids out of here. What are you saying? Hi, Princess Star. Boooo! Hola niños, me llamo Jefe...  Oh, hey Jeff. Rodgers read an article about how electroshock therapy can help people who've gone through traumatic experiences. We figured some treatments could help Mexican Joker deal with his trauma. To hell with the costs, Jeff! If Mexican Joker doesn't have flashbacks, then he doesn't grow up to be a monster!  Oh God! I don't know which way is up anymore! This is the flashback?! Jeff, you know what this means? Now we'll have to let them all go! This is how Mexican Joker breaks free!
