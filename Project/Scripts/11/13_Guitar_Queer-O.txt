Stan's house, day. In the living room, Stan and Kyle stand before the TV with guitar controllers in their hands. Nine boys from class watch them from the sofa and the floor. A game starts up. Stan and Kyle immediately begin to play and the other boys begin to cheer them on. The song playing is "Wayward Son"

Cartman

Stan, you guys are good! [Stan and Kyle more their right arms around during a power chord, then quickly return to playing. The score is 15,594 points and climbs quickly. Randy watches from the kitchen doorway]

+++++


The kitchen. Sharon is washing dishes. Randy turns and walks towards her.

Randy

[sounding tired] Sharon, what are the boys doing?

Sharon

Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.

Randy

They can play guitar now?

Sharon

No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the gameplay.

Randy

Ohhh.

Sharon

If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.

Randy

Hey yeah...

+++++


The living room. The round ends and the boys cheer.

Stan

Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! [a shot of the cheering CG crowd on the TV]

Randy

[walks up to Stan] So you boys like this music, huh?

Kyle

Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.

Butters

Stan and Kyle are really good at it.

Randy

Well, you kids wanna see something really cool? [the boys pay attention] Check this out. [walks away and picks up an electric guitar, and plugs in the amplifier. He puts his right foot on top of the amplifier and begins to play "Wayward Son" a half-step up.]

Once, I rose above the noise and confusion,
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higherr,
But I flew too highh
Though my eyes, could see, I-




Stan

[irritated, interrupting] Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!

Randy

[brightly] I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?

Cartman

Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.

Stan

Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.

Randy

But... But this is real.

Cartman

Real guitars are for old people.

Craig

Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. [Randy stands there a few seconds, disappointed that the boys aren't interested. He takes off the guitar, leans it against the amplifier, and walks away.]

Stan

[turns back to the TV] Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. [the game starts up with a new song, and the boys behind them begin to cheer again]

+++++


Stan's house, night. Once everyone's asleep, Randy sneaks downstairs towards the couch. He looks around to make sure no one else is awake and waiting for him. He reaches the couch and picks up a controller, playing it a bit to start the game.

M.C.

Are you ready to rock? ["Wayward Son" begins to play from the top, and Randy begins to move, slowly raising his right hand into a victory sign, then swinging his arm all the way around a few times]

Kansas



Carry on my wayward, son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more


[the first guitar solo follows and Randy is playing terribly. The video crowd begins to boo him.]


M.C.

Game over! You suck! [the words are displayed onscreen. Randy takes off the controller, sets it on the ground, and walks back to bed, leaving the TV on with the video crowd still booing him.]

+++++


Stan's house, next day. The boys are back at Stan's house watching another round of Guitar Hero. "Wayward Son" gives way to another song.

Butters

They're gonna do it!

Cartman

[so relaxed his fat blocks his chin from view] Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!

Kyle

Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. [the points pile up and they near 100,000. After a final flourish, their readouts combine into one, showing 100,000 points. The boys congratulate Stan and Kyle]

M.C

You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!

Stan

Dude, we are total rock stars now!

Randy

[walks in with beer and slurred speech] You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! [the doorbell rings]

Stan

[takes off his controller and goes to answer the door] Hang on.

Man

Stan Marsh?

Stan

Yeah?

Man

I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.

Stan

Yeah, we did. [smiles]

Mr. Kincade

Well, I'm impressed. [steps inside and gives him a business card] And I'd like to be your manager.

Stan

Wow, really?? [smiles an open smile] Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!

Randy

No way!

Kyle

For reals? [smiles]

Mr. Kincade

Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.

Stan

That'd be awesome!

Mr. Kincade

So, we're in business then? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then grin as "Wayward Son" plays]

+++++


A producer's office, day. Mr. Kincade is snapping his fingers to "Wayward Son" as a producer listens. Stan and Kyle watch him, then Stan looks at Kyle. Kyle grimaces.

Mr. Kincade

Well, what do you think?

Producer

I like it. That's these boys playing?

Mr. Kincade

[stops the tape] No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.

Producer

That's pretty Goddamned impressive. [rises and serves himself a drink] Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. [Stan and Kyle smile to this news as Mr. Kincade stands behind them]

Mr. Kincade

[pumps his fist] Yes! You did it, boys.

Producer

Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?

Stan, Kyle

Cool! [smile openly]

+++++


The producer's mansion, night. Limos pull into the circular driveway in front of the mansion, drop off guests, and pull away. Inside is a large crowd of local celebrities. In the pool, two topless women splash each other with water and giggle. One blond celebrity is snorting a mountain of coke

Stan

Wow, this is a huge party.

Producer

Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.

Stan

Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! [Ron Zappolo is shown - an elderly gent with gray hair and mustache]

Kyle

Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. [Jabs is shown with a white tiger on his lap and two women around him]

Producer

Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero. [ooo's and applause follow. Stan and Kyle grin] Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.

Stan

Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there! [a football player wearing #6 is shown] Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!

Kyle

Oh my God!

Producer

Would you boys like to meet him?

Stan

Are you serious??

Producer

Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.

Jay

Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.

Stan

Nice to meet you! [grins] I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.

Jay

[a bit bothered] Thanks...

Guest

Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?

Producer

You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?

Kyle

Do we? He's a legend!

Producer

You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.

Tom Shane

That, would be impressive.

Kyle

[takes Stan aside] Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.

Stan

Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.

+++++


Stan's house, day. Mr. Kincade rocks out on the couch watching Stan and Kyle play Guitar Hero. The boys hit 152,626 points

M.C.

You Rock!

Mr. Kincade

[clapping] All right, nice rehearsal, boys.

Kyle

D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?

Stan

Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.

Mr. Kincade

That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. [an assistant dressed in a jogging outfit joins him behind Kyle]

Kyle

Oh, okay. Cool. [takes off his controller and follows Jim out]

Mr. Kincade

[sighs] You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.

Stan

Really? That'd be sweet.

Mr. Kincade

[turns around and points to Stan] I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back.

Stan

What, you mean, Kyle?

Mr. Kincade

Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.

Stan

But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.

Mr. Kincade

[crosses his arms] Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowhere. Just listen to that video crowd. [a shot of the video crowd cheering] I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings.

+++++


Caf√© Monet, day. Mr. Kincade and Stan are outside at a table sipping coffee.

Mr. Kincade

You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course. [sees someone] Ah, Thad! [a boy about Stan's age approaches the table and takes a seat. He wears a controller on his back] Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.

Thad

Sup? [an air of superiority is suggested by his tilting his head back]

Mr. Kincade

That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? [puffs on a cigar]

Thad

Yup.

Mr. Kincade

He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.

Stan

Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?

Mr. Kincade

Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do. [Thad stands on his chair, swings his controller around, and puts his right foot on the table.] Check this out. [All that is heard are the clicks of plastic on plastic] Pretty damn good, huh?

Stan

Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? [Thad stops and launches into that song]

Mr. Kincade

Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.

Male Diner

Ohoh, I love this song. [the other diners seem to understand the song the clicks are supposed to be making and begin to clap]

+++++


Stan's house, later. Guitar Hero starts up and the boys are gathered near the couch watching Stan and... Thad. A song comes on and Stan and Thad begin to play. The boys cheer them on as the score nears 500,000

Butters

Wow wee, look at him go!

Kyle

[enters the house] Hey dude, how's it-? [he has his new controller, but he's dismayed at what he sees. The boys look at him and the game is shut off]

Stan

...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.

Butters

[into his hands, in a low hoarse voice.] Uh ohhh...

Kyle

[walks up to Stan] Who is this?

Stan

This is um, Thad Jarvis.

Thad

Sup?

Kyle

Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?

Stan

Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincade thinks I should play with Thad for a while.

Kyle

But it's our game. We bought it together.

Stan

I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.

Kyle

Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!

Stan

Don't put this all on me, Kyle!

Cartman

Oh my God this is so awesome.

Stan

You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-

Kyle

I have been sick!

Stan

Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!

Kyle

[stunned for a few seconds] I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. [drops his controller next to Stan and walks out of the house, closing the door behind him]

Craig

Dude, this game rules.

Stan

Let's just do this, all right? [a new round begins and Stan and Thad resume playing]

+++++


EV Games. Guitar Hero advertising is plastered all over the windows. Stan enters the store. He walks over to the magazine rack and begins browsing

Brett

Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?

Stan

It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.

Brett

Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.

Stan

[approaches the counter with a Guitar Hero game guide] Huh?

Brett

Have you ever heard of... [pulls out a different game from under the counter] Heroin Hero?

Stan

Hero-Heroin Hero?

Brett

It's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.

Stan

And there's no score? No crowds?

Brett

[his voice gets soft and mellow as he speaks] No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.

+++++


Stan's house, day. He's playing Heroin Hero, which just consists of his character shooting heroin into his right arm. Each shot moves him forward a few steps, but he's no closer to the dragon.

The Dragon

Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.

Stan

[playing quietly] Dude, this is awesome.

+++++


Gamecraft Arcade, day. Stan and Thad are at the arcade version of Guitar Hero; Stan is showing frustration. The song they're playing to is "I Wanna Be Sedated". Mr. Kincade watches them as the producer approaches

Producer

How are they coming?

Mr. Kincade

No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days

Mr. Hart

They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. [walks away. On the game screen, Stan's character is missing his notes and flailing about]

Stan

Ugh. Damnit.

Thad

Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?

Stan

[frustrated] Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play! [misses some more notes] No no, you know what?! Screw this! [the music stops] I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!

Mr. Kincade

Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.

Stan

Yeah? Well, I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!

Thad

No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.

Stan

Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!

Mr. Kincade

Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?

Stan

We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!

Thad

Yeah? Well, how about this one? I quit. [drops his controller] I quit, I quit, I quit. [turns around and walks away] I quit, I quit, I quit. I quit, I quit, I quit.

Stan

You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!

Mr. Kincade

Stan, what is the matter with you?

Stan

I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! [Mr. Kincaid notices that Stan's tote bag is open and looks inside. He pulls out Heroin Hero]

Mr. Kincade

What is this?

Stan

Man...

Mr. Kincade

Are you playing Heroin Hero?

Stan

Just, just a little.

Mr. Kincade

No! [stands up] Nobody plays Heroin Hero "a little"! You know, you never catch the dragon!

Stan

I know, but it mellows me out, okay?!

Mr. Kincade

You'd better pull your act together because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!

Stan

No problem.

+++++


A bowling alley, day. The exterior is a bit run-down, with strips of plastic pulling away from the roof. A sign by the street has "WE HAVE GUITAR HERO" on it, the R falling off. "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" plays. Inside, some people are bowling while others sit at tables being depressed. The camera rests on Kyle playing along on his guitar controller. Two kids walk up to Kyle. The place is called Mick's Lanes

Older Boy

Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!

Kyle

I'm not done yet.

Younger Boy

Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?

Kyle

No. You're thinking of somebody else.

Younger Boy

Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points!

Older Boy

How come you're playing here now?

Kyle

Look, just go ahead and play, alright? [gets off the stool and walks away] Leave me alone. [walks up to the bar and takes a seat] Can I get a Fresca, please?

Mick

You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.

Kyle

Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.

Mick

Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little, and... maybe you can play it for free.

Kyle

I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.

Mick

Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.

Kyle

Thanks, Mick.

+++++


Heroin Hero, onscreen at Stan's house, day.

The Dragon

Catch me. Come on, catch me. [Stan is passed out on the couch with snacks all around him. Some knocks and the doorbell are heard, but Stan doesn't move] What's wrong? Follow me. Come on. [The door opens and Mr. Kincade comes in]

Mr. Kincade

Marsh? Stan, you got- [notices Stan passed out] Oh my God! [runs over to him and shakes him hard] Get up, Stan! Wake up!

Stan

Huh? What, uh?

Mr. Kincade

You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!

Stan

The dragon. Where did it go?

Mr. Kincade

[slaps Stan twice across the face] You've gotta pull it together! [shakes him hard again, then sees a glass of water nearby and throws the water at him, them shakes him hard again] Pull it together, Goddammit!

+++++


Gamecraft Arcade, night. The boys are there waiting for Stan to start playing. A couple stands behind them waiting as well.

Mr. Kincade

Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom. [the boys cheer Stan on.]

Tolkien

Go Stan!

Cartman

All right, Stan, you've got it, man!

Tolkien

Yeah, Stan!

Craig

Dude, what's the matter with him?

Butters

He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero. [Stan staggers slowly] Come on, Stan! You got it!

Mr. Kincade

Goddamnit, he's a mess! [Stan is moving around, but he's missing all the notes]

Craig

Oh man, I can't watch this.

Mr. Kincade

What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! [a shot of the video crowd booing]

Cartman

Come on guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys leave, as to the couples and other spectators, leaving Stan alone with Mr. Kincade. Mr. Hart approaches Mr. Kincade.]

Mr. Hart

The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed. [walks away. Stan stumbles and finally falls face first, throwing up]

Mr. Kincade

You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! [walks away. More shots of the video crowd booing. Stan looks at the crowd and begins seeing double]

+++++


EV Games, day. Brett the clerk is reading a magazine. Stan walks in, his head hanging real low, and walks to a game stand

Brett

There he is! So, did you break a million yet?

Stan

No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!

Brett

Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.

Stan

I just wanna find something else to play.

Brett

Have you played... [whips out a new game] Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it.

Stan

I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?

Brett

Sssure kid. Sure. [brings out a Cross Country Cruiser game]

+++++


Stan's house, day. He's now playing Cross Country Cruiser. A radio is next to him, and in it, a song ends.

Radio Host

All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth-grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero. [Stan is startled] Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I guess... they're not playing the game anymore.

+++++


"Wayward Son" begins to play and Stan gets immersed in the game. A shot of Stan and Kyle playing Guitar Hero floats by.

Kansas



Carry on my wayward, son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion,
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher,
But I flew too high

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man,
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man,
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming,
I can hear them say...



+++++


Stan then steps on the brake, stopping his video car. He thinks hard about what to do next. After a few seconds, a look of determination shows up and he goes into reverse, looking back over his shoulder as if he were driving a real car.

+++++


Mick's Bowling Lanes, day. The sign now says: KILE BARFFLOSKI ON GUITAR HERO. Inside, Kyle is at the Guitar Hero setup playing along to another song.

Skid Row



Woke up to the sound of pouring rain,
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name,
And when you needed me I came through...


[Stan walks in and approaches Kyle. Kyle sees him and turns his back to him]


Stan

Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?

Kyle

What are you doing here? ["I paint a picture of the days gone by,"]

Stan

Please, it- it won't take long.

Kyle

Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. ["When love went blind and you would make me see." Kyle walks over to the bar and serves himself some Fresca]

Stan

I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. ["I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes"]

Kyle

Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! ["So that I knew you were there for me"]

Stan

Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.

Kyle

Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! ["Time after time you were there for me"]

Stan

That isn't it at all. ["Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand"]

Kyle

You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! ["Love letters in the sand - I remember you..."]

Stan

I know. I need you. [Kyle glances over his shoulder, then turns around to face Stan] I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that... [turns around and face Kyle] ...with my best friend.

Kyle

It was pretty fun, wasn't it?

Stan

[awkwardly] Yeah.

Kyle

Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.

Stan

I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.

Kyle

I don't really see the fun in... [turns around with fire in his eyes] ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!

Stan

What, you mean it?

Kyle

I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.

Stan

[pats Kyle on the shoulder] Then let's go, dude! [walks forward. Kyle follows.]

Kyle

[stops abruptly] Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here. [turns around and face Mick] Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?

Mick

Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?

Kyle

Thanks, Mick! [turns left and walks out. Stan follows him.]

+++++


Stan's house, day. Stan and Kyle walk up to Stan's house. Stan opens the door and they enter the living room

Stan

All right, dude, let's do this. [Kyle's jaw drops and Stan is annoyed] What the hell? [what greets them is Randy on the couch in his underwear. Around him are a pizza slice, a bucket of chicken, a case of S'mores Schnapps, and other items. Randy is playing Heroin Hero]

Randy

Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh...

The Dragon

Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on.

Stan

Aw, Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!

Randy

Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.

The Dragon

Hehe, you almost caught me.

Stan

No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!

Randy

[sits up] I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?

Stan

You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! [turns off the console]

Randy

NOO! NOOO, I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!

Stan

Mom, will you get Dad out of here?

+++++


The neighborhood park. Cartman, Kenny, Clyde, Craig, and Tolkien are playing basketball. Craig has the ball and shoots at the basket. The shot is good.

Cartman

Stop cheating, Craig! [pushes Craig from behind]

Craig

How was that cheating!

Cartman

'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!

Butters

Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!

Cartman

What?

Butters

Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! [Butters runs back. After some thought, the other boys run after him]

The Boys

Oh, let's go! Come on, let's go!

+++++


Stan's house, day. Stan and Kyle are playing again. Kevin, Jimmy, and a third boy are already present. The other boys enter and jimmy makes room for them to see the action

Butters

They're gonna do it! [they finally break the million]

Craig

They did it!

Jimmy

Oh my sweet J-Jesus!

M.C.

You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach one million points! Congratulations! You. Are. FAGS. [the video crowd cheers]

Stan

That's it?

Kyle

Goddamnit... Goddamnit. [walks away pissed off. Stan takes off his controller and looks at it, drops it to the floor, and follows after Kyle]

Cartman

Butters, you wanna play me next? [picks up Stan's controller and puts it on]

Butters

Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. [picks up Kyle's controller and puts it on, and both of them get to playing.]

+++++
