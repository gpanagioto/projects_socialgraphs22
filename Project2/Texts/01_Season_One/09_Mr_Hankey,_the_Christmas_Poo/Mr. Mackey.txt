Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia. Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle. Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle? So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya? And that must make you mad. Mad enough to ''kill'', Kyle??? Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay? Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have. Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand? To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac... Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey! No! Get away from me! No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?
