Howdy, folks. Aaaarargargar! You know, Tom, I think something like this was bound to happen. There's those at the top who control the means of production, and then there's the working class that enables those means by selling their labor power for wages. When there's conflict, the ruling class tries to blame the working class. No, my organs have been compacted, so if the box opens, I spill out and die. I believe the working class needs to revolt against capitalism and bring about socioeconomic emancipation. At what cost, sir?! Do you care that personal worth is being reduced by capitalists to exchange value?! Free trade is not free-dom! Perhaps socialism IS the answer! The history of this world... is the history of class struggles. Alienated from the products of their labor... from their fellow laborers and from their very essence. The oppressed worker will eventually strike back at those capitalists who control the means of production. We have nothing to lose but our chains. We will unite in revolution.  Nothing else can be allowed into the fulfillment center, no matter what the cost. Then follow me to Hell.
