What the hell do you think you're doing?! I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut! "Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end". "Or does she?" Hey hey, stop reading that! Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about! Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now? Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president. What?! Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
