Well, hi, junior! What a surprise, m'kay! Well, sure, come on in! Everything is still just as you left it, son. Oh, uh, m'kay, honey, I'll make you a snack. Here's your Sunny Delight and Steak-umms, honey. Sweetheart...are you m'kay? Honey...as your mother, I want you to know you can talk to me about whatever you want. Even if it's about being scared of gettin' old.  Ooh, junior. I know that gettin' old isn't so much fun, is it? We all wanna go back to a time when we were younger. You're getting to be around 55. Your pee-pee doesn't work so good, does it? Well, I'm your mom, honey. When a man gets to a point where his pee-pee doesn't work the way it used to, he starts to...well, sit in his room and play war games again, you know? But honey, those times weren't better. We were all scared. People died. That's not something to strive to get back to. Oh, you're not bad— No, no, sweetheart. It-it just felt good ‘cause it was familiar. That's just sort of what us old people do.
