Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him! This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place! Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options! I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have. Go ahead and tell him, Cartman. Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers. Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there. Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.  I swear, Stan.  Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan! Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!  What the hell did you do?? No. Tell me you didn't! Thanks, Mrs. Marsh. Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan? Stan, it's me. Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us. You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair. You didn't? I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.  Stan, don't say that.  I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans! I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation! The fight is over, Cartman! Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here? No. They're not a part of your betrayal? Stan? Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
