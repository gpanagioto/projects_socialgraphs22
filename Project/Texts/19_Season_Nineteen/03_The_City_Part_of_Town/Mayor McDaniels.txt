I've called you all here because South Park has an image problem. Thanks to Mr. Garrison we are now being referred to as the shit-heads of America. One of our more politically sensitive citizens has proposed an idea for this crisis and I'd like you to hear him out. I'm announcing a plan for SoDoSoPa.  A new urban development that will turn the most rundown and dilapidated part of our town into a quaint center of artisan shops and cafes. So you think you'll keep all the existing structures? And we want to assure the lower-income families that we are going to take the time to do this right. This is it, people! This is what we've all been working for! The future of our town depends on us being on our best behavior! No swearing, no weirdness, and no speeches!  Go! go! Everyone in place!   Hello, sir. On behalf of everyone here in South Park, please let me say we are very excited to be in consideration- The previous principal of the school was let go so that someone more progressive could take over. This is our new fourth-grade teacher. She's very normal and professional. Oh no, that's just where they always sit, next to our beloved Craig there, who is a homosexual.  Uh, can, can I show you the most exciting part of town? This is historic SoDoSoPa. It's our vibrant and charming arts and foods district.  That's really what our town is about.  Oh yes, of course, uh... I believe they are. Rancher, could you make sure?
