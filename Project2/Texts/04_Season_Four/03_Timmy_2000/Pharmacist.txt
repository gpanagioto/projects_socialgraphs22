There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin. We can only hope so. Next?  Next, please?  What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin! Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all. Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected. Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points. Can I help you? Eh wuh, what??  Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God!  Yes, of course. I have some right here.  It's a compound called "Ritalout."
