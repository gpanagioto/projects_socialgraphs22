What is this? It's horrible! What did he say? Whatwhatwhaaat?!!? Oh really? Is that so? And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny. Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor... These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up! We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children! We want more quality television, like ''Full House''. It'll work, it has to. Hey, you will not get away with this! That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'. Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool? The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready? Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch! We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes. Here Carol, I think it's your boy. At last, now we can return to normality. Here they are! But look what they put on. What did he say? Whatwhatwhaaat!!! Come on everybody, back to New York!
