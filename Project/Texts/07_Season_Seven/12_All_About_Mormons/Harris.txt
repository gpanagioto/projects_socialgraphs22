A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book. Why would he make it up? Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem.   Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.  He is?? Wow! If God got angry with you, then you ''must'' be tellin' the truth. All right, Martin. Let's get to work!
