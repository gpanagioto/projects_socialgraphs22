  Did you go yet? What's he want? Goddamnit Cartman, what?!  That isn't funny, Cartman. ...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son. No way!  Cartman, where are you going??  Oh boy. Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town. Yeah, you missed them turning around. What? Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's. How the hell should ''we'' know?  There's these two people with asses where their heads should be. But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical! Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head? Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!  Hey, you're laughing, Cartman. Huh? Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.  Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them. Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
