A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination.  Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on. The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them. Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination? Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.  A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination!
