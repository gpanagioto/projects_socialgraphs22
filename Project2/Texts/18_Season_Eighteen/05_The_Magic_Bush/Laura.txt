But now, because I "choose" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be, I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster! I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural! I haven't been "humiliated", I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?! I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop? Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird! They didn't!
