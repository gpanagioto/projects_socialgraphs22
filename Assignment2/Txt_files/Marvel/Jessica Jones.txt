'''Jessica Campbell Jones Cage'''<ref>''The New Avengers'' #50 (April 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]] and first appeared in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #1 (November 2001), as part of Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|Max]], an [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]] for more mature content, and was later [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively established]] to have [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 (June 1963) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] as an originally unnamed classmate of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. Within the context of Marvel's [[Marvel Universe|shared universe]], Jones is a former superhero who becomes the owner (and usually sole employee) of Alias Private Investigations. Bendis envisioned the series as centered on [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]] and only decided to create Jones once he realized that the main character had a distinct voice and background that differentiated her from Drew. Since her debut, Jessica Jones has been labelled as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female heroes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Greatest Female Marvel Super Heroes {{!}} Top Marvel Women {{!}} Marvel News |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-greatest-female-marvel-super-heroes |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=Marvel Entertainment |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Baker-Whitelaw |first=Gavia |date=2017-09-21 |title=The top 30 female superheroes of all time |url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/female-superheroes/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=The Daily Dot |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=published |first=George Marston |date=2022-08-02 |title=The best female superheroes |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/best-female-superheroes/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Looking For A Role Model?

Jones has since starred in three [[ongoing series]]: ''Alias'', ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', and ''[[Jessica Jones (comic book)|Jessica Jones]]'', the latter published as a [[tie-in]] with the [[Jessica Jones (TV series)|self-titled television series]]. ''Alias'' ran for 28 issues before ending in 2004, while ''The Pulse'' ran for 14 issues from April 2004 to May 2006, and ''Jessica Jones'' debuted in October 2016. She became a member of the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], alongside her husband, [[Luke Cage]], during Marvel's 2010 [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]] campaign. She has used various aliases throughout her history, including '''Jewel''', '''Knightress''', '''Mrs. Cage''', and '''Power Woman'''.

[[Krysten Ritter]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] streaming television series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' and ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''. [[Elizabeth Cappuccino]] portrayed a young Jessica in the first and second seasons of ''Jessica Jones''. She has also been featured in various video games.

== Creation ==
Jessica Jones debuted in the [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' in November 2001. The character and series were created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]]. While Jones was created in 2001, she was retroactively established to have appeared earlier: in ''Alias'' #22, it is revealed that Jones appears just off-panel in the events of ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15, the first appearance of Spider-Man, and Bendis's ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] #51'' [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively establishes]] her to have first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 (June 1963) as an originally unnamed classmate of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. ''Alias'' ran for 28 issues from 2001 to 2004, with most covers drawn by [[David W. Mack]]. After the end of the series, Jones and other characters from the series moved to Bendis' subsequent series, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''. In a 2005 interview,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5475 | title=Spider-Love: Bendis on 'Spider-Woman: Origin' and New Ongoing Series | first=Jonah | last=Weiland |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=August 5, 2005 | access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref> Bendis claimed:

: Originally, ''Alias'' was going to star [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], but it became something else entirely. Which is good, because had we used Jessica, it would have been off continuity and bad storytelling." Previously, Bendis commented, "I was at one time toying with doing Jessica Drew [in ''Alias''] because she has the best hair of any superhero in comics, but this book is entirely different than what that idea was to be.<ref>''Powers'' #11, letters pages</ref>

By the time Bendis was actively developing the title, Jones was his central character, one with a distinct background and voice from Drew's.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-61/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #61 | first=Brian | last=Cronin |publisher=Comic Book Resources| date=July 27, 2006 | access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref>

Jessica Jones appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). In a [[Marvel Comics]] [[podcast]], Bendis expressed his desire to incorporate Jones into the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marvel.com/rss/podcasts/Ult_SM_100_Bendis.mp3 | title=Marvel Comics podcast | access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #106, she appears as a senior at [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s school.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Origin ===
Midtown High student Jessica Campbell goes to school with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], on whom she has a crush and is present when he is bitten by the irradiated [[spider]] which gives him superpowers.<ref name= "auto">[[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #22 (May 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jessica's father receives tickets for [[Walt Disney World|Disney World]] from his boss [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. On the way home, their car collides with a military convoy carrying radioactive chemicals. Her family is killed, and she spends several months in a coma. Upon waking, she is placed in an orphanage and adopted by the Jones family.<ref name="auto"/> Jessica later discovers that her radiation exposure granted her super strength, limited invulnerability, and flight.

Jessica's adoptive parents re-enroll her at Midtown High, where she is ostracized by her classmates, especially [[Flash Thompson]]. Peter Parker (who has since become [[Spider-Man]]) senses in Jessica a kindred spirit—someone who has also lost her family due to a tragic circumstance. Jessica mistakes his kind attention for pity and lashes out at him.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> She later witnesses a fight between Spider-Man and the villain [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] in her school. This inspires her to use her abilities for positive ends.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Early years ===
{{Main|Alias (comics)}}
As Jewel, Jones has a fairly uneventful superhero career until she intervenes in a disturbance at a restaurant involving Zebediah Killgrave, the [[Purple Man]]. Killgrave uses his power of [[mind control]] to place Jones under his command, psychologically torturing her and forcing her to aid his criminal schemes.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''Alias'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Killgrave sends her to kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] at the [[Avengers Mansion]], Jones is rescued by [[Carol Danvers]], the only Avenger who actually knows her.<ref name=A26>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #26.

''Alias'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> During this time, Jones develops a brief romantic relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Clay Quartermain]].<ref name=A26 />

Due to the traumatic violation of her mind by Killgrave and the fact that she was barely noticed missing for eight months, a demoralized and depressed Jones gives up her costumed superhero life.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #25–26. Marvel Comics.</ref> She briefly adopts a darker identity as the Knightress and interrupts a crime meeting between the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and a [[made man|mafioso]], through which she meets up with fellow superhero [[Luke Cage]]. After defeating the Owl, she and Cage develop a lasting friendship.<ref name=Pulse14>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Pulse'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> No longer a superhero, Jones opens a private detective agency. Longtime friend Carol Danvers sets Jones up with Scott Lang (the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]), and the two date for several months. She also has an off-and-on affair with Cage.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Killgrave, still obsessed with Jones, escapes from high-security incarceration, but with the mental defenses Grey gave her, Jones breaks his control and knocks him out.<ref name=A28/>

Later, Cage and Jones admit their feelings for each other. After she becomes pregnant with their child, they commit to their relationship.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''Alias'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''The Pulse'' and ''Young Avengers'' ===
{{Main|The Pulse (comics)}}
Jones takes a leave from the detective business and joins the staff of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' newspaper as a superhero correspondent and consultant, becoming a main character of the comic book ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'' and a contributor to the same-name fictional newspaper supplement within. A pregnant Jones is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] after the ''Bugle'' reported that he was secretly industrialist Norman Osborn. In response, Cage retaliates, and Osborn is exposed as the Goblin upon his defeat and incarceration.

Jones quits her job with the ''Bugle'' after publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] uses the paper to smear the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. Jones and Cage are living together when she gives birth to their child, whom they name [[Danielle Cage|Danielle]] after Luke's best friend, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]].<ref name=Pulse14/> Cage and Jones marry.<ref>''The New Avengers'' Annual #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jones appears as a supporting character in ''[[Young Avengers]]'' until the series ended. She returns in ''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #6 in which she, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] attempted to defuse the situation between the Avengers and X-Men who were fighting over who was to punish the [[Scarlet Witch]]. She helps fight [[Doctor Doom]] and is present when Stature and the [[Vision (Jonas)|Vision]] are killed. She is seen hugging [[Hulkling]] in the final panel when the team is declared full-fledged Avengers by [[Captain America]].

=== "Civil War", "Secret Invasion" and "Dark Reign" ===
In Marvel's 2006–2007 crossover storyline "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", Jones and Cage reject [[Iron Man]] and [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'s offer to join the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. As part of the New Avengers, Jones moves into [[Doctor Strange]]'s [[Sanctum Sanctorum (Marvel Comics)|Sanctum Sanctorum]], but after an attack involving the demonic villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], Jones is shaken by the experience. Desperate to protect her child, she leaves the New Avengers and registers for the Superhuman Registration Act, ending her relationship with Luke Cage.<ref>''The New Avengers'' Annual #2 (2008).

Marvel Comics.</ref> Jessica reveals that she was inspired to become a superheroine after witnessing an early battle between Spider-Man and the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].

Jessica later appears as an ally to the Mighty Avengers team formed by Luke Cage. Jessica and Danielle lived in the apartment of the Gem Theater, which was serving as the Mighty Avenger's base of operations. She and Luke would later be confronted by the [[Superior Spider-Man]] and his Spider Robots, who offered her a place on a different type of Avengers team that was to be run by him. Jessica swiftly found a babysitter for her child and refused before delivering a powerful punch to Spider-Man's face for his threat. The group was later backed up by [[She-Hulk]] and she and Jessica decided to go out for coffee. Jessica and Luke later switched apartments with an old friend of Luke's named David Griffiths. While moving in, Jessica spoke to the [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]] about what it is like to raise a child of superheroes and expressed both her support and annoyance at her husband's choice to start another team of Avengers.

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Jessica Jones became a member of the Defenders alongside Daredevil, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage. Alongside Cloak and Dagger, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Woman, she fought the Army of Evil during [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s rise to power where they were defeated by Nitro. Jessica Jones and those with him were trapped in the [[Darkforce]] dome by [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]] when his powers were enhanced by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] using the [[Darkhold]].<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In October 2016, ''[[Jessica Jones (comic book)|Jessica Jones]]'', a new ongoing series, debuted. Another title, ''[[Defenders (comics)#2017 series|Defenders]]'', was launched in 2017. Jessica is one of its main characters.

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage assist Iron Man and Spider-Man in searching for Wolverine when his body has gone missing from his unmarked grave where they attend an underworld auction and fight [[Mister Sinister]]. After the mission ends, Jessica and Luke learn from Tony Stark what he found in Mister Sinister's database as he informs them that one of the X-Men members is not a mutant and is a genetically-altered sleeper agent.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The [[Adamantium]] Agenda'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In 2022, ''The Variants,'' a five-issue limited series by writer [[Gail Simone]] and artist [[Phil Noto]], began.  The series is about Jessica taking on a case that leads her to meet alternate universe versions of herself.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gail Simone Brings Jessica Jones Into Her Own Multiverse With 'The Variants' |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/gail-simone-jessica-jones-multiverse-the-variants |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=Marvel Entertainment |language=en}}</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
After coming into contact with experimental chemicals and spending some time in a coma, Jessica emerged with superhuman abilities. She possesses superhuman strength and durability, as well as flight, and can block mind control.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-03-26 |title=Who is Marvel's ‘Jessica Jones’? |url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/4/46208/Who-is-Marvel-s-‘Jessica-Jones’ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=EgyptToday}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Wilson |first=John |date=2020-04-07 |title=Marvel: 10 Things Everyone Forgets About Jessica Jones |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-jessica-jones-facts/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-10-05 |title=Everything You Need to Know About Jessica Jones, Marvel's Most Badass Detective |url=https://gizmodo.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jessica-jones-marvel-1734716668 |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=Gizmodo |language=en-us}}</ref> She shows the capacity to lift a two-ton police car with little effort. Her strength has allowed her to lift up a giant-sized Goliath by the nostrils and toss him a short distance, break Atlas's nose, and render her fellow superheroine Jessica Drew unconscious with a single punch to the face. She later withstood being punched by a human on Mutant-Growth Hormone, sustained only mild bruising and a bloody nose, and was able to recover in moments, after being shocked by Jessica Drew's venom blasts. Despite this resistance to harm, Jessica sustained severe injuries, including a damaged spine and neck, a detached retina, and a broken nose after being attacked by both the Vision and Iron Man.<ref name="A26"/>

Jessica is also able to fly, and while she was able to fly quite well during her early years as a heroine, she has admitted that her flying ability degenerated while she was no longer an active hero. She has since displayed improved flying ability after joining the New Avengers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goodwillie |first=Ian |date=2020-04-27 |title=The Punisher Vs.

After her ordeal at the hands of the Purple Man, Jessica was given a degree of psionic protection by [[Jean Grey]] of the X-Men. This psionic protection was sufficient to protect Jessica against a second attack by the Purple Man, though she had to "trigger" this resistance on her own.<ref name="A28"/>

In addition to her superhuman powers, Jessica is a skilled detective and investigative journalist.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #1–28. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name=":5" />

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
George Marston of ''[[Newsarama]]'' called Jessica Jones one of the "best female superheroes of all time," asserting, "Jessica Jones isn't your typical superhero – like her husband, Luke Cage, she doesn't even have a superhero codename that's stuck. But that's part of what makes her so great, and so unique among not just female superheroes, but superheroes in general. Gifted (or cursed, when you consider how she got her powers) with super-strength, flight, and invulnerability, Jessica got her powers as a teen when a chemical truck collided with her family's car, killing her parents and putting her in a coma. Though the development of her powers led to personal struggles through her early life (including a notoriously horrific kidnapping by the mind-controlling Purple Man), Jessica eventually became an Avenger, and one of the defining heroes of a certain era of the Marvel Universe. She's also a superhero mom, and even though that's caused its share of troubles for her, Jessica has fought through it all as a committed family woman as well as a hero."<ref name=":1"/> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' referred to Jessica Jones as one "greatest female superheroes of all time," stating, "A truly modern subversion of the superhero genre. Jessica Jones is a recent addition to Marvel canon, created for the adult-rated comic ''Alias''. She’s a hard-drinking private detective with super strength and a dark past. She used to be a traditional costumed superheroine named Jewel. However, she dropped the persona after being brainwashed and abused by the mind-controlling supervillain Kilgrave. Now struggling with PTSD and alcoholism, she’s a private eye in New York. Best known for her acclaimed Netflix series, Jessica Jones is married to Luke Cage. She often teams up with the Avengers and other street-level New York superheroes in the comics."<ref name=":0"/> Riya Hotchandani of ''[[Sportskeeda]]'' named Jessica Jones one of the "most skilled detectives in comics," saying, "Jessica Jones is widely known among comic book fans as one of the greatest detectives in the Marvel universe. From her first appearance as a private detective in Alias Investigations to being an Avenger after marrying Luke Cage, Jones has solved many challenging cases. She is clever and street smart and possesses a range of powers like superhuman strength, superhuman durability, telepathic resistance, and accelerated healing. Apart from being a star PI, Jessica has also been an investigative journalist for The Pulse, which has made her skills shine in front of the world."<ref name=":5"/> Deirdre Kaye of ''[[Scary Mommy]]'' of described Jessica Jones as one of the "most popular and well-loved female Marvel characters," writing, "What’s not to love about the surly and sarcastic Jessica Jones? You may remember her from the brilliant Netflix series. She has a pretty average comic book existence: Dead parents, run-in with a super serum that gives her special powers… you know the drill. The difference with Jessica Jones really lies in her personality. She’s like a female Wolverine — leather jacket and all. While she spent some time in full superhero mode as Jewel, fighting with the Avengers, that level of optimism just wasn't her speed. Jessica is a private detective a la Veronica Mars."<ref name=":2"/>

Shawn S. Lealos of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' referred to Jessica Jones as a "huge star," stating, "Jessica Jones became a household name when her Marvel Netflix series was a critical hit. The character is a relative newcomer to the Marvel Universe, debuting in 2001, but she ended up as an important street-level hero and was quickly a member of the Avengers shortly after her introduction into the comics. While the Netflix series followed her as a private investigator, she actually has a rich history in Marvel Comics, although it was always behind the scenes until her official debut. The hero has gone on to marry one of Marvel's strongest heroes and has been part of some of the biggest crossover storylines in the company since her debut, giving her a history that is much deeper than her short time in comics might indicate. [...] Jessica Jones has done a lot since she made her debut in Marvel Comics. However, she has also paid it forward. In much the same way that Captain Marvel helped save Jessica and set her on the path to recovery, Jones saw some teenage heroes in need of direction and was instrumental in helping the Young Avengers form."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2021-10-02 |title=10 Things Only Comic Book Fans Know About Jessica Jones |url=https://screenrant.com/jessica-jones-marvel-comic-fans-facts-trivia/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> Gary Walker of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called Jessica Jones one of Marvel's "most seasoned street-level heroes," stating, "Jessica Jones has the abilities of someone who should be helping out Captain Marvel or even the Guardians of the Galaxy. She had issues learning to fly initially, though this has since been mastered. Her strength and durability would allow her to hold court among the chief Avengers. This is not Jessica’s calling however. She’s done a great job battling her own inner demons, trying to become a better person and hero. Her bond with Luke Cage elevated not only her own self-confidence but made both partners better by association.

The story of a retired lesser-known superhero named Jewel who becomes a private eye, the explicit comic explored the harsh realities of being a hero.

But there are exceptions. Two of Marvel's most entertaining writers - Buffy creator Joss Whedon and Lost staff writer Brian K Vaughn - have casts full of believable women. (Try Whedon's ''Astonishing X Men'' Volume 1: Gifted or Vaughn's ''Runaways'' Volume 1: Pride and Joy.) But perhaps the greatest female superhero of recent years is Brian Michael Bendis's Jessica Jones. Formerly a flying crime-fighter called Jewel, Jones hangs up her cape to become a private investigator. For more than 40 issues - now collected in a series of paperbacks starting with ''Alias'' Volume 1 - Bendis took us inside her head, creating one of the bravest, wittiest and most sensitive portraits of a female character that superhero comics have ever seen. Plus, she had a realistic body and didn't try to battle evil in a gold bikini and stiletto heels."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-07-30 |title=Superheroes need rescuing from sexism |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jul/30/superheroesneedrescuingfrom |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

Graeme Mcmillian of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' stated, "The comic book that introduced Jessica Jones launched Marvel's "R-rated" Max imprint, finally letting fans know that their favorite superheroes ''did'', in fact, know how to swear, they just felt very uncomfortable doing it. Taking full advantage of the freedoms offered by the imprint, creators Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos created Jones to be one of the company's most well-rounded female characters: flawed, bitter, self-destructive, and far more optimistic than she would ever allow anyone else to see. The roots of ''Jessica Jones'' are all here."<ref>{{Cite news |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |title=Read These Comics Before Watching Jessica Jones |language=en-US |work=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/11/jessica-jones-reading-list/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |issn=1059-1028}}</ref> Guillermo Kurten of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' ranked the ''Alias'' comic book series 5th in their "Brian Michael Bendis' best comic books" list, saying, "''Alias'' was Bendis' gritty run alongside artist Michael Gaydos on superhero-turned-private investigator Jessica Jones. In this series, Jessica Jones was once known as the superhero Jewel but turned away from that life. ''Alias'' was praised for its approach as a psychological character study, with the series unraveling pieces of Jessica Jones' past and developing her character as she learns to heal from her trauma."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kurten |first=Guillermo |date=2022-05-31 |title=Brian Michael Bendis's Best Comic Books |url=https://screenrant.com/brian-michael-bendis-best-comic-books/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Jessica Jones'' #1 a grade of 8.8 out of 10, writing, "This issue is a perfect showcase for why it was so important to have both creators on board, not just Bendis. Gaydos' heavy black lines and generally moody style showcase a side of the Marvel Universe that's rarely seen anywhere else. The book has a vague noir quality, but also a humble slice-of-life one as well. This is a series that can showcase the shining heroes of the Marvel Universe and its most ordinary citizens. It's been a long time coming, but Jessica Jones has the solo book she deserves again. And with both Brian Bendis and Michael Gaydos back at the helm, this new series has little trouble recapturing the appeal of its predecessor. The fact that so much about Jessica's life has reverted to the old status quo isn't a drawback, but rather one of the book's main selling points."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2016-10-06 |title=Jessica Jones #1 Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/06/jessica-jones-1-review |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> Blair Marnell of ''[[Nerdist]]'' gave ''Jessica Jones'' #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, stating, "It is a lot of fun to see her back in action, even if she doesn’t quite have the same edge that she did in her original run. There’s some minor swearing in the issue, but it feels a little tame, even though it does come with one of Marvel’s rare “not for kids!” warnings. If we didn’t know that Gaydos drew these pages within the last year, we’d swear that this was a lost story from his original run. Gaydos’ style isn’t for everyone, but he is the definitive ''Jessica Jones'' artist. It just wouldn’t be the same book without him. Gaydos’ action scenes aren’t flashy, but there was a fun moment when Jessica was confronted by a very angry heroine who was a friend of the family before Jess apparently burned her bridges. However, Gaydos’ best pages capture Jessica’s reactions to her new situation and to the craziness that still inhabits her life. Despite everything she’s lived through, Jessica still carries herself as an outsider. That’s always a compelling lens to view this world through. We’re admittedly quite curious to discover how Jessica blew up her life, considering how angry nearly everyone is at her. Bendis and Gaydos have torn her back down to a nearly pre-''Alias'' state. But the fun will be seeing Jessica slowly crawl her way out of this hole that she’s created for herself."<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Heroine Falls Hard in JESSICA JONES #1 (Review) — Nerdist |url=https://archive.nerdist.com/a-heroine-falls-hard-in-jessica-jones-1-review/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=archive.nerdist.com}}</ref>

Joe Ruggirello of ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Jessica Jones'' #2 a grade of 8.9 out of 10, asserting, "It just feels right to have the Bendis/Gaydos version of Jessica Jones back in the pages of Marvel Comics. This issue improves upon last month’s debut, with Jessica and Luke Cage’s cheerful and heartwarming (no wait, what’s the literal exact opposite of that?) reunion setting the stage for a series that seems to pick up right where we left off 12 years ago. As per usual, things are going terribly for Jessica, and along with a fatal twist in her case it appears one of Daredevil’s least favorite foes has a bone to pick with her. The visual of Jessica fly-falling across the rooftops of New York sums things up perfectly. Of course, this new series wouldn’t be the same without Michael Gaydos. His rendering of past Luke and Jessica is made poignant by their current state, the passage of time and damage done clearly expressed in their eyes."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |last2=Ruggirello |first2=Joe |date=2016-11-17 |title=Comic Book Reviews for November 16, 2016 |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/17/comic-book-reviews-for-november-16-2016 |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> Sean Edgar of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' included ''Jessica Jones'' #2 in their "Best Comic Book Covers of November 2016" list.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-11-17 |title=The Best Comic Book Covers of November 2016 |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/comics/comic-covers/the-best-comic-book-covers-of-november-2016/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=pastemagazine.com |language=en}}</ref>

Chase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''Jessica Jones - Marvel Digital Original'' #1 a grade of 5 out of 5, saying, "Jessica Jones is in very good hands. This first, surprise issue nails everything that readers have come to want from the character. The dialogue is pitch perfect, taking readers on a tour of the Marvel universe with plenty of small jokes, affectionate exchanges, and banter. There is a great detective story that plays out like a Chandler novel with an excellent added touch of drawing out details with inset panels. Most of all, there is a lot of heart both in Jessica's attitude and the family she has built. There is simply a lot to like about this comic that serves as both an introduction and continuation of one of Marvel's best. What a pleasant surprise."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 7/18/2018 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/comic-reviews-marvel-dc-image-230720/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref> Jesse Schedeen of ''[[IGN]]'' included the ''Jessica Jones - Marvel Digital Original'' comic book series in their "Top Comics to Buy This Week" list in the week of October 29, 2019, stating, "Jessica Jones is one of the many major new characters Brian Bendis co-created during his long tenure at Marvel, and a heroine in need of a new steward now that Bendis has moved to DC. She found that in Kelly Thompson, the Marvel writer perhaps best suited to continue Jessica's troubled journey. For better or worse, Marvel elected to publish Thompson and Mattia De Lulis' Jessica Jones miniseries in digital-only form earlier this year. Whether it flew under the radar at the time or you simply prefer print to digital, now's your chance to see Jessica flourish under a new creative team."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=2018-10-29 |title=Top Comics to Buy This Week: Heroes in Crisis #2, Old Man Logan #50 and More |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/29/top-comics-to-buy-this-week-heroes-in-crisis-2-old-man-logan-50-and-more |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref> Sam Stone of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called the ''Jessica Jones - Marvel Digital Original'' comic book series one of the "best Jessica Jones stories," asserting, "Arriving in 2018, ''Jessica Jones: Blind Spot'' was a three-issue Marvel Digital series by Kelly Thompson and Mattia De Lulis. This was a new team to take on the character, but they smartly kept the private investigation aspects of her story and added a new look. In this, Jessica investigated a serial killer in New York City killing women with powers. When someone framed Jessica, she went to Doctor Strange for help and the body count began to rise.

==== ''Jessica Jones: Purple Daughter'' ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Jessica Jones: Purple Daughter'' #1 was the 321st best selling graphic novel in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |last=MacDonald |first=Heidi |date=2020-01-14 |title=Syndicated Comics |url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/the-500-top-selling-graphic-novels-and-comics-of-2019/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=The Beat |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: 2019 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2019.html |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref>

Peyton Hinckle of ''[[ComicsVerse]]'' wrote, "You can’t really talk about ''Jessica Jones: Purple Daughter'' without talking about the art and, more specifically, the artist. Mattia De Iulis pulls out what might be his best work for this series. Realistic, yet distinctive, Iulis has a style that naturally lends itself to darker comics (like ''Jessica Jones: Purple Daughter''). An artist with heavily stylized linework just wouldn’t have given the series the same weight and sense of reality. Part of the reason why we feel like Jessica’s life really is falling apart is because she has a relatable face. Iulis’ work is so realistic that it almost feels like readers are peaking into Jessica’s non-fictitious story. As emotions run high for Jessica, emotions run high for readers as well. The second artist, Filipe Andrade, penciled the fake reality scene, where Jessica briefly thinks she’s an idyllic little housewife. Iulis’ realistic style definitely wouldn’t have worked for this portion of the story. Andrade’s heavily stylized linework perfectly emphasizes the distance Jessica has from reality at this point in the plot. This series flew under a lot of comic fans’ radar. Since it’s an online-only series, it didn’t get publicity from LCBS or an array of variant covers. It’s not nearly as flashy as most of Marvel’s recent publications but, quality wise, it’s better. From the storyline to the art, this series excels in almost every way. If you’ve never read Jessica Jones, ''Jessica Jones: Purple Daughter'' is for you…and, honestly, if you’ve read tons of Jessica Jones’ arcs, ''Jessica Jones: Purple Daughter'' is still for you. It’s what so few comics are nowadays: complex, entertaining, and visually stunning. Don’t miss out on it."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hinckle |first=Peyton |date=April 5, 2019 |title=JESSICA JONES: PURPLE DAUGHTER Is the New Marvel Series You’ve Been Looking For |url=https://comicsverse.com/jessica-jones-purple-daughter-series/ |website=[[ComicsVerse]]}}</ref> Christian Jones of ''[[Stardust (magazine)|Stardust]]'' gave ''Jessica Jones: Purple Daughter'' #1 a 9-star rating, saying, "Kelly Thompson expertly establishes the event that has torn Luke and Jessica’s lives apart and the ensuing trauma of that. As a reader, you feel the doubt, the anger and the helplessness that these characters feel. As a mother, Jessica is placed in the most horrifying position that a parent can be placed in. Absolute and unconditional love for her child whilst having to face her worst nightmare every time she looks at her baby. Jessica Jones creator Brian Michael Bendis’ great talent was humanising his characters, but Thompson has taken it to a whole other level. The artwork by Mattia de Lulis is simply wonderful. There’s a photographic realism to his work that suits the story and characters perfectly. The characters are the focus of every panel with the background being less distinct unless it serves the scene. This allows the reader to be really drawn in by the story without becoming distracted by superfluous details. The use of colour, shading, and lighting is also used to the utmost effect, creating a truly convincing piece of neo-noir on the printed page. If Marvel Comics should ever revisit the Noir universe, a Jessica Jones caper set amongst seedy whiskey-soaked, smoke-filled bars in New York’s criminal underworld is a must. After Brian Michael Bendis’ triumphant run, Kelly Thompson’s assured direction of Jessica Jones looks set to flourish. Bendis created a cynical, flawed, world-weary, reluctant superhero. It’s exciting to see what facets Thompson will bring to one of Marvel Comics most interesting characters."<ref>{{Cite web |title=JESSICA JONES: PURPLE DAUGHTER #1 |url=https://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/jessica-jones-purple-daughter-1 |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=STARBURST Magazine |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Grace wright of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' called ''Jessica Jones: Blind Spot'' #1 a "brilliant new take," saying, "While ''Blind Spot'' is significant for a number of reasons, Thompson hits on one of the biggest in a letter at the end of the first issue: it's the first time Jessica Jones’s original creative team, Bendis and Gaydos, have passed the torch to a new writer and artist in a solo book. Jessica Jones made her first appearance in ''Alias #1'' almost two decades ago, and has been making expletive-filled waves in the Marvel Universe ever since. Jessica has certainly come a long way from her days begging for an audience at the front gates of the Avengers mansion, with her marriage to Luke Cage and the birth of their daughter, Dani Cage. Bendis and Gaydos have seen her through a number of trials and evolutions, but Thompson and De Iulis are ready to grab the character's reins and take her back to... a new sort of origin. ''Blind Spot'' successfully gives readers a new insight into Jessica Jones, without trodding on any of the character’s development in years past. In fact, before one of Jessica's many haunting decisions reappears, she is more intently focused on her domestic life than any sort of imminent doom. Jessica seems to have grown, picking out the correctly-shaped cereal for her toddler, as opposed to whiskey for herself. While that isn't where Jessica is going to stay, it's a nice acknowledgment of Bendis and Gaydos’ work, setting the tone for Thompson and De Iulis as they undertake the mighty feat of forging their own path in Jessica’s story."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wright |first=Grace |date=2020-01-17 |title=Review: JESSICA JONES: BLIND SPOT #1 Offers a Brilliant New Take (Again) |url=https://screenrant.com/jessica-jones-origin-blind-spot-marvel/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== ''The Variants'' ====
According to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]],''The Variants'' #1 was the 94th best selling comic book in June 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rokk |date=2022-07-10 |title=June 2022 Single Issue Comic Book Sales Rankings |url=https://www.comicbookrevolution.com/june-2022-single-issue-sales-rankings/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=Comic Book Revolution |language=en}}</ref>

Hannah Rose of ''[[CBR.com]]'' called ''The Variants'' #1 an "intriguing first issue," stating, "Simone captures Jessica's essence well, balancing her hardened if heavy-handed cynicism with her vulnerability and humanity. The sequence where Jess tries on varying shades of lipstick under the watchful eye of the sales clerk is one of the best instances of this softer, more insecure, and human side of the otherwise badass and uncompromising character. Similarly, her more compassionate side is forced out by Daredevil as both hero and attorney, calling on her to assist one of his clients, a girl similarly manipulated by the Purple Man. Jess and Daredevil's relationship here is an uneasy one, their trust in one another is tested thanks to Daredevil's lie-detecting powers, yet the respect between them is plain as day. Powerhouse artist Phil Noto takes the reigns in ''Variants'' #1. His line art is elegant, smooth, fluid, and pretty to look at. He sticks to realistic body proportions with just enough stylistic liberty to keep everything easy on the eye and purely in the realm of fiction. He uses a soft, muted color palette with occasional washes of color, especially blue and fuschia. But, for the most part, he keeps things grounded with an appropriately sad, drab beige. ''Variants'' #1 demonstrates an excellent understanding of an often underutilized character, exploring her mindset and morals in the aftermath of a harrowing event. Unfortunately, its use of the multiverse leaves viewers wanting more. Time will tell if these different versions of Jessica's character and the alternate worlds they inhabit can be given the attention they deserve."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rose |first=Hannah |date=2022-06-29 |title=REVIEW: Marvel's The Variants #1 |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-variants-1-comic-review/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Jenna Anderso of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' gave ''The Variants'' #1 a grade of 5 out of 5, asserting, "''The Variants'' #1 is not only a beautifully-constructed new look at the Marvel multiverse that fans know and love, it's a truly stunning and revolutionary new chapter in the ongoing story of Jessica Jones. Gail Simone's script brings the heartfelt, but world-weary tone that Jessica uniquely embodies, while laying the groundwork for a fascinating new twist on doppelgangers from another universe. When coupled with Phil Noto's effortlessly cool and timeless art, The Variants is an absolute knockout for Marvel Comics, and I could not be more excited to see what else it has in store."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 6/29/2022 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/new-comic-reviews-dc-marvel-image-june-29-2022/ |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref>

Multiple versions of Jessica Jones have appeared in [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel's multiverse]]. In the 2005 "[[House of M]]" [[fictional crossover|storyline]], Jessica was apparently dating Scott Lang.<ref>''House of M'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'',<ref>''What If Jessica Jones Had Joined the Avengers?'' vol. 3 #1, February (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Jones accepted Captain America's offer to work for The Avengers. Perceiving that something was amiss with Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch), she alerted the other Avengers, ensuring that the catastrophic events depicted in "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" and "[[House of M]]" would never occur. Jessica married [[Captain America]].

In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'',<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #106 Marvel Comics.</ref> Jones appeared as a senior student in the school [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] attended. She was the executive producer of the school's television network. She later became jealous of [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s superior film skills. She attempted to deduce Spider-Man's secret identity for the school newspaper and may have been suspicious about Peter Parker. Later on after the events of ''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]'', she claimed to have abandoned her attempts to figure out who Spider-Man was and instead wanted to focus on his heroics.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'', Jessica was a student at Mary Jane's high school and was a former friend of Mary Jane until she became a goth. Mary Jane spent more time with Jessica after her breakup with Ned Leeds and became more goth-like until Jessica told Mary Jane it did not fit her.

During the events of "[[Infinity Wars]]," [[Gamora]] used the Infinity Stones to fold the universe in half, resulting in the creation of Warp World, where characters and histories were merged. Jessica Jones merged with [[Janice Lincoln]] and became this universe's version of the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]. She was also the fiancé of Scott Banner aka Little Monster (an amalgamation of Scott Lang and Bruce Banner).<ref>''Infinity Wars: Sleepwalker'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Spider-Man: Life Story'', Jessica briefly dated Peter Parker after his split with Mary Jane and helped him track down the elderly Norman Osborn. Much like her Earth-616 counterpart, Jessica Jones of this universe also began a private investigator and founder of Alias Investigations.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #4</ref>

During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, different versions of Jessica Jones existed in each of the [[Battleworld]] domains:
* In the Battleworld domain of Arcadia, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones assisted in fighting a horde of zombies from the Deadlands after the female Loki attacked part of the Shield.<ref>''A-Force'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* In the Battleworld domain of the Walled City of New York, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones are married and live in their residence in Harlem.<ref>''Secret Wars: Secret Love'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

**Jessica Jones first appears in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''. As a child, she was in a car accident that killed her parents and put her in a coma. After she regained consciousness, Jessica was legally adopted by talent agent Dorothy Walker, thereby becoming the adopted sister of [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]]. She did her graduation from [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown School of Science and Technology]] in [[Queens]], the same school in which [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] used to study, although she graduated much earlier from the school when Parker had not even joined, unlike in the comics in which Parker and her were classmates. As an adult, Jessica crosses paths with [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]] and spends eight months under his control, snapping out of it after she kills [[Luke Cage]]'s wife Reva Connors on Kilgrave's orders. In the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season]], she experiences [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] as a result of what Kilgrave did to her and drinks in excess to numb her pain and guilt. Her Jewel costume from the comics appears briefly in the fifth episode,"AKA: The Sandwich Saved Me", although she refuses to wear it and rejects Trish's suggestion of Jewel as an alias.<ref name="netflixjewel">{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/238434/jessica-jones-and-other-kick-ass-female-heroes-in-plain-clothes/|title=Jessica Jones doesn't wear a superhero costume.

**In the episode "The Blessing of Many Fractures" of the [[Iron Fist (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', [[Joy Meachum]] indirectly mentions to her brother [[Ward Meachum|Ward]] that she hired Jessica in the past to take compromising pictures of members on the Rand Enterprises board of directors.
** Jessica Jones stars in ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''.  After the events of the second season of Daredevil and the first season of Iron Fist, Jones is caught in a conspiracy involving [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]].  In the first episode, Jones investigates the disappearance of a man, and finds explosive items in his apartment.  As the conspiracy widens and eventually ties with the man's disappearance, Jones is attacked by the same man, who kills himself to avoid being captured by a [[Elektra (comics)|masked figure]].  Before his impending death, the man tells Jones about The Hand, who is chasing him for trying to expose their crimes.  Jones then briefly teams up with [[Daredevil (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Matt Murdock]], Jones' ex [[Luke Cage]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]] in a battle against The Hand.  After finding plans from the killed man to destroy the headquarters of The Hand in New York, Jones and Murdock rally their allies to defeat the organization once and for all.  Murdock apparently sacrifices himself to get the others out of the exploding building.  After the battle, Jones moves on and continues to be a detective, while also looking to protect the city.<ref name="ritterusatoday">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/11/20/jessica-jones-mike-colter-luke-cage/76099760/|title='Jessica Jones' star Mike Colter a powerhouse as Luke Cage|last=Truitt|first=Brian|work=[[USA Today]]|date=November 20, 2015|access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>
** In the [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]] of ''Jessica Jones'', Jones takes on a new case after the events surrounding her encounter with Kilgrave. In the [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third season]], Jessica has to deal with a highly intelligent psychopath.
**Jessica Jones is referenced by the character Marci Stahl in episode 5 of season 2 of the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', whilst she is talking to Foggy, as a colleague in her office who is a target of the DEA because of her vigilantism. In the season 3 finale, Matt Murdock jokes that, as a private investigator, Karen Page is "more stable than Jessica Jones."
