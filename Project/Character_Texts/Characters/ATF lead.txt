This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there. Get down!  It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts.  Of course we're sure!  We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our ''job'' to know what these fanatics do! Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them. What's the situation? Any luck talking to somebody in the house? Alright. Johnson! I'm sending you in. Watch your ass. Damn it, where is Johnson?! Those bastards!  Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan! Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot-  Did you see them move?! Lay down your weapons! Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them.  I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique. This is what we did in Waco.  Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will.
