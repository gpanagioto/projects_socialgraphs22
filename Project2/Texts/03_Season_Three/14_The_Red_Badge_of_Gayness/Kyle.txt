Cartman, what the hell are you doing? Well, you ''have'' to hit it softer! You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat! Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow! Cartman!!!  Give me the drum, and you play the flute. You dick! He'll show. Wow, dude! Your grandpa ''still'' isn't dead? Yeah! You're dressed up like the South. The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war! No they're not, stupid! How much do you wanna bet?! Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?! And if the North wins you're our slave for a month?? You're on! Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War. What do we do?! You cheated, Cartman! Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have ''known'' that! They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop. I know, butâ€”why do they have to take it out on us? Why do ''we'' have to wait around for them to come back? Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves?? We have to stop him, dude. We'll give you 10 bucks. You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves! Hey! Yeah. Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno- We'll never stop them now. Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States. Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year. Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off!  Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month! What?? Yeah. Thanks, dick!
