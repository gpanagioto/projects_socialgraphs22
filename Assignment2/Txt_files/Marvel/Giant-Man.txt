==Fictional character biography==
===Hank Pym===
[[Hank Pym]] was the original character named Giant-Man. He used that super hero identity after joining the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' with Wasp, Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk.<ref>''The Avengers'' #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Goliath, Hank Pym led the Avengers after Captain America left the team. He married his girlfriend Wasp and also created the artificial intelligence better known as [[Ultron]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #60. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Giant-Man, Pym fought villains like the [[Whirlwind (comics)|Human Top]] and [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], and many years after, joined the [[Secret Avengers]], the Avengers A.I. and the Avengers Academy. He also helped Wasp escape the Microverse after the "Avengers vs X-Men" conflict. Giant-Man also helped Matt Murdock and his friend Foggy Nelson on many occasions, and fought his enemy Ultron during the ''Rage of Ultron'' event.<ref>''Avengers: Rage of Ultron'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After seemingly dying during the final battle, Pym surprised everyone when he returned as an amalgamation of flesh and Ultron circuitry and encountered the Uncanny Avengers, later joining the team in his new cybernetic form as Ultron. However, the group didn't completely trust him and called the Wasp for help. The Avengers' fears proved true and Pym transformed into Ultron completely, fighting the Unity Division and destroying Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor in the process. The Vision was forced to help the team destroy his "father," but Ultron was later revealed to still be alive.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>
