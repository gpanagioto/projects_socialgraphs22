In the film, Tadashi suggests that Hiro should attend the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology as Hiro is also gifted in robotics and engineering, even more so than Tadashi, his intellect allowing him to graduate from high school at 13. Initially, Hiro dismisses the request, as he chooses to pursue monetary gain from his domination in illegal bot fights in San Fransokyo, even in spite of any risks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Croot|first=James|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/film-reviews/64550052/review-big-hero-6|title=Review: Big Hero 6|website=Stuff.co.nz|date=December 30, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> Tadashi responds to this by redirecting his little brother's intelligence, taking Hiro with him on a quick trip to his college.
