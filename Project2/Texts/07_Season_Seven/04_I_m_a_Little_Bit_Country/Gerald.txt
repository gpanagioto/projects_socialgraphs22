Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school? There was no war months ago! Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah! Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday! Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us! And if it weren't for ''you'' people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.
