 Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore!  Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.  nothing!  Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!  And because we did nothing... they got away.  No... No!  No... No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape! We can't just leave! Aw it's horrible!  Somebody do something! They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!  Aw no... My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible. I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.  Stan? I love you too.  Did you see it? Indy deserved more than that! I know it's hard to think about, but you ''have'' to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel. It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore.  What? We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
