Really? Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department. Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team. Aayy, that's great, Bridon. Eh, your kid is really good at this. Just... go easy on him, huh? If he wants to play ball, you should let him. He's just a kid. All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon? Give 'em hell!
