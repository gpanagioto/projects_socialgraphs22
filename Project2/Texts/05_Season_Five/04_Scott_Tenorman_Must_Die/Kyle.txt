What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?  ...What the hell are you talking about? What's "pubes"? Oh.  No you didn't!   Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader? Cartman, you don't ''buy'' pubes, you grow them yourself! Yuh huh! Because, retard, you're dumb enough to ''buy'' Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars! Yeah. Cartman, can I give you some advice? Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you. One please. Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off. What's in it for us? Okay, Cartman, what do you want?  Oh, Jesus! Okay, so what's the plan? ...What? You're such a dumbass, Cartman.   Scott Tenorman? We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is going' to try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch. 'Cause, we're his friends. 'Cause we hate him. Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya. Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this.  Yeah, sure.  Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
