Somalia? Where's that? Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join. And your mom is okay with that? Yeah maybe we should think about this. This is Somalia? You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr!  No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!  Hard to port! I hate it here and I wanna go home!!
