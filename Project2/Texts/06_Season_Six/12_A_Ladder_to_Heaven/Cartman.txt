You bet your fat clown ass it is!  ...ticket stub? Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?  GODDAMMIT!!! You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember.   Kenny!!! Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!  What the ''fuck'' is closure?! You turned him into a teapot? Wewewewewewe... Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe... ...Kenny?  Kenny?! What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?! God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix! Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?! Hmmm.    Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning! How? I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car.  ...No.  Ey! Euuugh.  Wha-uh, what?? What? I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off. Do you think? Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.  Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet! Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough. Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them. You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O. Because Jews don't believe in heaven! Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it. AH!  ''In the ghetto, <sup>in the ghetto</sup>. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, <sup>in the ghetto</sup>'' What did you say?! What did you say?!  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina? I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.  You're a- stupid Jew.  Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.  Shut up!  Shut ''up!'' That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me. I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body. Looks like I've come to the right place. Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that I need sucked out, please. Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium!  Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out! Eh!  The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  You guys! YOU GUYS!! You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket!  I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere. I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW!  Not by giving me brain damage!  AY!... ...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.  ...Oh Jesus Christ. Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God!
