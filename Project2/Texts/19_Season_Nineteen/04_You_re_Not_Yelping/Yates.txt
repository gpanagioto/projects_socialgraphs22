That's it, Maggie. I'm hanging it up. If people are gonna be trying all the new restaurants in town they'll... have to do it without my reviews. The restaurants put up signs sayin' I can't come in. I don't know why they singled me out, but it's like, people don't need me.  Well I'll be damned. Somebody's put a note in the mailbox... asking me to come and talk to them. They do need me.  I need to get goin'. No, they're just asking for me. I guess...
