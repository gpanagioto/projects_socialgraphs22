What are you thinking about, Babe? You're worried about him again, aren't you? Your friend, Kyle? Then talk to him babe. Tell him what we're doing. Maybe you can get him back. Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset. '''' This is gonna seem a little weird to you, okay? Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was. Before I stopped searching, I learned something.  Take a look. To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it "emoji analysis". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away. After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult. I think... it's one of the parents. I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match. What is it, Eric? What's wrong? Come on. We don't keep secrets, remember? You said you wanted to be perfectly honest with me, always. Yeah. Well I'm glad you told me, 'cause now I know. Of course.  You've never given me a reason not to believe you, babe. You have no reason to worry. People will know it wasn't you. With emoji analysis, everyone will be able to tell exactly where any comments came from.
