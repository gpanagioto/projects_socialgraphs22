''No I don't!'' ''Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!'' Yeah, well I'b I busted out.  Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here. If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids.  Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy. All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while. All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something.  Hey, bring us down some food, all right? Chuck, can you turn that thing down? Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!  Wow, sweet! What's the matter? Oh, bummer. Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials.  The cops are here!  Get down, Ma! What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house! Wow, she's really pissed. Damn it! What are we gonna do? Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?! That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson! Come on, damn it!  Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays.  All right, it's open! Let's go! All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go.   What?! Now can we go?? Oh, weak!  Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me. I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help. 
Shhhhh.  Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat. Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody understands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species. Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain. Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King.   You just don't understand. You'll understand them soon. It's quicker if you don't fight it.  You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication. Yes Emo King, right away.  Don't fight it. It's quicker that way.  Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it. Lowe's Home and Garden? No they- they talk to me! But-  What do you mean? YES!!!  Oh my God, are you serious?  No, they really had me convinced! I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot.
