Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park. But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice. Yes Pip, what is it? I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody. Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does. Sorry son, now get your ass in there.  Hike the damn ball!  Huh? Oh, fine, fine. Elementary school alumni? I don't know. Wha- what's the spread? Hmmm... I don't think we have a chance. Great pass, Stan! Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow. <poem><i>Spank it, ever so gently.</i></poem> <poem><i>Spank it.</i></poem> Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays. No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you. That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it? What's the matter, Stan? You seem down. Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks. Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic. Well, you're gay aren't you? Well, you sure do act like it.  Oohh, come on, Stan... No Pip, I'm sorry! You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle. Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now. What's the matter? Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty. Hike! The! Ball! Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field! Where the hell have you been Stan?! Just get in there boy!
