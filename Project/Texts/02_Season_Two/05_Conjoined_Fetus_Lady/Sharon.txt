Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick? So this ''is'' your fault. Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?
