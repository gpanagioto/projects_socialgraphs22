 Wow, I knew I would win. What? He doesn't even know what he wrote about! My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins. What?  Hitler was famous too. Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated. Hi guys. I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this. Hello? My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."  Oh my God.  You guys, we have to stop him!
