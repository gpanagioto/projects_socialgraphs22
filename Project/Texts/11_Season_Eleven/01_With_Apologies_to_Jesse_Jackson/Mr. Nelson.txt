 I would like to share with you all my- That, that words are like bullets. And if you give- No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon.  Principal Victoria, I am very concerned about the behavior of one of your students. Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all.  I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks. You don't understand.  You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder- You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless. You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.  No matter how you act, I can rise above it!  Shut your fucking mouth! He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking  Aaaaaaa! Excuse me, over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here.  I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, "Hello, fatso!" He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets.  Now you know how it feels.  You'd better shut up or i'm gonna kick your ass!  Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point. AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay!  Okay, you win! Ung-cle! Carol Anne, don't go into the light! There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size.
