 My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?  I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that. Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what? How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow?  Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved.  And the kids never know what hit 'em. The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries  The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality.  But there's never enough teeth. Never enough. And now my only problem is, what do I do with you?  Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me? It's that, or else I can cut off your penises.  I'll cut you in at 2%. They're ''what''?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground!  Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em. Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti? I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles. Well then, throw him in.   Well, well, well. What do we have here? Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski  Aw, drat!  It was a trap! Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along!  How could I be so stupid?! I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?! Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen. Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways. Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with.
