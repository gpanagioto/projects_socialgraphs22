Okay, Not-Kenny. This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick! Cool!  Do you think they'll believe it? Awesome! But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin? Yeah. Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters! We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with ''my'' parents. They'll never know. We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool. That looks awesome!  Episode I sucked balls. Yeah, he sure is. This is gonna be awesome! Wow! Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
