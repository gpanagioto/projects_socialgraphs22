I just... can't believe that children in our town are dressing up in hero costumes and peeing in each other's mouths. Maybe we need to get our kids off of Facebook. I'm sick of getting out of the shower to find Mark Zuckerberg sitting on my toilet! Yeah, and I'm pretty sure his voice is dubbed and he does all his own sound effects. Hey look! The freaky costume kids are getting Zuckerberg! Get him, kids!
