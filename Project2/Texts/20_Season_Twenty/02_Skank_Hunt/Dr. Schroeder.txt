This troll is known only as Skankhunt42.  We believe it probable he's one of the boy students here, since his favorite target seems to be women. Here, you can see Heidi Turner's mother photo shopped with a penis in her mouth, after she defended her daughter's right to sit out the national anthem. Since then, this child has been trolling all over the internet. Visiting message boards, and social media, and filling it with vile comments and hate-filled garbage.  But trolling is on the rise with teenagers, and we all need to come together to stop it. We need every parent to look for the signs in their own child. In order for us to find these secretive monsters, we need all parents to ask themselves: "Could my child be a troll?".
