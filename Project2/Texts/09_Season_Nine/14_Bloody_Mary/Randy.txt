 Oh hey, sorry boys.  Hey, see you Nelson. Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home.  Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going. I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys? ...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan. Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole! Aww crap!  Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal.  What seems to be the officer, problem? Okay.  Okay, no problem. Easy. Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem! Do what?? Wull come on, that's impossible! Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  What? What did I do?!  What did I do?! Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these. Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.  Hi Bill.  Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.  But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic. Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again. What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing. Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again. Uh... a disease?  Oh my God...  Hello, Stan. No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick. Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease.  I can't! I'm sick!  Stan. Stan I... need your help. Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?  I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness! I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle. Cure... cure disease. STAN!!  I gotta drive to Bailey.  No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass. They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!   This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will! I sure hope this works. No. No, it ''will'' work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan! Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Is this the line?  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured? I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism. Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him. I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'? I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You? We are the same, she and I. This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!  You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place. The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go!  I'm going to die! Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it. Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me. Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power. Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?! 'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.  I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic. But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now!   What? That means... I'm ''not'' cured. I still have the disease!  Come ON! Let's GO! You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!  I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon! But the statue wasn't a miracle! You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I ''can'' force myself to never drink again.  No?? But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing. How did I manage to raise such a smart kid? Thanks son. Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.  Well how about four? How about twenty? Right right. Does vodka count?
