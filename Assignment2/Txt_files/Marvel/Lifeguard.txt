'''Lifeguard''' ('''Heather Cameron''') is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is primarily associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Salvador Larroca]], she first appeared in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #6 (Dec. 2001).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=214}}</ref>

She is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], gaining whatever superhuman abilities are needed in a life-threatening situation. She and her brother [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]] were briefly members of the segment of X-Men featured in the series ''X-Treme X-Men.''

Heather and [[Slipstream (comics)|Davis Cameron]] were a lifeguard and a surfer, respectively, living in [[Surfers Paradise]] in [[Australia]]. Unbeknownst to them, their father is an underworld crime lord known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]], and upon his death they were attacked.  Together with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Neal Shaara]] (the new Thunderbird), they managed to defeat their attackers. Heather discovered she was a mutant with the power to manifest whatever was necessary to save the life of someone in danger around her, including her own.  Her power enabled her to manifest wings, golden armor, the ability to breathe underwater, and many other less noticeable adaptations. Heather soon joined the splinter team of X-Men, and formed a romance with Thunderbird.<ref name="X-Treme X-Men #9 March 2002">''X-Treme X-Men'' #9 (March 2002)</ref>

During a mission to infiltrate the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather's appearance changes to resemble the alien [[Shi'ar]] race, and it was theorized that she and Davis had some [[Shi'ar]] heritage. [[Jean Grey]] notes that the cranial markings on her head and the crest of feathers she had manifested indicated Heather is of Shi'ar royal ancestry. Also, an entry from [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diary seems to imply that Heather and Davis were "Mothered by War," or [[Deathbird]]. The entry shows a picture of Deathbird and some of the X-Treme team.<ref name="X-Treme X-Men #10 April 2002">''X-Treme X-Men'' #10 (April 2002)</ref> Her brother, unable to see past her new, alien appearance, leaves the team.  Lifeguard and Thunderbird travel in search of him.<ref name="X-Treme X-Men #19 December 2002">''X-Treme X-Men'' #19 (Dec. 2002)</ref>

===The Xavier Institute===
Months later, Lifeguard and Thunderbird returned to the X-Men, apparently not locating Slipstream. Together with Thunderbird, she joined the [[X-Corporation]]. However this only lasted weeks, as there was a synchronized attack on several of the X-Corporation offices after the catastrophic events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], leading [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to call for the disbanding of all offices.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Heather is one of a handful of mutants to have retained her powers in the wake of [[House of M]]. Still involved with Thunderbird III, she was not active in any X-Men roster, though the ''198 Files'' verified her location as residing at the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]].

===Utopia===
Heather later resurfaces after the events of Schism as a member of Cyclops' street team with Boom Boom and Dazzler in San Francisco and [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Heather's mutant power allows her body to sense and react to any threat by transforming or manifesting a power to deal with the situation (similar to that of the X-Men's [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]]).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Collura |first=Scott |date=2015-01-16 |title=Every X-Man Ever |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/16/every-x-man-ever |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Glapion |first=Chad |date=2021-03-29 |title=Marvel's Most Powerful X-Men Members That Time Forgot |url=https://screenrant.com/most-powerful-xmen-forgotten-lifeguard-ariel-gaia-forgetmenot/ |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=published |first=Jason Wiese |date=2022-02-14 |title=5 Marvel Characters Lily James Would Be Perfect To Play |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/superheroes/marvel-cinematic-universe/marvel-characters-lily-james-would-be-perfect-to-play |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=CINEMABLEND |language=en}}</ref> In all of her appearances, she has only been shown to use this ability while defending herself and others.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #9</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Thompson |first=Jonathan |date=2018-11-25 |title=Freaks And Geeks: The 20 Weirdest Mutants To Ever Be X-Men |url=https://www.cbr.com/weirdest-x-men-members/ |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> It is as yet unknown if she is able to use this ability for her own protection.

In her most recent appearance with the emergence of her inherent Shi'ar genome, she appeared to be locked into her final transformation of gold skin, wings, and claws, still unable to control her powers and possibly unable to transform any further or reverse the change.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shayo |first=Lukas |date=2022-06-03 |title=X-Men: Synch & 9 Other Mutants Who Could Become Omega Level |url=https://screenrant.com/x-men-mutants-could-become-omega-level/ |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Harn |first=Darby |date=2021-01-16 |title=10 Mutants Everyone Forgets Used To Be In The X-Men |url=https://www.cbr.com/xmen-mutants-everyone-forgets/ |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Lukas Shayo of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' stated, "A mutant with the power to save lives, the aptly named Lifeguard can develop any ability necessary to save any life, be it her own or another's. If that means turning into metal, growing wings, or shapeshifting, Lifeguard will develop that power and subsequently save a life. As what essentially amounts to a stronger version of Darwin, Lifeguard doesn't really get the reputation she deserves. No mutant can ever surpass her ability to save lives, as their mutations are often tailored to other specific niches. With no upper limit to determine how she can shift, Lifeguard deserves her place among the Omega-levels."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shayo |first=Lukas |date=2022-06-03 |title=X-Men: Synch & 9 Other Mutants Who Could Become Omega Level |url=https://screenrant.com/x-men-mutants-could-become-omega-level/ |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>
