Sir, does this mailman belong to you? There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it. We'll send a bill for the damages,  Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus. Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.  This is South Park Police! We know the truth, Dr. Janus! He's not Chinese! He's white!  Your name is Dr. Janus! That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters.   does the world really need another therapist? Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town. Done! Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant.
