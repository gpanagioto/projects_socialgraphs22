'''Jack O'Lantern''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Daniel Cormac===
The first Jack O'Lantern is '''Daniel Cormac''' of [[Ireland]], who was born to a poor [[farmer]] who was granted a magic lantern by an Irish fairy. Cormac is a member of the [[Global Guardians]], an international group of superheroes.<ref name="dc-glob">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Global Guardians | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 138 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> His first recorded mission in ''Super Friends'' #8 was to help [[Green Lantern]] dismantle a bomb in Ireland.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=156}}</ref> He appears in three solo back up stories in ''Super Friends'' issues #37, #40 and #44. 

Cormac's first appearance in the mainstream DC Comics universe is ''DC Comics Presents'' #46, helping [[Superman]] find an ancient ruin in Ireland. He is later seen as part of a group of  heroes from Ireland and England trying to save the world in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.  

When the [[United Nations]] decide to fund the [[Justice League International]], the Global Guardians find themselves without financial support, and disband. Cormac subsequently joins Rumaan Harjavti's army in Bialya.<ref>''Justice League International'' #8, #9, #16, #17 and #27.</ref> After Harjavti is killed by the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], Jack voluntarily joins forces with the villainess in taking over the world. He is left dying in a sewer after a battle with the Justice League.<ref>''Captain Atom Annual'' #2, ''Justice League Europe'' #2-4.</ref> He is found alive by his girlfriend [[Owlwoman]] in ''Justice League Quarterly'' issues #6 - #8 when the two heroes are found by [[Doctor Mist]]. They take a major part in reuniting the Global Guardians and fight with [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]] against the Justice League in ''Justice League Europe'' issues #49 and #50. Afterwards, Jack dies of natural causes.<ref>Revealed in ''Primal Force'' #0.</ref>

===Marvin Noronsa===
'''Marvin Noronsa''' is a native of Bialya who takes over the Jack O'Lantern identity at Queen Bee's behest. Noronsa is able to use Cormac's mystical lantern only after Queen Bee modifies it.<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #29-30; ''Justice League'' #53 - 55.</ref> Noronsa is killed in an explosion caused by Sumaan Harjavti in ''Justice League America'' #55 (October 1991).

===Liam McHugh===
More recently, Cormac's cousin '''Liam McHugh''' takes up the mantle of Jack O'Lantern. An Irish [[freedom fighter]] who wields a mystical jack o'lantern and is blessed with incredible agility, McHugh has fought evil in various arenas over the past few years. He was a member of the Leymen (Primal Force) and later joined the Ultramarine Corps in Superbia. He appears in three solo stories in ''Justice League Quarterly'' #14, 15 and 17. He became a member of Dr. Mist's Leymen in ''[[Primal Force]]'' #0, appearing in every issue until the book was cancelled with issue #14. Liam is last seen as a member of the [[Ultramarine Corps]] in ''JLA'' #26 and ''JLA Classified'' #1-3.

==Powers and abilities==
Daniel Cormac and Marvin Noronsa have a mystical lantern that gives them the power of flight, flame projection, teleportation, illusion casting, enhanced strength, and the ability to create fogs.  The power of the lantern is at its weakest at noon, and gradually increases to its peak at midnight.  

Liam McHugh has found a way to internalize the powers of the mystical lantern, and no longer needs to carry it.
