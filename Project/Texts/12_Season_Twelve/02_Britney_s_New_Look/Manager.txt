Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this. Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.  Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away. All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it. Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be "love elation". Sounds more like you're saying "love creation". E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L. Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway? She must be back at the train station; come on!   It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great. The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
