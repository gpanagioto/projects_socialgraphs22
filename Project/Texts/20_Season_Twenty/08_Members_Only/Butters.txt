Hey, Eric!  Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number.  No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse. Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too. No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect. Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie ''9 to 5'' with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton? Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great. Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time.  Hey, that's me too. Yippee! Mr. Musk, wait!
