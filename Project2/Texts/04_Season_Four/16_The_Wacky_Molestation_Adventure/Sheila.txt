No, Kyle. Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile. Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can ''go'' to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba! The whole thing. No you can't! We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert. Kyle! Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that. Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them? Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!! Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long! Oh, it's awful! Just awful. Kids!   It won't happen again.
