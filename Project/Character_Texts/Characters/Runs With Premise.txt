Halt.  I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor. You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.  Awww, I think I'm going to cwy. What are they doing? Impossible! Thirty one. Black.  No... NOOO!   Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!  A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino!  Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits. Well like what? Get out of our way. Boys. It isn't your town anymore. Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with! This isn't over!  What is the state of our people? Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land. I already have a plan how we can force them off their land... sneakily.  Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS.  Okay, bring them in!    Though I know we have differences, we believe that a compromise can be reached. In the meantime, it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold. Will you not take this offering as a gesture of good-will?  Please. As a token of good faith. It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh. Oh. You're welcome. How much longer must we wait for our superhighway?? Then I suppose we must be patient. What is the matter, wife? Premise Running Thin, what is the matter? No! I told you not to touch them! This would not have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe! Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth!  Your, your SARS. Where did it go? My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well.  You... you can cure him? You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino.  All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back.
