'''Kamala Khan''' is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; superheroes (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[superheroine]] who appears in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by editors [[Sana Amanat]] and Stephen Wacker, writer [[G. Willow Wilson]], and artists [[Adrian Alphona]] and [[Jamie McKelvie]], Kamala is Marvel's first [[Muslims|Muslim]] character and [[South Asian American]] personality with her own comic book. She made her first appearance in ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #14 (August 2013) before starring in the solo series ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'', which debuted in February 2014.

In the [[Marvel Universe]], Kamala is a teenage [[Pakistani Americans|Pakistani-American]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] with body-morphing abilities who discovers that she has [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] genes in the aftermath of the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline. She assumes the mantle of [[Ms. Marvel]] from her [[Teen idol|idol]], [[Carol Danvers]], after Danvers becomes Captain Marvel. Marvel's announcement that a Muslim character would headline a comic book attracted widespread attention, and the first volume of ''Ms. Marvel'' won the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|best graphic story]] in 2015.

[[Iman Vellani]] plays [[Kamala Khan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]'' (2022), and is scheduled to reprise the role in the film ''[[The Marvels]]'' (2023).

She was voiced by Sandra Saad in the video game ''[[Marvel's Avengers (video game)|Marvel's Avengers]]'' (2020) and the animated series ''[[Spidey and His Amazing Friends (2021 TV series)|Spidey and His Amazing Friends]]'' (2021).

==Overview==
=== Creative origins ===
[[Marvel Comics]] announced in November 2013 that Kamala Khan, a teenage American Muslim from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], would take over the comic-book series ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' in February 2014. The series, written by [[G. Willow Wilson]] and drawn by [[Adrian Alphona]], marked the first time a Muslim character headlined a Marvel Comics book.<ref name="Marvel">{{cite web |last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |date=November 6, 2013|title=All-New Marvel NOW!

Marvel wanted a young Muslim girl, saying that she could be from anywhere and have any background. Wilson initially considered making her an [[Arabs|Arab]] girl from [[Dearborn, Michigan]], but ultimately made her a [[Desi]] girl from Jersey City.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ali |first=Dilshad D. |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/altmuslim/2013/11/interview-g-willow-wilson-on-the-creation-of-the-newest-muslim-american-comic-superhero/ |title=Interview: G.

Wilson said, "A huge aspect of Ms. Marvel is being a 'second string hero' in the 'second string city' and having to struggle out of the pathos and emotion that can give a person".<ref name="Newsarama"/>

The series explores Kamala's conflicts with supervillains and her domestic and religious duties. Wilson, a convert to Islam, said: "This is not evangelism. It was really important for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith&nbsp;... Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor".<ref name="NYTimes" /> Amanat said, 

<blockquote>As much as Islam is a part of Kamala's identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.<ref name="Marvel" /></blockquote>

=== Powers and abilities ===
Kamala develops her superpowers after Marvel's [[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]] storyline, when the [[Terrigen Mists]] are released. Her dormant [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] abilities are activated by the mists on a rare night when she rebelliously decides to sneak out after her parents forbid her from attending a school party.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |last=Knox |first=Kelly |date=November 12, 2021 |title=Ms. Marvel in the MCU: Kamala Khan's Comics Origin and Powers Explained |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/ms-marvel-explained-who-is-kamala-khan |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> Amanat said in 2022 that when she and Wilson were creating Kamala, the character was originally going to be a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] before they changed her to an Inhuman.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Travis |first=Ben |date=July 14, 2022 |title=Ms. Marvel's Creators Originally Wanted Her To Be A (REDACTED) In The Comics Too – Exclusive |url=https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/ms-marvel-finale-reveal-sana-amanat-interview-exclusive/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220714214149/https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/ms-marvel-finale-reveal-sana-amanat-interview-exclusive/ |archive-date=July 14, 2022 |access-date=July 15, 2022 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]}}</ref> ''[[Screen Rant]]'' noted that Kamala is a "polymorph", with moves which "are basically [[Ant-Man]] and [[Mister Fantastic]]'s combined".<ref name=":5">{{cite web |date=August 25, 2019 |title=Ms. Marvel Character, Powers and Origins Explained |url=https://screenrant.com/ms-marvel-character-powers-origin-explained/ |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> According to academic Sarah Gibbons, Kamala's body-morphing is paralleled by the flexibility required of the characters who live in Jersey City; her unusual, superpowered body shape conveys a non-conforming message.<ref>{{citation |last=Gibbons |first=Sarah |title='I Don't Exactly Have Quiet, Pretty Powers': Flexibility and Alterity in Ms. Marvel. |date=Oct 2017 |journal=Journal of Graphic Novels & Comics |volume=8 |number=5 |pages=450–463 |doi=10.1080/21504857.2017.1355834 |s2cid=193822282}}</ref>

Her best-known power is elongation, which allows her to extend her limbs, torso, or neck great distances. Kamala's other powers include the ability to alter her size, shrinking and enlarging herself.<ref name=":6">{{cite web |date=July 31, 2019 |title=Ms. Marvel: All Of Kamala Khan's Powers & Abilities, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-all-of-kamala-khans-powers-abilities-ranked/ |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":4" /> When she enlarges, she can lift up to 75 tons.

Asked about Kamala's transition from comic book to live action in 2019, Wilson said: "I think there're some characters who are very much set up for the big screen; they're very naturally sort of cinematic. But with Ms. Marvel, we really weren't interested in creating something that had very obvious film potential&nbsp;[...] She's got very comic booky powers.

Kamala is the daughter of Yusuf and Muneeba Khan, and the younger sister of Aamir Khan. She takes the name Ms. Marvel from Carol Danvers, who is now known as Captain Marvel. ''Captain Marvel'' writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] said that Kamala made a brief appearance in ''Captain Marvel'' #14 (August 2013): "Kamala is in the background of a scene in ''Captain Marvel'' 14&nbsp;... She is very deliberately placed in a position where she sees Carol protecting civilians from [[Yon-Rogg]]".<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Thompson |first=Kelly |date=November 18, 2013 |title=3 Chicks Review Comics – Episode 064 | medium=[[Podcast]] |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/11/18/3-chicks-review-comics-episode-064/ |access-date=December 6, 2013 |format=[[MP3]] |time =1:37:40 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> According to co-creator G.

She opposes Mr. Edison (the Inventor), a clone of [[Thomas Edison]] tainted with the DNA of Mr. Knox's pet [[cockatiel]], in the series' first story arc. Wilson created the Inventor as Kamala's first archrival to mirror her complexity. She characterized the Inventor and the overall look of the opening story arc as "kooky and almost [[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]-esque at times" due to the style of illustrator [[Adrian Alphona]], which balances the drama of the threats faced by Kamala with the humor of Alphona's "tongue in cheek sight gags". During the story line, Khan also [[team-up|teams up]] with the X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] against the Inventor. Because Wolverine is dealing with the [[Death of Wolverine|loss of his healing factor]] during this time, Khan is placed in the position of having to shoulder much of the responsibilities since Wilson felt this was a role reversal that would subvert reader expectations that Wolverine would take the lead in such a team-up.<ref>{{cite web |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=July 16, 2014 |title=Heroic Identity of Wilson's "Ms. Marvel" Continues To Take Shape |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54112 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=March 18, 2015}}{{dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref>

At the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], writer [[Dan Slott]] announced that Kamala would join [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #7 (October 2014) during the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline. Slott characterized Kamala as "the closest character to classic Peter Parker":<ref>{{cite web |last=Manning |first=Shaun |date=July 25, 2014 |title=SDCC: Across the Spider-Verse |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54330 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=October 8, 2014}}</ref> "She's a teenage superhero, juggling her life, making mistakes, trying to do everything right".<ref>{{cite web |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=October 12, 2014 |title=NYCC: Marvel's "Spider-Verse" Panel, "Spider-Gwen" and "Silk" Ongoings Announced |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=56244 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref>

''Ms. Marvel'' tied into the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover event]] with the "Last Days" storyline in June 2015, which details Kamala's account of the end of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Wilson said, "In the 'Last Days' story arc, Kamala has to grapple with the end of everything she knows, and discover what it means to be a hero when your whole world is on the line".<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 19, 2015 |title="Ms. Marvel," "Silver Surfer" and More Face Their Last Days |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=59452 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> Kamala rushes to deal with the threat in Manhattan and, according to Wilson, "She will face a very personal enemy as the chaos in Manhattan spills over into Jersey City, and she will be forced to make some very difficult choices.

=== Volume two (2015–2018) ===

Marvel announced in March 2015 that Kamala would join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''All-New All-Different Avengers'' [[Free Comic Book Day|FCBD]] (May 2015) by writer [[Mark Waid]] and artists [[Adam Kubert]] and [[Mahmud Asrar]], which takes place in the aftermath of "Secret Wars".<ref>{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=March 24, 2015 |title=MARVEL Begins To Unveil ALL-NEW ALL-DIFFERENT AVENGERS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/23888-marvel-begins-to-unveil-all-new-all-different-avengers-title-for-fcbd.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |access-date=March 24, 2015}}</ref> A second volume of ''Ms. Marvel'', starring Kamala, by Wilson, Alphona and [[Takeshi Miyazawa]] also debuted after "Secret Wars" as part of Marvel's [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/marvel-just-revealed-its-entire-all-new-all-different-1714899675|title=Marvel Just Revealed Its Entire "All-New, All-Different" Comic Universe|publisher=[[Io9]]|date=June 30, 2015|access-date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Amanat said, <blockquote>By the time this new launch comes around, it will have been almost two years since the premiere of ''Ms. Marvel''—and boy, has Kamala Khan been through a lot since then. She's been slowly coming into her own, dealing with the challenges of navigating adulthood and being a super hero.

Marvel announced in July 2016 that Kamala would join the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]], a team of teenage superheroes who leave the Avengers after the conclusion of "Civil War II".

Waid said, "The first three are the kids who quit the Avengers proper. That was an easy get. Those three, in and of themselves, form a nice little subteam. Their dynamic is great.

==Reception==
===Cultural reaction===
Kamala's announcement by Marvel had a widespread online reaction. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of ''Muslimah Media Watch'' (a diversity [[advocacy group]]), told [[Al Jazeera America]] that "she is going to be a window into the American Muslim experience" and she "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim".<ref>{{cite news |last=De Bode |first=Lisa |date=November 5, 2013 |title=Ms. Marvel returns as Muslim teen |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/5/ms-marvel-returnsasmuslimteen.html |work=[[Al Jazeera America]] |access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Brett White of [[Comic Book Resources]] said, "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes".<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Brett |date=November 6, 2013 |title=In Your Face Jam: Ms. Marvel Is Important |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48963 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Hussein Rashid, writing for [[CNN]], said: "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims.

Leon Moosavi of the [[University of Liverpool]] felt that the character's family would reinforce the stereotype of restrictive Muslim parents, and her shape-shifting ability resembled several anti-Muslim stereotypes (especially [[taqiyya]]:<ref>{{cite news |last=Moosavi |first=Leon |date=November 27, 2013 |title=Why can't Spider-Man convert to Islam? |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/why-can-spiderman-convert-islam-20131122115933370663.html |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |access-date=November 29, 2013}}</ref> a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny their faith or commit illegal or blasphemous acts while at risk of significant persecution).<ref name="StewartNYUEssay">{{cite web |title=Islam in Spain after the Reconquista |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/program/neareast/test/andalusia/2_p8_text.html |first=Devin |last=Stewart |work=Teaching Materials |publisher=The Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at [[New York University]] |access-date=August 6, 2012}}</ref> Political satirist [[Stephen Colbert]], parodying right-wing commentators on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', said: "A Muslim cannot be a superhero — for Pete's sake they're on the no-fly list".<ref>{{cite news |last=Maglio |first=Tony |date=November 7, 2013 |title=Stephen Colbert on New Ms. Marvel: 'Muslim Cannot Be a Superhero ...

On top of that, we were represented in the Marvel Universe, and I thought that was really cool, because it's a big company."<ref name=HudsonReporter/>

===Critical reaction===
==== 2014–2018 ====
Meagan Damore of ''Comic Book Resources'' said, "There is nothing not to love about ''Ms. Marvel'' #1: every character is well formed and distinct; the story, lovingly crafted; the art, meticulously planned and—at times—downright funny".<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=6953 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=February 6, 2014}}</ref> Jen Aprahamian of ''[[Comic Vine]]'' said, "''Ms. Marvel'' makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart even before she puts on a mask. Kamala is not your average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction. Kudos to Marvel for expanding its range; amping up the diversity factor in a way that doesn't feel token or temporary is a great move, and Ms. Marvel is launching with a solid first issue and a world—a universe, even—of story possibilities".<ref>{{cite web |last=Aprahamian |first=Jen |date=February 4, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 Review |url=http://www.comicvine.com/reviews/ms-marvel-1/1900-2673/ |publisher=[[Comic Vine]] |access-date=February 5, 2014}}</ref> Joshua Yehl of ''[[IGN]]'' said, "''Ms. Marvel'' introduces a vibrant and troubled character that you can't help but love".<ref>{{cite web |last=Yehl |first=Joshua |date=February 5, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/05/ms-marvel-1-review-2 |publisher=IGN |access-date=February 6, 2014}}</ref> George Marston of ''[[Newsarama]]'' said, "''Ms. Marvel'' is a solid debut issue, and that in itself should be a victory not just for G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona, but for Marvel Comics itself&nbsp;... It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, but Ms. Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has had in a long time".<ref>{{cite web |last=Marston |first=George |date=February 3, 2014 |title=Best Shots Advance Reviews: MS.

In 2016, ''[[USA Today]]'' said that Kamala "broke onto the comics scene a few years ago and has since stolen awards, sales and, oh right, our hearts. Her solo comics, written by G. Willow Wilson, are entertaining and fly off the page, and her appearances elsewhere have only increased".<ref>{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Kelly |date=April 28, 2016 |title=Happy #NationalSuperheroDay! 5 female superheroes you should be obsessed with |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/28/national-superhero-day-5-female-superheroes-to-know-ms-captain-marvel-batgirl/83641686/ |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref> Alex Abad-Santos, for ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'', wrote that "Wilson and Alphona imbue the comic with grace while steering clear of 'after-school special'-of-the-month types of stories&nbsp;[...] As you see Kamala slowly figure out the ways of superheroism and the balance of her own life, you can't help but feel like she represents an alternate path that can save us from the ugly stuff threatening to strangle our hope, our joy, and our love. That's why superheroes were first created, and it's why Ms. Marvel is one of the greatest heroes of our generation".<ref>{{cite web |last=Abad-Santos |first=Alex |date=March 4, 2016 |title=Ms. Marvel: the generation-defining hero we need |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/3/4/18052662/ms-marvel-comic-book-review |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=Vox |language=en}}</ref>

Katie M. Logan, for ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' in 2017, said that Kamala "signals an important development in cultural representations of Muslim-Americans&nbsp;[...] Kamala Khan is precisely the hero America needs today, but not because of a bat sign in the sky or any single definitive image. She is, above all, committed to the idea that every member of her faith, her generation and her city has value and that their lives should be respected and protected".<ref>{{cite web |last=Logan |first=Katie M. |date=February 19, 2017 |title=Muslim journey to superheroism: Why America needs Marvel superhero Kamala Khan now more than ever |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/02/19/why-america-needs-marvel-superhero-kamala-khan-now-more-than-ever_partner/ |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=Salon |language=en}}</ref> Joshua Davison, ''for [[Bleeding Cool]]'' in 2018, wrote that "''Ms. Marvel #31'' is the landmark 50th issue of Kamala's beloved series. G. Willow Wilson never ceases to amaze me at how she can have me invested in mundane activities like a sleepover. This is done through a good balance of endearing characters, solid drama, and the quirks and detours one can expect from a superhero comic&nbsp;[...] Mix that with some talented artists, and you have a book well worth recommending".<ref>{{cite web |last=Davison |first=Joshua |date=June 28, 2018 |title=Ms. Marvel #31 Review: Slumber Party Spectacular - Bleeding Cool |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/ms-marvel-31-review-slumber-party/ |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors |language=en}}</ref> In a 2018 review of the series, the ''Wisconsin Muslim Journal'' said that the story "is a rare burst of authenticity in what can so easily become clichéd and cheap. In short, Kamala Khan has a refreshing amount of depth".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=November 23, 2018 |title=IRC Book Review: Ms. Marvel series |url=https://wisconsinmuslimjournal.org/irc-book-review-ms-marvel-series/ |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=Wisconsin Muslim Journal |language=en-US}}</ref>

Ridgely said, "Ahmed has leaned hard into the issues that plague our current lives while still making the comic uplifting", and "every revelation that Kamala comes to is thoroughly earned and formed based on the specific experiences we see her confront. It's a master class in evolving a character while keeping them grounded in their own identity".<ref>{{cite web |date=February 24, 2021 |title=The Magnificent Ms. Marvel #18 Review: A Most Magnificent Finale |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/magnificent-ms-marvel-18-review-finale-saladin-ahmed/ |access-date=May 8, 2022 |website=[[ComicBook.com]] |language=en}}</ref>

Avery Kaplan, in her review of ''Ms. Marvel: Beyond the Limit'' for ''[[Heidi MacDonald|The Beat]]'', wrote: "''Beyond the Limit'' was a fun and interesting story that went to some unexpected places, all while allowing Kamala plenty of time to shine (and to make a lot of funny food jokes)".<ref name=":7">{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Avery |date=April 27, 2022 |title=THE MARVEL RUNDOWN: Interdimensional hanger in MS.

It landed at 109 out of the top 300 comics for the month. But the series is known to be doing well digitally and with collected editions. There are also other signs of prestige. This week, a collected edition of the series, 'Ms. Marvel: Super Famous,' written by G. Willow Wilson and illustrated by Takeshi Miyazawa, was nominated for a Hugo Award, which is given to the best science-fiction or fantasy stories".<ref name=":8" /> Later that year, during [[Marvel Legacy|Marvel's Legacy initiative]], many titles featuring "diverse and new voices" were cancelled.<ref name=":10">{{cite web |last=Glass |first=Joe |date=December 21, 2017 |title=On the Victims of the Marvel Cancellation Bloodbath |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/victims-marvel-cancellation-bloodbath/ |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors |language=en}}</ref> On the survival of the series, Joe Glass of ''Bleeding Cool'' wrote that ''Ms. Marvel''{{'s}} periodical sales were only slightly higher than many of the cancelled titles; however, "it could be down to trades sales. It is generally held that these books survive on the popularity of their trades sales, not just in the direct market and local comic shops, but in book stores across the world" and at "[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] [book] fairs and the like".<ref name=":10" /> Associate professor at [[Northumbria University]] and comics scholar Mel Gibson said that ''Ms. Marvel'' "absolutely leapt in sales to what could be considered non-traditional comic book readers – such as females, Muslims, or Pakistani-Americans for example. The idea of who reads comics and how they read them was changing. It helped draw in new folk and diversify the fan base".<ref name=":15" />

In January 2015, images of Kamala began appearing over anti-Islamic advertisements on San Francisco city buses. The advertisements, purchased by the [[Stop Islamization of America|American Freedom Defense Initiative]], equated Islam with [[Nazism]]. Street artists covered the ads with images of Kamala and messages such as "Calling all Bigotry Busters", "Stamp out racism", "Free speech isn't a license to spread hate", "Islamophobia hurts us all", and "Racist". About the response, Wilson tweeted, "Some amazing person has been painting over the anti-Muslim bus ads in SF with Ms. Marvel graffiti&nbsp;... To me, the graffiti is part of the back-and-forth of the free speech conversation. Call and response. Argument, counterargument".<ref>{{cite news |last=Kai-Hwa Wang |first=Frances |date=January 27, 2015 |title=Comic Heroine Ms. Marvel Saves San Francisco From Anti-Islam Ads |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/comic-heroine-ms-marvel-saves-san-francisco-anti-islam-ads-n294751 |work=[[NBC News]] |access-date=March 18, 2016}}</ref>

Sana Amanat was introduced to United States President [[Barack Obama]] at a March 2016 reception celebrating [[Women's History Month]] at the [[White House]]. In his opening remarks, Obama said: "Ms. Marvel may be your comic book creation, but I think for a lot of young boys and girls, Sana's a real superhero".<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Tracy |date=March 16, 2016 |title=President Obama meets Ms. Marvel |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-president-obama-meets-ms-marvel-20160316-story.html |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=March 17, 2016}}</ref>

Kamala appeared on the cover of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in an October 2016 illustration by [[Autumn Whitehearst]] which paid homage to J. Howard Miller's "[[We Can Do It!]]" poster. The cover was accompanied by "The Super Hero For Our Times: Ms. Marvel Will Save You Now", an article by Mallika Rao which profiled Wilson and focused on the increasing diversity of comic-book characters, creators, and fans.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cave |first=Rob |date=October 6, 2016 |title=Ms Marvel Becomes Village Voice Cover Star |url=http://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-becomes-village-voice-cover-star/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=October 6, 2016}}</ref>

In March 2018, [[Merriam-Webster]] added 850 words to its dictionary. This included the word "Embiggen", which first appeared in a 1996 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and was popularized in ''Ms. Marvel'' as an exclamation by Kamala when using her shape-shifting powers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carter |first=Justin |date=March 5, 2018 |title=Merriam-Webster Declares Ms. Marvel's 'Embiggen' Is a Real Word |url=https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-embiggen-merriam-webster/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=March 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/dictionary-merriam-webster-ms-marvel-muslim-avenger-kamala-khan-830867|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary Adds 850 New Words, Including Ms. Marvel's Catchphrase|date=March 5, 2018|last=Gaudette|first=Emily|work=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>

==Other versions==
An older version of Kamala appears in ''[[Inhumans|Inhumans: Attilan Rising]]'' by [[Charles Soule]] and John Timms as part of the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, which details [[Black Bolt]]'s rebellion against [[Medusa (comics)|Queen Medusa]] of [[Features of the Marvel Universe|New Attilan]]. In her review of ''Inhumans: Attilan Rising'' #2, Emma Houxbois of The Rainbow Hub said: "While [Kamala has] had a few chances to shine in the core ''Inhuman'' book, her reintroduction (complete with character redesign by Dave Johnson and strong line work by John Timms) packs a real punch. Soule's evolution of her powers and costume will hopefully also coincide with further opportunities later in the story to learn more about her views on the resistance and reasons for supporting Attilan – solidifying this version of Kamala as a comparatively matured hero forced to make difficult moral choices".<ref>{{cite web |last=Houxbois |first=Emma |date=June 13, 2015 |title=Attilan Rising #2: Review |url=http://www.therainbowhub.com/attilan-rising-2-review/ |publisher=The Rainbow Hub |access-date=July 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716075307/http://www.therainbowhub.com/attilan-rising-2-review/ |archive-date=July 16, 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

A future version of Kamala appears as a member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] with [[Nick Fury]], [[Blink (character)|Blink]], [[Iron Lad]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and a [[Chibi (slang)|chibi-style]] cartoon version of Wolverine in a series by writer [[Saladin Ahmed]] and artist [[Javier Rodríguez (artist)|Javier Rodriguez]] which debuted in April 2018.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marston |first=George |date=January 3, 2018 |title=EXILES Return With NICK FURY Sr., BLINK, IRON LAD, More |url=https://www.newsarama.com/38029-exiles-returns-with-nick-fury-blink-and-iron-lad-for-new-series.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |access-date=January 3, 2018}}</ref> Another future version of the character appears in ''[[All-New Wolverine]]'' #33 (April 2018) by [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Tom Taylor]] and Ramon Rosanas as part of the "Old Woman Laura" storyline as the future [[President of the United States]]. Kieran Shiach of Comic Book Resources said, "Kamala as President of the United States makes a lot of sense. She's smart, resourceful and cares about her community&nbsp;... It also helps solidify the world of 'Old Woman Laura' as a 'good future,' presenting a President who is both a woman and Muslim as a possibility within our lifetime".<ref>{{cite web |last=Shiach |first=Kieran |date=April 6, 2018 |title=Wolverine's 'Old Woman Laura' Introduces A Familiar, Superheroic President |url=https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-president-ms-marvel-kamala-khan/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=April 18, 2018}}</ref>
