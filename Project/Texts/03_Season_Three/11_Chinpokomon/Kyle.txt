 What are those? Huh? No, but look. I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll. Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore? Why the hell don't people tell me these things?! What's the Primary Main Objective? Well, what's the Evil Power? What?  Shit!  Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon? I'm not sure. I don't know. Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon. Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass. Thanks. Neither do I.   Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll! What?  Huh? No. Damnit!   Camp?   Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight? What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen? God damnit!  ...our hearts.  ...Power. Destroy it? Liberace gay. Owatta Beikoku!  But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master! What? Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master! So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't? But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya.  Aw, screw it; I'm too confused.  Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
