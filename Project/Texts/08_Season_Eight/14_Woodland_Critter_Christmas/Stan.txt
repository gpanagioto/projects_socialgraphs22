 What the hell? It's... nice. Okay, okay.  Woof. Oh, whatta?   What time is it?!  You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow. ...What?  Go away! Shoo!  Again? Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!  Okay, there.    Aw- awww! It's dead. I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore. Wait, wha-what? Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior! But I thought you meant the Son of God! Ugh. Uuugh!  No, no-no-no. Leave me ''alone''!! All right, all right, all right! God!  I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian! No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this! Right, whatever.  Oh yeah. Hello? Anybody in there?  Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil. I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion! Well, you're mountain lions. There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.  What?! No, he didn't. No, he didn't! No, he didn't! Oh, Goddammit!  I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous. This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point. Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born? Too late?! The hell is that?! It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!  I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them! Dude, what the- ?   What?! Kyle?! Dude! No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner. Well, after all that, I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth. Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil. No Santa, don't! The lion cubs! I took them to see how abortions are done.  Yeah. Yeah, there is.  Oh, good.
