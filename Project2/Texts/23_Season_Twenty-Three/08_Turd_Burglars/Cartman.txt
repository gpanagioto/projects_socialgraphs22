So?  Fecal transplant! Whaaat? Yes! Kyle! What is your problem?! Okay, we've got contact. Are you ready with the bucket, Kenny? Place it directly under this pipe.  Now we just wait. For the flush. That's good she's not flushing yet. That means she's got more serious business, and serious business is just what we're after. You see how fat Kyle's mom is? That bitch must poop at least two-pounders. Oh, hey Kyle, What's going on? Kyle, this is the world we're living in, okay? People are finding new and exciting ways to get healthy, and who are we to stand in their way?  That is 100% untrue. Very nice, very nice. Wouldn't know. Whose? [pats Stan on the shoulder] It's all right, Stan. Don't cry. You see, ma'am, our little friend Kenny here is dying, and he's... he's just the biggest Patriots fan. Kind of, like a Michael Jackson kind of thing. [Kenny mumbles something] Oh gosh, we're losin' him! We need to make this happen quickly, ma'am. Uh, ma'am? Hello, ma'am. We are the darling children whose dying friend is all set to meet Tom Brady. [thinking, "I wonder why everyone keeps taking really long pauses after they talk."] Mr. Brady, can we just see your basement really fast? You don't get to be part of Turd Burglars now, Kyle!
