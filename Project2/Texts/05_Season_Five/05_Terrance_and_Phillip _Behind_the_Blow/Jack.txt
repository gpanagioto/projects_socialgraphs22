Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it.  Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action! Boys, you've got... three hours to get those two back together. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't? Carl!  Good luck, boys.   Republicans are ruining the earth. Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?!  We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys!  Think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you! Carl!  So long, boys!  Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!
