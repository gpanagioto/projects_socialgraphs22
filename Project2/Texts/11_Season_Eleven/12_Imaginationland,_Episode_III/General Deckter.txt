We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild. By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination. We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters! Thank you. All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books. What?! Sector 2?  What? All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand! Prepare for launch... What?! Sector 2?  The hell are you doing back here?! Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?! If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do ''you'' care what happens? Abort the sequence.  There's been an abort, Mr. Gore. That's true. You did.
