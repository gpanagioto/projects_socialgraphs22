'''Professor Pyg''' is a [[supervillain]] who appears in comic books published by [[DC Comics]], commonly known as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. Pyg was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Andy Kubert]] and debuted as a corpse in the [[DC Multiverse|alternate reality]] story ''[[Batman (comic book)#2006–2009|Batman]]'' #666 (July 2007) before being introduced as a recurring character in the mainstream [[DC Universe]] two years later in ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)#Batman Reborn (Issues 1-3)|Batman and Robin]]'' #1 (June 2009).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=238}}</ref> Professor Pyg was re-introduced following DC's [[The New 52]] comics relaunch in 2011, appearing throughout the continuity and the subsequent [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch that began in 2016.

The character's in-world real name is '''Lazlo Valentin''', a scientist who suffered a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] breakdown that led him to become a supervillain who wears a pig mask. Morrison intended Pyg to seem disconnected from reality, believing him to be one of the "weirdest, most insane" characters in [[List of Batman comics|''Batman'' comic books]]. Pyg is an obsessive perfectionist who sees human beings as broken individuals; he commonly kidnaps people and uses surgery and chemicals to permanently change them into mind-controlled automatons known as Dollotrons, and sometimes into [[human–animal hybrid]]s.

Morrison took the name "Professor Pyg" from the song "Pygmalism" by [[Momus (musician)|Momus]] and [[Kahimi Karie]]; the name "Pyg" is also shorthand for "Pygmalion", referring to both the [[Pygmalion (mythology)|mythical sculptor]] who fell in love with his own creation and the [[Pygmalion (play)|1913 stage play]], both of which serve as parallels for Lazlo Valentin and his love for his Dollotron creations. The character's [[origin story]] alludes to real-life [[animal testing]] carried out in the mid-twentieth century. He has a makeshift mother made of nails and boards, from which he associates [[auditory hallucination]]s commanding him to constantly improve his surgical work.

Pyg began making substantial appearances in other media in 2013 with the animated series ''[[Beware the Batman]]'' and has since appeared in video games, television, and film. The character has been positively received by entertainment journalists as a strange and disturbing addition to [[List of Batman family enemies|Batman's rogues gallery]].

{{Further|Final Crisis#Plot|Batman: Battle for the Cowl}}

===Debut in other media===

Professor Pyg, voiced by [[Brian George]], became a recurring villain in the 2013 animated series ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', which was intended to focus on lesser-known members of Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues' gallery]] to set it apart from previous ''Batman'' television shows. He appears alongside Mister Toad ([[Udo Kier]]), a humanoid toad, as eco-terrorists who hunt people for what they deem to be crimes against the animal kingdom.

==Characterization and symbolism==
{{Quote box
|quote = "Like the Pygmalion of myth, Lazlo fancies himself something of a sculptor—except he doesn't work in clay or marble, he's much more fascinated with transforming living human bodies... He has no real rhyme or reason for his crime. He's really only motivated by his art—there's no vendetta or plan or higher purpose. Pyg doesn't follow a pattern or even build up to a punchline. He's not really angling for pure chaos like the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], but he's also not systematic like [[Victor Zsasz]]. He just wants to spread his own twisted idea of "perfection" in his work, no matter the cost."

Professor Pyg is usually characterized in comic books as someone who is suffering from severe mental illness. Cocreator Grant Morrison envisioned him as "one of the weirdest, most insane characters that's ever been in Batman [comics]" and said, "We hear a lot about Batman facing crazy villains but we tried to make this guy seem genuinely disturbed and disconnected&nbsp;... Professor Pyg isn't from another world; he's from here, but he's very, very sick". Taking inspiration from the works of [[David Lynch]], Morrison wanted the visuals in ''Batman Reborn'', illustrated by [[Frank Quitely]], to feel like a real world crossing over with a world of [[schizophrenia]], [[paranoia]], and the use of narcotics. They've stated that when Batman and Robin are facing Pyg and his Dollotrons, they are dealing with "the eerie, creepy, mentally-ill dark corners of life".<ref name="IGNB&R" /> The character uses drugs, [[lobotomy]], and doll masks permanently molded onto people's faces to turn them into genderless Dollotrons, which he believes are perfected human beings.<ref name="RantExplained">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/gotham-professor-pig-explained/|title=Gotham: Professor Pyg's Comic Origins And Differences Explained|website=Screen Rant|date=November 2017|access-date=February 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210022702/https://screenrant.com/gotham-professor-pig-explained/|archive-date=February 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="GothamIN">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/gotham-season-4-professor-pyg/|title=Gotham Season 4 Will Introduce Professor Pyg|website=Screen Rant|date=23 July 2017|access-date=February 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725063328/https://screenrant.com/gotham-season-4-professor-pyg/|archive-date=July 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The name Pyg is a shortening of ''Pygmalion'', [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play that was adapted into the musical ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' starring [[Rex Harrison]], which tells the story of a professor's attempt to convert a street urchin into an educated, high-society woman. According to Morrison, "Movie enthusiasts will know that Rex Harrison also played [[Doctor Doolittle]], who by strange coincidence was famed for teaching barnyard animals to speak proper, so our Professor Pyg mixes all these characteristics and influences together to create a monster who wants to make everything and everyone 'perfect,' as he sees it".<ref name="Pygmalion" /> On the [[DC Comics]] website, journalist Meg Downey notes parallels between Professor Pyg's view of his Dollotrons and the Greek mythological figure [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], who carved a statue of a woman out of ivory that was so realistic and beautiful he fell in love with his creation.<ref name="Partner">{{cite web|url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/10/04/doctors-demons-and-daddy-issues-the-strange-partnership-of-nightwing-and-robin|title=Doctors, Demons and Daddy Issues: The Strange Partnership of Nightwing and Robin|website=[[DC Comics]]|date=4 October 2017|access-date=February 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118012018/http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/10/04/doctors-demons-and-daddy-issues-the-strange-partnership-of-nightwing-and-robin|archive-date=January 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Morrison referred to the character's experiments to force biology to conform to his will as an "attempt to dominate and redefine the feminine principle", comparing it to the wire mother experiments performed by psychologist [[Harry Harlow]] on infant monkeys and to the [[proto-mother]] mythologies of [[Mesopotamia]] and ancient [[Babylon]]: "The shattered mind of Lazlo Valentin has mashed all of these connections into a frightening personal 'mythos', constructed to justify his deranged activities as Professor Pyg".<ref name="Reborn" /> Morrison also said Pyg's deranged rants in ''Batman and Robin Must Die'' allude to animal experimentation carried out in the US in the mid-twentieth century, including Harlow and [[John B. Calhoun]]'s Rockville barn rat population research, which collectively influenced the character's origin story.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=Grant |date=May 11, 2011 |title=[[Batman and Robin (comic book)#Collected editions|Batman & Robin: Batman & Robin must die!]]&ndash;"Death Wishes: Behind the Scenes" |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |page=160 |isbn=978-1-4012-3091-3 |author-link=Grant Morrison }}</ref> In the comics, Pyg has a makeshift mother constructed from boards and nails from which [[auditory hallucination]]s continuously compel him to improve his work.<ref name="Mommy" /> In ''Batman'' #62, Bruce Wayne compares Pyg's love for his work to his own fixation with vigilantism, having built up his ideals and philosophies since he witnessed his parents being murdered as a boy.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =[[Tom King (writer)|Tom King]] | penciller =Mitch Geralds | inker =Mitch Geralds | colorist =Mitch Geralds | letterer =Clayton Cowles | editor =Jamie S.

Pyg was adapted differently from the comics in the television series ''Beware the Batman''; developer [[Glen Murakami]] said, "it's not like we're trying to change it, but we only have 22 minutes to tell that story. The theme that we went in with Pyg and Toad was kind of ''Wind in the Willows'', but they also became like a twisted [Sherlock] Holmes and Watson. It felt like it flowed, it felt like it had a theme. That seemed more important for that to track rather than all the backstory."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/18514-beware-the-batman-producers-seek-to-make-batman-feel-new-again.html|title=Beware the Batman Producers Seek to Make Batman Feel New Again|website=Newsarama|access-date=February 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206224533/http://www.newsarama.com/18514-beware-the-batman-producers-seek-to-make-batman-feel-new-again.html|archive-date=December 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Chris Sims of the journalism website ''[[ComicsAlliance]]'' said the changes are "about as far from melting people's faces, stripping in front of a wire mother and dosing Gotham City with a psychotropic drug as you're likely to get".<ref name="BewareAlliance" /> According to ''Comic Book Resources'' writer Kieran Shiach, the ''Arkham Knight'' iteration is a very accurate facsimile of the original comic book portrayal, the major difference being the character's new enthusiasm for opera music.<ref name="CBRPyg" /> Pyg's in-game attributes label him a [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] and an amateur opera vocalist. Before his confrontation with Batman, during which Pyg describes his surgical operations as "fixing" his victims who are unique and broken, Batman is warned by [[Alfred Pennyworth]] that Pyg is "unhinged, even by Gotham's standards". After Pyg's capture, he claims his mutilated victims are works of art, and while in a police lockup, he expresses concern for how they are being treated.<ref name="Arkham" />

In the television series ''Gotham'', Lazlo Valentin is portrayed as a contract killer who impersonates other serial killers. He creates an elaborate persona of a murderer under the Professor Pyg alias to aid Sofia Falcone's rise to power in Gotham City's criminal underworld.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/gothams-fall-finale-underscores-the-seasons-more-focuse-1821107169|title=Gotham's fall finale underscores the season's more focused storytelling|website=AV Club|access-date=February 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208135538/https://www.avclub.com/gothams-fall-finale-underscores-the-seasons-more-focuse-1821107169|archive-date=December 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Actor Michael Cerveris said of the faux persona, "Professor Pyg is a brilliant and chameleon-like person who has a highly developed sense of what's right and wrong—it just might not be a sense of right and wrong that corresponds with everybody else's". Executive producer [[John Stephens (TV producer)|John Stephens]] said the character was chosen for the show because "He hits that sweet spot of being grotesque and terrifying, but also a little bit in that fairy-tale-esque world". Cerveris said Pyg takes delight in his actions and sees himself as a mirror image to James Gordon, who also wants to end corruption in the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. Pyg spells his name with a "y" as an homage to Pygmalion and because he wants to remake Gotham City in his own image. He also wants to make Gordon into a better version of himself; according to Cerveris, "He is almost looking at Gordon as an ally, like 'I'm on your side, Jim'. And Jim is saying, 'No, you're actually a sociopath'. So it works in many ways as a seduction on Pyg's part as he tries to pull (Jim) in."<ref name="USAToday">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/10/19/gotham-first-look-michael-cerveris-hog-heaven-batman-villain-professor-pyg/780345001/|title='Gotham' first look: Michael Cerveris is in hog heaven as Batman villain Professor Pyg|website=USAToday|access-date=November 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025015541/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/10/19/gotham-first-look-michael-cerveris-hog-heaven-batman-villain-professor-pyg/780345001/|archive-date=October 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=A Dark Knight: A Day in the Narrows  |series=[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]] |network=Fox |date=November 2, 2017 |season=Four}}</ref>

In early episodes of ''Gotham'', Pyg claims to have suffered at the hands of Gotham City's elite, implying a troubled past for the Pyg persona and a vengeful motive. Cerveris stated Pyg is aware of his actions but may not be comfortable with himself, which may be partly because he is covering his true identity. Layers of his disguise are continuously stripped down and reapplied.<ref name="Mosaic">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/gotham-season-4-interview-michael-cerveris/#professor-pyg|title=Michael Cerveris on Playing Professor Pyg on 'Gotham', Being Part of 'Mosaic', and More|website=Collider|date=15 November 2017|access-date=November 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118010417/http://collider.com/gotham-season-4-interview-michael-cerveris#professor-pyg|archive-date=November 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Hailing from the southern United States, Valentin uses implanted, shifting metal plates and facial reconstruction to help him hide his true identity.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=A Dark Knight: Things That Go Boom  |series=[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]] |network=Fox |date=November 30, 2017 |season=Four}}</ref> Before the Pyg persona is revealed to be fake, Cerveris said he lacks his alter ego's  trademark surgical prowess because it was intended to focus more on his relationship with the city and James Gordon, and that the Dollotrons are not the sole purpose of his existence.

[[File:Gotham Professor Pyg.jpg|thumb|right|Professor Pyg's traditional pig mask was adapted into one more resembling the flesh of a pig that, according to Michael Cerveris, gave it a more disturbing and comedic quality.]]

Much of his original wardrobe in the comic books was designed by Frank Quitely and is a homage to the [[Edwardian era#Fashion|Edwardian]] suits worn by Rex Harrison in ''My Fair Lady''.<ref name="Reborn" />

The television series ''Gotham'' was planned to feature a pig mask that more closely resembled the comic book version but it was deemed "a little too cheery and pink". Executive producer [[Danny Cannon]] decided the mask should look like decapitated pig flesh. Cerveris found the change to be simultaneously comical and disturbing; he had some difficulty acting in the mask due to its weight and the heat underneath, and because it blocked his peripheral vision. According to Cerveris, "the mask is a really freeing aspect, and I felt naked when I didn't have the mask on, and couldn't really be Professor Pyg".

According to Fugere, Pyg is "basically Hannibal Lecter on steroids and is a reminder that not all superhero comics are for kids".
