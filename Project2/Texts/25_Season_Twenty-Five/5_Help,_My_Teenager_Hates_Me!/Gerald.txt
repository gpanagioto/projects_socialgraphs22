 Wha– Wha– What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Okay, okay, Kyle, breathe. "Airsoft Armory"? My God! Is this stuff real?! I-I really don't think your mom would approve, Kyle… This stuff is expensive! Is this really how you want to spend your allowance? These are all, like, legal, right? So it's all totally safe? What people mostly play Airsoft? Hey, Kyle… Uh, how did the Airsoft go? Are you sure this isn't all a little too much for you, son? I love you too, Kyle. He's just… experimenting.  Hey, buddy, what's up? I thought you were gonna go out and play Airsoft today? Oh.  D-Did something happen? Oh. Well, you know, they say that the… brain chemistry of a teenager is the same as that of a psychopath. The hormones and all that—it's been proven they're literally criminally insane.  Oh, buddy. Well, maybe you could ask the Airsoft field to let you play without the teenagers. Well… did you guys ever consider your dads? Come on in, boys.  What do you think? This one can shoot a thousand BBs in like five seconds. No, it's safe. See? As long as your gun has a red tip and you're white, police won't shoot you. We need some equipment. We're gonna try and take out some teenagers. Yeah, well, I've got something bigger.  American Express Platinum. Give me one of everything you have. This army! Did you see how those teenagers ran? Hey, that's what we're here for, right? We're just glad you wanted to spend some time with us.  Not yet… we still have a few good years before they turn into monsters.
