 Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about. Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading.  This could be the final stand-off. Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended.  The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
