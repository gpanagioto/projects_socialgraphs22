'''Voyager''' ('''Va Nee Gast''', initially known by the alias '''Valerie Vector''') is a [[fictional superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #675 as part of the ''[[Avengers: No Surrender]]'' storyline. Voyager was initially presented as a "lost" founding member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but was subsequently revealed to be the daughter and ally of the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], one of the [[Elders of the Universe]], before truly defecting to the Avengers' side.

==Concept and creation==
The concept of a "lost founder" of the Avengers was initially suggested during the planning of ''[[Marvel Legacy]]'', with writers tentatively attributing the idea to [[Tom Brevoort]]. The concept is similar to that of [[Triumph (comics)|Triumph]], a retroactively established founding member of the [[Justice League of America]] co-created by [[Mark Waid]], one of the creators of Voyager; as a result, Waid was insistent that Voyager not be a "real" founder", not wanting to repeat his work on Triumph.<ref name=cbrinterview>[https://www.cbr.com/avengers-no-surrender-waid-ewing-zub-hulk-return-voyager-identity/ Avengers: No Surrender Writers Talk Hulk's Return & Voyager's True Identity]</ref> The similarity between the two was alluded to in Voyager's fictional backstory, in which she claims to have been erased from history while fighting "Victory, the Electromagnetic Man", a [[pastiche]] of Triumph and member of the [[Squadron Sinister]].<ref name="avengers676">''Avengers'' #676. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Voyager's powers of teleportation were suggested by [[Jim Zub]] as abilities that were not widely represented among the Avengers, as well as being useful as a [[plot device]] for the story of ''No Surrender''.<ref name=cbrinterview /> Her name was suggested both to relate to her powers and allude to the naming conventions of the [[Elders of the Universe]]; other names considered included "Legacy", "Vector", "Apex", "Transit" and "Portal Princess".<ref>''Avengers'' #687. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her design was created by [[Mike Allred]] and [[Laura Allred]], and was specifically intended to fit alongside the designs of Marvel characters from the 1960s, the era which Voyager supposedly hailed from.<ref>''Avengers'' #685.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Avengers 684 Voyager and Grandmaster.jpg|left|thumb|A young Voyager and her father [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].]]
Va Nee Gast was the daughter of the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], travelling the galaxy with him and gambling for the fates of planets. However, she came to resent her father for treating her as a playing piece in his games.<ref name=avengers684>''Avengers'' #684. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Earth was chosen as the battleground for a contest between the Grandmaster and his brother, the [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]], Voyager was secretly planted on the planet as the Grandmaster's "secret weapon",<ref name=avengers684 /> using her newly-granted powers to implant false memories in order to adopt the guise of "Valerie Vector", a founding member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] who was lost fighting [[Squadron Sinister]] member Victory the Electronic Man.<ref name=avengers676 /> When the truth of her identity was revealed by the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Edwin Jarvis]], Voyager turned on her allies and claimed the fifth "pyramoid" target of the contest for herself;<ref name=avengers683>''Avengers'' #683. Marvel Comics.</ref> however, during the Avengers' defense of their headquarters against the [[Hulk]], Voyager found herself moved by their bravery and heroism, leading her to aid them in restoring Earth to its proper place and in defeating the Challenger, whose anger had been provoked by the Grandmaster's duplicity.<ref name=avengers689>''Avengers'' #689. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the aftermath, the Avengers offered her membership, but she declined, feeling she had not truly earned it yet and vowed to return if the Grandmaster ever threatened Earth again. Wishing to make amends for her actions, Voyager took it upon herself to watch over the newly-imprisoned Challenger on the Far Shore of life and death, showing him the adventures of the Avengers in the hope that he would find the same inspiration in them that she did.<ref name=avengers690>''Avengers'' #690. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Voyager returns in ''[[Avengers: No Road Home]]'' after the goddess [[Nyx (Marvel Comics)|Nyx]] is released from her imprisonment by the contest between the Grandmaster and Challenger, causing global night to fall across the universe.<ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Feeling responsible for Nyx's release, Voyager assembles a team of Avengers consisting of [[Monica Rambeau|Spectrum]], the Vision, [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], Hulk, [[Rocket Raccoon]], and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], but they are too late to stop Nyx from slaughtering the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian Gods]].<ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Voyager sends the Avengers across dimensions to stop Nyx's children from reclaiming the three shards of her power, but is captured by Nyx in the process and enslaved by the powers of [[Oizys]], goddess of misery.<ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though Voyager is able to temporarily keep the shard kept in Omnipotence City away from Nyx by teleporting it, and the Scarlet Witch, through time to the [[Hyborian Age]], Nyx follows them to the past and reclaims the shard.<ref name=noroadhome5>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #5</ref><ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Voyager is freed from Oizys' control when Hercules overcomes his despair and offers her his aid, crushing Oizys to death in the process and allowing the Avengers and [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan the Cimmerian]] to follow Nyx to the final shard, on the planet Euphoria.<ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though Voyager is brought to the point of collapse by overuse of her powers, she manages to transport the Avengers one final time, following the fully powered Nyx to the House of Ideas, the dwelling place of the [[One-Above-All]], and allowing the Vision to enter the House and stop Nyx from rewriting creation in her image.<ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> With Nyx defeated, Voyager returned to the Far Shore, only to discover that the Challenger had escaped his imprisonment and disappeared.<ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Voyager has the ability to create portals that teleport herself and others through time and space with no apparent limitations on distance; she was able to take the Challenger to the Far Shore, the "furthest point of life and death",<ref name=avengers690 /> and transport the Avengers through time to the [[Hyborian Age]].<ref name=noroadhome5 /> However, use of these powers repeatedly or on large numbers of people is draining on Voyager, requiring her to rest before using them again.<ref name=avengers677>''Avengers'' #677. Marvel Comics.</ref> Voyager is also able to fly through her quantum powers.<ref name="avengers676"/>

Her powers also extend to the ability to "travel through memories", implanting new memories of herself and altering existing ones to include her.<ref name=avengers684 /> This ability was unable to affect the synthetic [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], and when the truth was revealed to the other Avengers, they quickly realised that their memories were fake.<ref name=avengers683>''Avengers'' #683. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
As established by the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe, the fictional backstory that Voyager gave to the Avengers is true in the alternate reality of Earth-17122. On this Earth, Valerie Vector was the daughter of scientist Arthur Vector, who gained her quantum powers when she ran into the path of one of her father's experiments after hearing that her mother wanted a divorce. Voyager served as a superhero and Avenger for years until she was seemingly killed during a fight with the Squadron Sinister.<ref name="avengers676"/><ref>[https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/avengers-no-road-home-who-is-voyager 'Avengers: No Road Home': Who is Voyager?]</ref>
