 What are you doing, Cartman? What's it? That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this? Mr. Hankey!  Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq. But how are we gonna get to the North Pole? Yeah.  Me neither. Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman?? Finally! Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes? Wow, cool! Is that what this is all about?!  Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing? What are you doing? Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down! All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that! We don't know. They lost all contact with him. Jesus, behind you!  You bastards.  On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel.  Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!  Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh! Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll! Dude, where have you been? Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with.
