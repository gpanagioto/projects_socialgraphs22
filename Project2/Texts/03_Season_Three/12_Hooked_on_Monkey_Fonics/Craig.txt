Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball. Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out! Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!  Enjoying your lunch, nerdo? Get him!  Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole. That's the point, buttpipe.  Oh my God!  No! He's my friend!
