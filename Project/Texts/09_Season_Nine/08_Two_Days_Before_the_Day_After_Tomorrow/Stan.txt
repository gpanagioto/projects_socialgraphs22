Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat. Man, I wish I could really drive this thing. Sure I do! Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.  Okay, turn on the ignition, Okay...   Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button!   Jesus Christ!!! Oh dude! Oh Jesus! You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy! What? Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers. Huh oh.  Mom, Dad?  The, they're gonna go help those people, right? Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right? Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night? You saw all those people trapped on their roofs? Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault! But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them! Maybe they couldn't get out! Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.  Nothing. Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all. Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood. Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.  Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood. Because, I know what did cause the flood. No. No. No. No. ...sort of.  Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam. Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves. We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it. Uh, hey Dad. Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone! No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something. Nothing. Can you just come get us, please? We have to find a way out!  Come on! We've gotta get to the roof!     No. I broke the dam. No. I broke the dam.  I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it. No! I broke the fucking dam! I literally broke the dam! On a boat! That wasn't mine! I kept it secret, for two days! The boat caught on fire, and it exploded! Ohhh, fuck it!
