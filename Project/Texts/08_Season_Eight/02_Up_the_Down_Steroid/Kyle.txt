They're Olympic games for handicapped people. Yeah, that'd be cool. Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys. ...You're an asshole, Cartman. What? Oh no. Cartman, no!  Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics! Because!   God damn you! No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a ''parent'' with you to sign up for the Special Olympics. It says ''right there'' "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha!  Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive.  I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it! I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!  I came here to talk about you!
