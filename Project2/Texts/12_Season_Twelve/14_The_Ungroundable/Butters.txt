 Stan! Stan, we have a big problem. There's vampires in the school! Vampires. I've seen 'em. Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. Then Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!  But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything. Really? Do you think that's best? All right!   12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.  Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire. That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too. Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're-   Hwaaaahh! Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it! Oh no, what'd I do this time?  Oh jeez... I have no idea, sir. Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-It's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were- A well-organized pantry. Well, okay, but, Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-   I- I'm Butters. O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding! Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire. Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity. Yes! Yes, anything else? Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back. I have done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food. Yeah, I guess. Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school. Whoa. Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh.  I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father! You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable.  I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se.  Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it! I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna...   Ow. What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry. Hey Dad.  I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak. Dahhh.  Myah! Maybe not.  I want to help you. Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again. I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires.  Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic. They're putting an end to it!   I changed back! Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again! What's that, Dad? Uh oh. ''Aw, dang it![walks up the stairs to his room.]''
