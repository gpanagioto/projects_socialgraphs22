'''Captain America''' is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; superheroes (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[cartoonist]]s [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941) from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic [[supersoldier]] who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the ''Captain America'' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.

The character wears a costume bearing an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], and he utilizes a [[Captain America's shield|nearly-indestructible shield]] that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a frail young artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental "[[Captain America#Super Soldier Serum|super-soldier serum]]" after joining the military to aid the [[United States]] government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in [[Cryopreservation|suspended animation]] until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure both with the American public and in the superhero community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 [[Serial (film)|movie serial]], ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]''. Since then, the character has been featured in [[Captain America in other media|other films and television series]]. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] was portrayed by [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]. Captain America was ranked sixth on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time" in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|date= 2011|website=IGN|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173526/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|archive-date= June 30, 2015|url-status=live|access-date= July 9, 2015}}</ref> second in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|date= April 30, 2012 |title= The Top 50 Avengers|website=IGN|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151129171205/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|archive-date= November 29, 2015|url-status=live|access-date=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and second in their "Top 25 best Marvel superheroes" list in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|title=Top 25 Best Marvel Superheroes|first1= Joshua|last1= Yehl|first2= Jeff|last2= Lake|date= September 10, 2014|website= IGN|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031191046/http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|archive-date= October 31, 2014|url-status=live|access-date= October 19, 2015}}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{further|List of Captain America titles}}

===Creation===
In 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume.<ref>1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program, cover</ref> "I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page," Simon said in his autobiography, and then decided:

{{blockquote|No, it didn't work. There were too many "Supers" around. "Captain America" had a good sound to it. There weren't a lot of captains in comics. It was as easy as that. The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team.<ref name=joesimonp50>{{Cite book |last= Simon|first= Joe|author2=Simon, Jim|title= The Comic Book Makers|publisher= Crestwood/II|year= 1990|page= 50|isbn= 978-1-887591-35-5}} Reissued by Vanguard Productions in 2003.</ref>}}

Simon recalled in his autobiography that [[Timely Comics]] publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] gave him the go-ahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible. Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:

{{blockquote|I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue&nbsp;... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. "You're still number one, Jack," I assured him. "It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue."

"I'll make the deadline," Jack promised. "I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline." I hadn't expected this kind of reaction&nbsp;... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby&nbsp;... I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures."<ref name=joesimonp50 />}}

Al Lieberman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.<ref>Simon, p. 51.</ref>

Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in [[World War II]] and felt war was inevitable: "The opponents to the war were all quite well organized. We wanted to have our say too."<ref name="Wright 36">{{Cite book |last= Wright| first= Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year= 2001|location= Baltimore, Maryland|isbn= 978-0-8018-7450-5|page= 36}}</ref> It has been observed that the Captain America character has numerous elements of Jewish iconography as a variant of the idea of the [[Golem]], an automaton who protects the Jewish community who was created by an elder of that community, Dr. Irkstine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Isaak |first1=Joshua |title=Captain America Is A Jewish Golem - Theory Explained |url=https://screenrant.com/captain-america-jewish-golem-jack-kirby-joe-simon/ |website=Screenrant |date=December 3, 2021 |access-date=17 September 2022}}</ref>

Simon noted, "When the first issue came out we got a lot of&nbsp; ... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for."<ref name="Wright 36"/> The threats, which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices, proved so serious that police protection was posted with [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Fiorello La Guardia]] personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support.<ref>{{cite book|last = Cronin|first = Brian|title = Was Superman a Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|publisher = [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]]|year = 2009|location= New York, New York|pages = 135–136|isbn = 978-0-452-29532-2}}</ref>

Though preceded as a "patriotically themed superhero" by [[Archie Comics|MLJ]]'s [[The Shield (Archie)|The Shield]], Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II,<ref name="Sanderson18">{{cite book|last1 = Sanderson|first1 = Peter|author-link = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura|chapter= 1940s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 18|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Cap was not the first patriotically themed super hero, but he would become the most enduring. He was Timely's most popular hero with nearly a million copies of his comic sold per month.}}</ref> as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first. This popularity drew the attention and a complaint from MLJ that the character's triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their Shield character. In response, Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue 2, which went on to become an iconic element of the character.<ref>Cronin, p. 134</ref> With his sidekick [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]], Captain America faced villains from [[Nazi Germany]], [[Empire of Japan]], and other threats to wartime America and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Stanley Lieber, now better known as [[Stan Lee]], in his first professional fiction writing task, contributed to the character in issue #3 in the filler text story "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge", which introduced the character's use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon.<ref name="AmazingMarvelUniverse">{{Cite book |last= Thomas|first= Roy|author-link = Roy Thomas|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe| publisher= [[Sterling Publishing]]|location= New York, New York|year= 2006|page= 11|isbn= 978-1-4027-4225-5|quote= The line reads: "With the speed of thought, he sent his shield spinning through the air to the other end of the tent, where it smacked the knife out of Haines' hand!" It became a convention starting the following issue, in which the art in a Simon and Kirby comics story illustrates the following caption: "Captain America's speed of thought and action save Bucky's life – as he hurls his shield across the room.}}</ref> Captain America soon became Timely's most popular character and even had a fan-club called the "Sentinels of Liberty".<ref name="Wright 36"/>

Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue, which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' during the period.<ref name="Sanderson18" /><ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|author-link = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

The character was featured in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #1–19 (Summer 1941 – Fall 1946), ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #80–84 and #86–92, ''[[USA Comics]]'' #6–17 (Dec. 1942 – Fall 1945), and ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #1–10 (Fall 1943 – Summer 1946).

In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Captain America led Timely's first superhero team, the [[All-Winners Squad]], in its two published adventures, in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #19 and #21 (Fall–Winter 1946; there was no issue #20). After Bucky was shot and wounded in a 1948 ''Captain America'' story, he was succeeded by Captain America's girlfriend, Betsy Ross, who became the superheroine [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]]. ''Captain America Comics'' ran until issue #73 (July 1949),<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 237|title= Captain America Comics}}</ref> at which time the series was retitled '''''Captain America's Weird Tales'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> for two issues,<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 238|title= Captain America's Weird Tales}}</ref> with the finale being a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes.

[[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America, along with the original Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner, in ''Young Men'' #24 (Dec. 1953). Billed as "Captain America, Commie Smasher!"<!--note: This is a cover nickname on all his 1950s comics, and presented in all caps like "Daredevil, The Man Without Fear". And in any case, "Commie," short for "Communist," a proper noun, is always capped--> Captain America appeared during the next year in ''Young Men'' #24–28 and ''Men's Adventures'' #27–28, as well as in issues #76–78 of an eponymous title. Atlas' attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure,<ref>Wright, p. 123.</ref> and the character's title was canceled with ''Captain America'' #78 (Sept. 1954).

In the [[Human Torch]] story titled "Captain America" in Marvel Comics' ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #114 (Nov. 1963),<ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 95: "As the Human Torch had been instrumental in bringing back the Sub-Mariner in ''The Fantastic Four'' #4 (May 1962), it seemed only natural that he would help usher in Captain America."</ref> writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]] depicted the brash young [[Fantastic Four]] member Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in an exhibition performance with Captain America, described as a legendary World War II and 1950s superhero who has returned after many years of apparent retirement. The 18-page story ends with this Captain America revealed as an impostor: it was actually the villain the Acrobat, a former circus performer the Torch had defeated in ''Strange Tales'' #106, who broke two thieves out of jail, hoping to draw the police away while trying to rob the local bank. Afterward, Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers. A caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return. According to Lee, fan response to the tryout was very enthusiastic.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 9|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

[[File:CaptainAmerica109.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Captain America'' #109 (January 1969).<br />Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Syd Shores]].]]
Captain America was then formally reintroduced in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #4 (March 1964),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 99: "'Captain America lives again!' announced the cover of ''The Avengers'' #4. A mere [four] months after his imposter had appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #114, the real Cap was back."</ref> which explained that in the final days of World War II, he had fallen from an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] and spent decades frozen in a block of ice in a state of [[suspended animation]]. The hero found a new generation of readers as leader of that superhero team. Following the success of other Marvel characters introduced during the 1960s, Captain America was recast as a hero "haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society".<ref>Wright, p. 215.</ref>

After then guest-starring in the feature "[[Iron Man]]" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #58 (Oct. 1964), Captain America gained his own solo feature in that "split book", beginning the following issue.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 103</ref> Issue #63 (March 1965), which retold Captain America's origin, through issue #71 (Nov. 1965) was a period feature set during World War II and co-starred Captain America's Golden Age sidekick, Bucky. Kirby drew all but two of the stories in ''Tales of Suspense,'' which became ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' with #100 (April 1968);<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 128: "Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles: ''Tales of Suspense'' #99 was followed by ''Captain America'' #100."</ref> [[Gil Kane]] and [[John Romita Sr.]], each filled in once. Several stories were finished by penciller-inker [[George Tuska]] over Kirby layouts, with one finished by Romita Sr. and another by penciller [[Dick Ayers]] and inker [[John Tartaglione]]. Kirby's regular inkers on the series were [[Frank Giacoia]] (as "Frank Ray") and [[Joe Sinnott]], though [[Don Heck]] and Golden Age Captain America artist [[Syd Shores]] inked one story each.  A story in issue #155-157 revealed the 1950s "Commie Smasher" Captain America and Bucky to be imposters.

This series – considered ''Captain America'' volume one by comics researchers and historians,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer2.htm#S35 | title=''Captain America'' (1968–1996) | publisher=The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators | access-date=2010-11-11 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224173534/http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer2.htm#S35 | archive-date=2011-02-24 | url-status=live }} and {{gcdb series|id= 1860|title= Captain America}}</ref> following the 1940s ''Captain America Comics'' and its 1950s numbering continuation of ''Tales of Suspense'' – ended with #454 (Aug. 1996).

After Rogers' return, Barnes, at Rogers' insistence, continued as Captain America, beginning in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic ''Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield?'' (Feb. 2010).

==Legal status==
In 1966, Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics, asserting that he—not Marvel—was legally entitled to renew the [[copyright]] upon the expiration of the original 28-year term. The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and therefore it was [[work for hire]] owned by them.<ref name=philly>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLSummer03CaptainAmerica|work=The Philadelphia Lawyer| publisher= Philadelphia Bar Association |access-date= August 6, 2013|title=The Struggle for Captain America|last=Lovitz|first=Michael | archive-date= December 2, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222355/http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLSummer03CaptainAmerica | url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1999, Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term (but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation) had expired. Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim, arguing that the settlement of Simon's 1966 suit made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer. Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003, in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character.<ref name=philly/><ref>{{cite news|title= Joe Simon, a Creator of Captain America, Fighting On|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/books/16gust.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|work= [[The New York Times]]|first= George Gene|last= Gustines|date= April 16, 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181102081658/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/books/16gust.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|archive-date= November 2, 2018|url-status=dead|access-date= August 6, 2013}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===20th century===
====1940s====
[[File:Captain America Comics 1 (March 1941) page 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Captain America and Bucky's debuts, in ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941 Timely Comics). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Steven Rogers was born in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], in 1920 to poor [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, Sarah and Joseph Rogers.<ref name="sentinel">{{cite comic| writer= [[Fabian Nicieza|Nicieza, Fabian]]|penciller= [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Maguire, Kevin]]|inker= [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Joe]]|story= First Flight of the Eagle|title= The Adventures of Captain America|issue= 1|date= September 1991}}</ref> Joseph died when Steve was a child, and Sarah died of pneumonia while Steve was a teen. By early 1940, before America's entry into [[World War II]], Rogers is a tall, scrawny [[fine art]]s student specializing in illustration and a comic book writer and artist.

Disturbed by the devastation of Europe by the Nazis, Rogers attempts to enlist but is rejected due to his frail body. His resolution attracts the notice of U.S. Army General [[Chester Phillips]] and "Project: Rebirth". Rogers is used as a test subject for the [[Supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] project, receiving a special serum made by "Dr. Josef Reinstein",<ref name="captainamericacomics1">{{cite comic| writer= [[Joe Simon|Simon, Joe]]; [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Liederman, Al|story= Case No. 1.

The serum is a success and transforms Steve Rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength, agility, stamina, and intelligence. The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings.<ref name="modernorigin"/> The process itself has been inconsistently detailed: While in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super-Serum, when the origin was retold in the 1960s, the [[Comic Code Authority]] had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse, and thus the Super-Serum was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] into an oral formula.<ref name="tos origin">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= The Origin of Captain America!|title= [[Tales of Suspense]]|issue= 63|date= March 1965}}</ref>

Erskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment, leaving behind a flawed, imperfect knowledge of the steps. Thus, when the Nazi [[secret agent|spy]] [[Heinz Kruger]] killed him, Erskine's method of creating new Super-Soldiers died. Captain America, in his first act after his transformation, avenges Erskine. In the 1941 origin story and in ''Tales of Suspense'' #63, Kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by Rogers; in the ''Captain America'' #109 and #255 revisions, Rogers causes the spy's death by punching him into machinery.<ref name="modernorigin"/>

Unable to create new Super-Soldiers and willing to hide the Project Rebirth fiasco, the American government casts Rogers as a patriotic superhero, able to counter the menace of the [[Red Skull]] as a [[counter-intelligence]] agent. He is supplied with a patriotic uniform of his own design,<ref name="sentinel"/> a bulletproof shield, a personal [[Sidearm (weapon)|side arm]], and the codename Captain America, while posing as a clumsy [[infantry]] private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia. He forms a friendship with the camp's teenage [[mascot]], James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes.<ref name="captainamericacomics1"/>

Barnes learns of Rogers' [[secret identity|dual identity]] and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain America's [[sidekick]]. During their adventures, [[Franklin D.

In addition to Bucky, Captain America was occasionally assisted by the [[Sentinels of Liberty]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dittmer|first=Jason|title= 'America is safe while its boys and girls believe in its creeds!': Captain America and American identity prior to World War 2|journal= [[Environment and Planning|Environment and Planning D: Society and Space]]|date=March 23, 2007|volume=25|issue=3|pages=401–423|doi=10.1068/d1905|s2cid=143346525}}</ref> Sentinels of Liberty was the title given to members of the ''Captain America Comics'' fan club who Captain America sometimes addressed as an aside, or as characters in the ''Captain America Comics'' stories.

In late April 1945, during the closing days of World War II, Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous [[Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental drone plane. Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. The pair reaches the plane just before takeoff. When Bucky tries to defuse the bomb, it explodes in mid-air. Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic. Both are presumed dead, though it is later revealed that neither had died.<ref name="theavengers4"/>

====Late 1940s to 1950s====
Captain America appeared in comics for the next few years, changing from World War II-era hero fighting the Nazis to confronting the United States' newest enemy, [[Communism]]. The revival of the character in the mid-1950s was short-lived, and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people operated using the code name to explain the changes in the character. These post World War II successors are listed as [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|William Naslund]] and [[Jeffrey Mace]]. They are assisted by [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)#Fred Davis|Fred Davis]] continuing the role of Bucky.

The last of these other official Captains, [[Captain America (William Burnside)|William Burnside]],<ref name="cap602">{{cite comic| writer= [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]]|penciller= [[Luke Ross|Ross, Luke]]|inker= [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Butch]]; Ross, Luke|story= Two Americas Part 1|title= Captain America|issue= 602|date= March 2010}}</ref> was a history graduate enamored with the Captain America mythos, having his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers and legally changing his name to "Steve Rogers", becoming the new "1950s Captain America".<ref name="CA153">{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]]|penciller= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|inker= [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]|story= Captain America—Hero Or Hoax?|title= Captain America|issue= 153|date= September 1972}}</ref> He administered to himself and his pupil [[Jack Monroe (comics)|James "Jack" Monroe]] a flawed, incomplete copy of the Super-Serum, which made no mention about the necessary Vita-Ray portion of the treatment. As a result, while Burnside and Monroe became the new Captain America and Bucky, they became violently paranoid, often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the [[Red Scare]] of the 1950s. Their insanity forced the U.S. government to place them in indefinite cryogenic storage until they could be cured of their mental illness.<ref name="CA156">{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Frank McLaughlin (artist)|McLaughlin, Frank]]|story= One Into Two Won't Go!|title= Captain America|issue= 156|date= December 1972}}</ref> Monroe would later be cured and assume the Nomad identity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[J.

====1960s to 1970s====
Years later, the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] discovers Steve Rogers' body in the North Atlantic. After he revives, they piece together that Rogers has been preserved in a block of ice since 1945, surviving because of his enhancements from Project: Rebirth. The block began to melt after the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], enraged that an [[Inuit]] tribe is worshipping the frozen figure, throws it into the ocean.<ref name="theavengers4">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= Captain America Joins&nbsp; ...

Captain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Bucky's death. Although he takes the young [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (who closely resembles Bucky) under his tutelage, he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity, not wishing to be responsible for another youth's death.

Following Gruenwald's departure from the series, Mark Waid took over and resurrected Sharon Carter as Cap's love interest.

Following Waid's run, Dan Jurgens took over and introduced new foe [[Protocide]], a failed recipient of the Super Soldier Serum prior to the experiment that successfully created Rogers. Some time after this, Rogers' original shield was retrieved, but subtle damage sustained during the battle with the Beyonder resulted in it being shattered and a 'vibranium cancer' being triggered that would destroy all vibranium in the world, with Rogers nearly being forced to destroy the shield before a confrontation with the villain [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] saw Klaw's attacks unwittingly repair the shield's fractured molecular bonds and negate cancer.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Waid, Mark|penciller= Kubert, Andy|inker= Delperdang, Jesse|story= Sacrifice Play|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 22|date= September 1999}}</ref>

In the 2006–2007 company-wide story arc "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", Rogers opposes the new mandatory [[2006 Superhuman Registration Act|federal registration of super-powered beings]], and leads the underground anti-registration movement.

''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' #1 (Aug. 2009) reveals that Rogers did not die, as the gun Sharon Carter had been hypnotized into firing at Rogers caused his consciousness to phase in and out of space and time, appearing at various points in his lifetime. Although Rogers manages to relay a message to the future by giving a time-delayed command to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]], the Skull returns Rogers to the present, where he takes control of Rogers' mind and body.

After Cyclops was incarcerated, and Steve accepted the Avengers should have done more to help mutants, and allowed the world to hate them, he started planning a new sub-team of Avengers in the hopes of unifying mutant and humankind alike. He chose [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] to lead his team and become the new face to represent mutants as [[Professor X]] and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] once were.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Their first threat was the return of the [[Red Skull]]- more specifically, a clone of the Skull created in 1942 and kept in stasis in the event of the original's death- who usurped Professor X's body to provide himself with telepathic powers, which he would use to provoke citizens of New York into a mass assault against mutants, or anyone who could be one, and force the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] to allow themselves to be attacked. With the help of the [[S-Man]] Honest John, he managed to even manipulate [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}

The Red Skull's skills were still erratic, and could not completely control Captain America, an attack against him was enough of a distraction to lose control of Rogue and the Scarlet Witch. After being overpowered by the rest of the Uncanny Avengers, the Red Skull escapes, but promises to return. In the aftermath, both Rogue and the Scarlet Witch joined the team.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

During the "[[Time Runs Out]]" storyline, Steve Rogers wears armor when he confronts Iron Man. The ensuing fight between the two old friends led Steve Rogers to force Iron Man to admit that he had lied to him and all of their allies, when he had known about the incursions between alternate Earths all along, but Iron Man also confessed that he would not change a thing. The final incursion started and Earth-1610 started approaching Earth-616 while Iron Man and Steve Rogers kept fighting. Earth-1610's S.H.I.E.L.D. launched a full invasion to destroy Earth-616, where Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were crushed by a Helicarrier.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Hickman, Jonathan|penciller= [[Stefano Caselli|Caselli, Stefano]]; [[Kev Walker|Walker, Kev]]|inker= Caselli, Stefano; Walker, Kev|story= One Was Life.

Steve Rogers later has an encounter with an alternate [[Old Man Logan|Logan from Earth-807128]]. After defeating Logan and bringing him to Alberta, Canada, Rogers tried to "reassure" Logan that this was not "his" past by showing him the adamantium-frozen body of Earth-616's Logan.

During the 2016 "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Steve Rogers learns from Rick Jones that S.H.I.E.L.D. has established Pleasant Hill, a gated community where they use Kobik to transform villains into ordinary citizens.

Rogers does this by "forcing" certain predictions on him, such as anonymously providing Bruce Banner with new gamma research to provoke a vision that would drive the Avengers to kill Banner, although this plan has apparently backfired with a recent vision showing the new [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] standing over the dead Steve Rogers.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Pina, Javier|inker= Pina, Javier|title= Captain America: Steve Rogers|issue= 5|date= November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Marquez, David|inker= Marquez, David|title= [[Civil War II]]|issue= 5|date= November 2016}}</ref> Despite this revelation, Rogers presents himself as the voice of reason by allowing Spider-Man to flee with Thor.

Later, Rogers goes to Sokovia and joins forces with Black Widow to liberate freedom fighters from a prison so they can reclaim their country.

In the 2017 "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Rogers, as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D, uses a subsequent alien invasion and a mass supervillain assault in order to seize control of the United States.

===Tactician and field commander===
Rogers' battle experience and military training make him an expert [[Military tactics|tactician]] and field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle. The Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and other heroes choose Rogers as their leader during the [[Secret Wars]]; Thor says that Rogers is one of the very few mortals he will take orders from, and follow "through the gates of Hades".<ref name=secretwars1>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]|penciller= Zeck, Mike|inker= Beatty, John|story= The War Begins|title= [[Secret Wars|Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars]]|issue= 1|date= May 1984}}</ref>

Years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy. His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a [[boomerang]]-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind. In canon, he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best [[hand-to-hand combat]]ants in the Marvel Universe, limited only by his human physique.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Carlin|Carlin, Mike]]|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= And Other Strangers|title= Captain America|issue= 302|date= February 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= The Devil You Know|title= Captain America|issue= 375|date= Late August 1990}}</ref> Although the Super Soldier Serum is an important part of his strength, Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents, even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre-Captain America physique.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= [[Dale Eaglesham|Eaglesham, Dale]]|inker= Eaglesham, Dale|story= For a lot of my childhood&nbsp; ... |title= Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier|issue= 3|date= November 2010}}</ref>

Stan Lee claimed that he'd "always been fascinated by the fact that, although Captain America has the least spectacular super-power of all, the mantle of leadership falls naturally upon him, as though he was born to command... Cap is one of the hardest hero characters to write, because the writer cannot use some exotic super-power to make his episodes seem colorful... All he has to serve him are his extraordinary combat skills, his shield, and his unquenchable love for freedom and justice."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Masterworks presents The Avengers, Volume 3|last=Lee, Stan, 1922-2018.|date=2011|publisher=Marvel Worldwide, Inc|others=Heck, Don.|isbn=9780785150565|location=New York|pages=6|oclc=666234797}}</ref>

Rogers has vast [[U.S. military]] knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing, classified Defense Department operations. He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, [[parkour]], military strategy, piloting, and demolitions. Despite his high profile as one of the world's most popular and recognizable superheroes, Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community, largely through his ongoing relationship with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]

===Super Soldier Serum===
Steve Rogers is often considered to be the pinnacle of human potential and constantly operates at peak (and often  beyond peak) physical performance due to his enhancement via the Super Soldier Serum. The Super Soldier Serum enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of [[lactic acid|fatigue poisons]] in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being. This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing {{convert|1100|lbs|kg}} as a warm-up,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark|penciller= [[Rik Levins|Levins, Rik]]|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= The Prowling|title= Captain America|issue=402|date= July 1992}}</ref> vision and reflexes fast enough to dodge bullets,<ref name="cav5no17">''Captain America'' Vol. 5 #17 (June 2006)</ref> and running a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in less than a minute (60&nbsp;mph/97&nbsp;km/h, easily exceeding the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= [[Javier Pulido|Pulido, Javier]]; [[Marcos Martín (cartoonist)|Martín, Marcos]]; [[Mike Perkins|Perkins, Mike]]|inker= Pulido, Javier; Martín, Marcos; Perkins, Mike|story= Secrets of Iron & Fire|title= Captain America 65th Anniversary Special|issue= 1|date= May 2006}}</ref> Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades.

===Weapons and equipment===
====Shield====
{{main|Captain America's shield}}[[File:Captain America's shield.svg|thumb|Captain America's shield]]
Captain America has used multiple shields throughout his history, the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from a unique combination of [[Vibranium]], Steel alloy, and an unknown third component that has never been duplicated called Proto-Adamantium.<ref name="CA303">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Carlin|Carlin, Mike]]|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Double Dare|title= Captain America|issue= 303|date= March 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Carlin, Mike|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Undercover of the Night|title= Captain America|issue= 304|date= April 1985}}</ref> The shield was cast by American metallurgist [[Dr. Myron MacLain]], who was contracted by the U.S. government, from orders of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II.<ref name="CA303" /> This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of [[adamantium]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Smith, Barry]]|inker= Shores, Syd|story= Betrayal|title= The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]|issue= 66|date= July 1969}}</ref>

Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon. The first instance of Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss occurs in [[Stan Lee]]'s first comics writing, the two-page text story "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge" in ''Captain America Comics'' #3 (May 1941).<ref name="AmazingMarvelUniverse" /> The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures; Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Nicieza, Fabian|penciller= Medina, Lan|inker= Tadeo, Ed|story= Living Legends|title= [[Cable & Deadpool]]|issue= 25|date= April 2006}}</ref>

When without his trademark shield, Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|penciller= [[Ron Garney|Garney, Ron]]|inker= [[Bob Wiacek|Wiacek, Bob]]|story= Museum Piece|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 3|date= March 1998}}</ref> or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Waid, Mark|penciller= [[Andy Kubert|Kubert, Andy]]|inker= Delperdang, Jesse|story= American Nightmare, Chapter One: The Bite of Madness!|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 9|date= September 1998}}</ref> Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Eaglesham, Dale|inker= Eaglesham, Dale|story= In 1940, the first Professor Erskine created what became&nbsp; ... |title= Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier|issue= 4|date= December 2010}}</ref> Much like his Vibranium shield, the energy shield can be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= McCann, Jim|penciller= Diaz, Paco; Dragotta, Nick|inker= Diaz, Paco; Dragotta, Nick|story= Off-Target!|title= Hawkeye: Blindspot|issue= 2|date= May 2011}}</ref>

====Uniform====
Captain America's uniform is made of a fire-retardant material, and he wears a lightweight, bulletproof [[duralumin]] [[Mail (armour)|scale armor]] beneath his uniform for added protection.<ref name="stern origin"/> Originally, Rogers' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.

====Motorcycle====
Captain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.

==Antagonists==

He is among the superheroes infected, along with his other fellow Avengers, by the zombified [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]]. Colonel America is responsible for infecting [[Spider-Man]] in ''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness'' by biting him on the shoulder. He is apparently killed by a zombie [[Red Skull]], who rips off his left arm and scoops his exposed brains out before he himself is decapitated by a zombified Spider-Man. Zombie Ant-Man then steps on the [[Red Skull]]. As his intellect was partly retained in the remaining portion of his brain, he was transplanted into [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s son T'Channa's dead body, and given a mechanical left arm. The transplant is successful, but the resulting brain damage turns Colonel America into a battle-crazed zombie leader, manageable but unable to focus on anything that is not related to war, confrontation, and battle. Colonel America (Steve Rogers/T'Channa) also has a role in ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'', where he was transported to Earth-Z.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' features a zombie version called "Captain Mexica", who comes from an alternate universe in which the [[Aztec]] Empire in [[Mexico]] never fell. He is killed after Machine Man cuts him in half.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===MC2===
In the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Captain America leads the original Avengers on a mission to an alternative reality, which claims the majority of the team. He stays behind to aid the rebels in that reality, thus adding to the list of the dead / [[missing in action]]. The next iteration of MC2 Avengers aids him in ''[[A-Next]]'' #10-11, at the end of which he gives [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]] the shield that had belonged to that universe's Captain America. Captain America and [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Thunderstrike]] return to their home universe to aid in the fight against [[Seth (comics)|Seth]]<ref>''[[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]'' #59. Marvel COmics.</ref>

In the 2005 limited series ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'', the MC2 Captain America is fatally injured leading a group of young heroes in battle against the Norse god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] uses his power to transform Captain America into a new star. In the sequel, ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'', [[Galactus]] states that this new star is the key to his escaping his world-devouring hunger{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

===Mutant X===
In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' universe, a mutant succeeds Rogers as Captain America, joining [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]'s team of superheroes, "The Six", in order to protect mutants from a deranged Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. He has powerful energy manipulating abilities which manifest when America is threatened. Using that power he manages to kill a platoon of Super Soldiers and the Avengers, which consist of Black Widow, Deathlok, Typhoid Mary, Hawkeye and Iron Giant Man ([[Iron Man (comics)|Tony Stark]]). He is defeated by Havok and is then drawn below the earth by [[The Beyonder]] who kills him after he finds out what he needs to know.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.===
Captain America is mentioned several times in ''Nextwave'', usually by [[Monica Rambeau]] (who constantly talks about her time as an Avenger). At one point, Monica theorizes that Captain America is secretly gay, as he was the only Avenger who never hit on her (Tabitha Smith agrees that it would be cool if that were true and that it would explain why "people always dress like him at gay pride marches"){{issue|date=February 2013}}

He appears in a flashback Monica has, when the Avengers are attacked by naked enemies. He tells her to "cover your eyes, go back to the mansion, and make my dinner".{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Old Man Logan===
In this [[Old Man Logan|potential future]], all the Marvel Universe superheroes were killed when the supervillains combined forces. The villains then conquer and divide up control of the United States.  Captain America is shown in a flashback as having been killed by the Red Skull in the ruins of the [[U.S. Capitol]]. The Red Skull subsequently takes Cap's costume and wears it as [[President of the United States|President of America]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #72 (June 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Peggy Carter===
{{main|Peggy Carter#Captain Carter}}

===Ruins===
[[Warren Ellis]]'s ''[[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]]'' limited series explored a version of the Marvel Universe where "everything went wrong". In this continuity, Captain America himself makes no physical appearance in the series aside from the cover for issue #1 and in a dream sequence in issue #2. He was a member of the Avengers, a revolutionary cell formed by Tony Stark bent on liberating California from the corrupt rule of President Charles Xavier, but along with many other members of the team, he is killed aboard the Avengers Quinjet. His shield is recovered by soldiers who celebrate the deaths of the Avengers. A part of the Captain's war history is touched upon by the now-psychotic Nick Fury, who was ordered to destroy the Quinjet by the President: "...I'll give you an anecdote. Back in the war, it was America introduced me to eating human meat."<ref>''Ruins'' #1-2 (August 1995 - September 1995)</ref>

===Spider-Gwen===
Captain America is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent on [[Spider-Gwen|Earth-65]], who apprehends [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] during her battle with the Lizard (this reality's Peter Parker). This Captain America is an African American woman named '''Samantha Wilson''' a genderbent version of [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson/Falcon]].<ref>''Radioactive Spider-Gwen'' #1</ref> During the 1940s, Samantha volunteered for Project: Rebirth after other test subjects were shot and killed or badly injured by Nazis. She became trapped in an alternate dimension after seemingly sacrificing herself to stop [[Arnim Zola]], but later managed to return home to find that 75 years had passed.<ref>''Radioactive Spider-Gwen'' #2</ref> Steve Rogers would go on to become a famous comic creator, who writes stories of Samantha's dimensional journeys that he saw in his dreams, which Sam confirmed as being accurate.<ref>''Spider-Gwen Annual'' #1</ref>

===Spider-Island===
In this retelling of ''Spider-Island'' as part of the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Captain America and the other heroes are mutated into monster spiders and he is still the Spider Queen's "Spider King" in the Battleworld domain of Spider-Island. However, Agent Venom gives Captain America the Godstone and turns him into a Man-Wolf (as an homage to the time when Captain America was a werewolf called Capwolf), releasing Steve from the Spider Queen's control. He uses his new form to fight for the resistance.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===Spider-Man: Life Story===
''Spider-Man: Life Story'' takes place in an alternate continuity where characters naturally age after Peter Parker debuts as Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Captain America is pressured by the public to join the efforts in Vietnam and decides to go to see the conflict for himself. A year later, American soldiers label Steve as a traitor when he decides to protect a Vietnamese village. Captain America also gets himself involved in the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]] in the 2000s. In the 2010s, it is unknown if he is dead or in hiding after Doctor Doom took over the planet.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #1-6 (March 2019)</ref>

===Truth: Red, White & Black===
{{Main|Truth: Red, White & Black}}
In the 2003 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Truth: Red, White & Black]]'', black soldiers act as test subjects for the WWII Super-Soldier program of 1942. Most of the subjects die, or become deformed with the exception of one, [[Isaiah Bradley]]. Isaiah substitutes for Captain America on an assignment, discovering Jewish concentration camp detainees subjected to experiments.<ref>''Truth: Red, White & Black'' #1-7 (January 2003 - July 2003)</ref>

In ''Captain America'' (vol. 4) #28 (August 2004), an [[Isaiah Bradley]] from an alternative Earth became Captain America and never married. Later, he is elected president and serves two terms. He travels back in time, accidentally crossing to [[Earth-616]], and brings the mainstream Captain America and Rebecca Quan forward into his own time to prevent his daughter, Rebecca "Becky" Barnes, from traveling to Earth-616.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
{{Main|Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)}}

In addition to the WWII era hero, a 1960s version of Captain America (a.k.a. "Captain America of the Vietnam War") exists as an [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe parallel to the [[Grand Director|William Burnside/Captain America of the 1950s]], who succeeded Rogers in the role after he is accidentally frozen. The 1960s Captain America is in fact Frank Simpson, better known in the Earth-616 Marvel Universe as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]]. As scientists were unable to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum, they used cybernetics and steroids to enhance Simpson, which eventually eroded his sanity.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Captain America'' (vol. 1) #1 (Mar 2011)</ref>

====Scott Summers====
In an [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Fantastic Four/Ultimate X-Men Annual #1|alternate future of the Ultimate Universe]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] assumes the mantle of Captain America after Steve Rogers dies and leads a small team of [[X-Men]] to fight for mutant justice.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four/Ultimate X-Men Annual'' #1</ref>

===Weapon X: Days of Future Now===
Steve Rogers is selected for the Weapon X program. He is given a procedure similar to Wolverine's that bonds vibranium to his skeleton. He is given the code name Vibram.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===What If?===
Alternative versions of Steve Rogers are seen within several issues of the ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' series.

* In "What If Captain America and Bucky Had Both Survived World War Two?", Steve is able to hold onto the drone plane and deactivate the bomb, allowing both men to survive. Baron Zemo is shot by the Red Skull for failing to kill Captain America and Bucky, but it is later revealed that the Skull shot him with a weapon which put him to sleep for 20 years. Bucky and Cap continue to fight in the 1950s and 1960s against Communists, though tragically Nick Fury is killed in the Korean War.  In the mid-1960s, Bucky goes his own way. Contacted by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the aged Steve is offered the job as the head of the newly created [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], but Steve declines and suggests Barnes instead.  S.H.I.E.L.D. and Barnes battle HYDRA, but fail to capture the Supreme Hydra. Joining Steve on one of his missions, the pair run into the Hulk and Rick Jones. Steve is knocked out, forcing Bucky to use Cap's shield and rescue Rick from the Hulk's rampage. Bucky decides to take on the role of Captain America, to which Steve agrees. Overhearing the conversation, Rick light-heartedly blackmails the two for the chance to be the new Bucky. Steve becomes the new leader of S.H.I.E.L.D..  Tracking the final group of HYDRA to an uncharted island, Steve and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter team up with the new Cap and Bucky. The group infiltrate the island's volcano, which turns out to be fake and created as a hideaway for HYDRA forces.  The four are captured, and the Supreme Hydra is revealed to be Baron Zemo, who has not aged for 20 years due to the Red Skull's weapon. Believing that Captain America is still Rogers, he prepares to kill Bucky, but Steve escapes his cuffs and frees the others. A fierce battle ensues, resulting in Zemo's death, but not before a shot from Zemo's gun hits and kills Bucky. The story ends with a distraught Steve mourning the loss of his friend, and the possibility of Rick Jones becoming the new Captain America.<ref>''What If?'' (vol. 1) #5 (Oct 1977)</ref>
* "What If...Captain America Fought in the Civil War?" features a continuum where Captain America lived during the [[American Civil War]]. In this universe, Steve Rogers is a corporal attached to a Northern regiment called the [[Redlegs]], led by Colonel Buck "Bucky" Barnes. Rogers's first mission turns out to be an attack on a group of civilians, and he refuses to follow Barnes' orders.  Barnes shoots Rogers, but only wounds him after Barnes is attacked by an eagle.  Rogers passes out while trying to escape, and has visions of We-pi-ahk the Eagle-Chief.  Waking, he is greeted by a black man, [[Falcon (comics)|Private Wilson]], who brought him back to an Indian reserve. Wilson believes Steve's vision of We-pi-ahk means he is destined to be the one that will bring union to all people. Wilson begins a mystical ceremony that he says will make Rogers "as you are on the inside, so shall you become on the outside."  Barnes breaks into the hut as the ceremony is underway.  Rogers is mystically given superhuman strength and a magical shield that can transform into an eagle, while Barnes' head is turned into a fleshless skull.  Barnes orders his men to open fire and kill everyone in the camp, and Wilson is fatally shot.  Before the troops can escape, Rogers appears as Captain America, and captures Barnes and his men.  Thanks to Captain America's involvement, the Civil War ends earlier than in our history, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] is never assassinated.  Rogers helps the South rebuild after the war, and suppresses the rise of the [[Ku Klux Klan|K.K.K.]] As a representative of the Indian people, he is able to prevent the [[Indian wars]] of 1870. Unfortunately Barnes, now known as the White Skull, forms a group even more dangerous than the K.K.K. The descendants of both men continue fighting each other up to the present in this alternative universe.<ref>''What If: Captain America'' (vol. 1) #1 (Feb 2006)</ref>
* In the 2006 ''What If [[Age of Apocalypse]]'' one shot, Captain America is the leader of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] (this reality's version of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]), alongside [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] (not bonded with any [[adamantium]]), [[Captain Britain]] (who uses Iron Man's armor), [[Brother Voodoo]] (this reality's [[Sorcerer Supreme]], after [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]'s death), [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] (who has a prosthetic arm), the [[Molecule Man]], [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], and [[Nate Grey|Nate Summers]]. Captain America no longer wears a mask, and wields [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], along with his [[Captain America's shield|shield]].<ref>''What If? X-Men Age of Apocalypse'' #1 (February, 2007)</ref>
