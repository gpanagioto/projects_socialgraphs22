'''Frankenstein''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] character based on the [[Frankenstein's monster]] character created by [[Mary Shelley]].

==Publication history==
Frankenstein, obviously based upon [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein's monster|famous character]] from the novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818), was created in 1948 by [[Edmond Hamilton]] and [[Bob Kane]] in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #135.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=114}}</ref>

A later reworking was developed by [[Len Wein]] as the ''Spawn of Frankenstein'' concept. The monster fell under the thrall of [[Count Dracula]]. They often battled against [[Superman]], [[Batman]], or the [[Phantom Stranger]]. He appeared in ''The Phantom Stranger'' (vol. 2) #23-30 (February 1973-May 1974), ''[[Action Comics]]'' #531 (May 1982), and ''[[The Young All-Stars]]'' #18-19 (Novemberâ€“December 1988).

A third Frankenstein Monster appears in ''Superman'' #344 (February 1980), along with Count Dracula. These both come from "The World of Nightmare" and battle Superman, the Phantom Stranger, and [[Cassandra Craft]].

Frankenstein's latest revamping was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Doug Mahnke]] in 2005 and is similar to [[Doc Frankenstein]]. He is one of the [[Seven Soldiers]], and bears a resemblance to the creature as portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]] in the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film]] directed by [[James Whale]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=303}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Frankenstein is an [[undead]] body composed of parts from several corpses stitched together, created by Victor Frankenstein some time in the 19th century. He was assumed dead in the [[Arctic]] when he sank beneath the ice, but he survived and swam to America, having 'many adventures'. He was revived by Victor Adam, He vowed vengeance against Adam for restoring him to life, successfully killing him, but accidentally bringing about a coma for [[Doctor Thirteen]]'s wife, Maria, in the process.<ref>''The Phantom Stranger'' (vol. 2) #23-24. DC Comics.</ref> In particular, Frankenstein became a frequent enemy of [[Sheeda#Sheeda characters|Melmoth]], who he referred to as the Ringmaster of the Circus of Maggots. In a climactic battle in the year 1870, Frankenstein faced Melmoth and stopped him from destroying [[Vanity (comics)|a town]] with maggot-hominids. The fight took place on a moving train, which was derailed during the conflict, and Frankenstein's fate was unknown.

In 2005, a high school student, called 'Uglyhead' by all the other children, acquires telepathic abilities through contact with the Sheeda, which he uses to torment his peers. At the senior prom, the now-docile students are killed by the Sheeda maggot-hominids. This causes the return of Frankenstein, who had survived in a state of hibernation underneath the town, who makes short work of the maggot-hominids and the boy, before burning down the school to cover the bodies. Afterwards, Frankenstein tracks down Melmoth and makes his way to Mars through an "Erdel Gate" (a reference to [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Dr. Saul Erdel|Dr. Saul Erdel]], the scientist who first transported the [[Martian Manhunter]] to Earth). On Mars, Frankenstein confronts Melmoth once again. Frankenstein frees the children Melmoth has enslaved to work in his gold mines, and feeds Melmoth to the flesh-eating, praying mantis-like horses of Mars. Before he is consumed, Melmoth reveals that it was not lightning that brought the monster to life, but several drops of his own immortal blood, sold to Frankenstein's creator, that still course through Frankenstein's veins.

In the third issue of the series, Frankenstein meets an old acquaintance greatly resembling the "Bride" in [[James Whale]]'s film ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', albeit with two extra arms grafted onto her by the Red Swami, a supervillain who brainwashed her into thinking she was the reincarnation of an assassin goddess.<ref>''Seven Soldiers: Frankenstein'' #3 (April 2006). DC Comics.</ref> She is now an agent of the Super Human Advanced Defense Executive ([[S.H.A.D.E.]]), a secret government agency, which temporarily drafts Frankenstein as well. Of their previous relationship, she says: "It's nothing personal, but you were never my type".

In the final issue, he stows away on a time-ship which brings him to the Sheeda realm in the distant future. There, he destroys their world-destroying fleet, kills the Sheeda-Queen's time-yacht's steersman, and hijacks her ship to the present. Once in the present, though, [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] gains control of Frankenstein using a witch-brand and forces him to take the castle back to the future.

He appears briefly in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, which takes place one week after the ''Frankenstein'' miniseries. He is seen fighting against [[General Wade Eiling]]. Frankenstein is armed with a three-foot-long sword, which he claims once belonged to the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], and a large antique pistol, which he calls his 'steam-gun'.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>

A character called [[Young Frankenstein (comics)|Young Frankenstein]] has appeared in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' as a member of the team during the "Lost Year" covered by ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''. Young Frankenstein is apparently killed by [[Black Adam]] during [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]], but actually survives.<ref>As shown in the ''Infinite Halloween Special'' and ''Countdown to Mystery'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

Frankenstein and S.H.A.D.E appear in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #3, also written by Grant Morrison. He again appears two issues later, leading a squad of superheroes against [[Darkseid]]'s forces, who are led by [[Kalibak]]. He is also seen in the final issue fighting in humanity's last stand before [[Superman]] gets the Miracle Machine working. Frankenstein is immune to Darkseid's weapon, the [[Anti-Life Equation]], because he is already dead.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>

Frankenstein confronts [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] in the latter's current limited series, and again during the ''[[Blackest Night]]''.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #66 (November 2009). DC Comics.</ref> Grundy, having been transformed into a [[Black Lantern]], rips out Frankenstein's heart. Due to having an extra one in his chest, Frankenstein survives this attack.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #67 (December 2009). DC Comics.</ref>

A version of the character appears in a spinoff of the 2011 alternate-timeline crossover event [[Flashpoint (comics)]].  The three-issue series was titled ''Flashpoint: Frankenstein & the Creatures of the Unknown''.<ref>Grand Comics Database https://www.comics.org/series/59188/ </ref>

As part of ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), a new ongoing series ''Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.'' was released, based on the [[Seven Soldiers]] version of Frankenstein. It was initially written by [[Jeff Lemire]] and drawn by Alberto Ponticelli. [[Matt Kindt]] replaced Lemire with issue #10 and stayed with the book until it was cancelled with issue #16.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Dark- September DC solicitations |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/09/the-dark/ |work=The Source |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref name=cbr32686>{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Renaud |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32686 |title=Lemire Discovers the Dark Sides of "Animal Man" & "Frankenstein" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 8, 2011 |access-date=September 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Truitt |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/story/2011-09-12/Frankenstein-series-electrifies-DC-Comics-New-52/50365414/1 |title=It's alive!

The character appears next in seven issues of both the ''[[New 52]]'' ''Batman and Robin'' and the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' ''Superman'', both written by [[Peter Tomasi]] and drawn by [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]]. Later in 2018, the ''Seven Soldiers'' briefly reunite in ''[[Sideways (comics)|Sideways]]'', then in 2019 ''Frankenstein'' forms a team of fellow monsters to once again stop Melmoth in ''Gotham City Monsters''.
