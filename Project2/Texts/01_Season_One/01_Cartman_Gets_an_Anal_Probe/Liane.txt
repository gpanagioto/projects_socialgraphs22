How are you doing? Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise. You're not fat, you're big boned. You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you? Just a weensy eensy woo woo? How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then? Yes, hon? Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too? Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight! Eric, look who's here. That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.  Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.
