Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning on the news. Uh, well, actually it ''is'' kind of a big deal, Stan. It may be a mistake, but ''you'' don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal. That's easy for you to say, Stan. That doesn't mean I can just be fine. If you ''really'' think it's not a big deal, then you ''really'' are ignorant. That's all. I'm not ''fighting'' anybody.  Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.  You just don't get it, Stan!  Sooo black people are midgets?  I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it! No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either! Nothing! No! Now you get it, Stan.  Thanks, dude.
