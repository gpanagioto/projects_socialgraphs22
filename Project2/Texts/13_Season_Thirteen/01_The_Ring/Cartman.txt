Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it? Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend. Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.  Butters, what's the problem? That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face! Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's. Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.  He took it pretty well. The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you?   Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!  Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis? Well well well, here he comes. It's B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear. Purity ring?  ''Grey's Anatomy''?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?  Motherfucker! "Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this!  Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes! This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  The hell did you do to us?!  I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said. And knowing is half the battle.}}
