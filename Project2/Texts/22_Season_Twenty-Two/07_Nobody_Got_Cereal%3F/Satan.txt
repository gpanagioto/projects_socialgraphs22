Rroooowwwwwrrrrr!!  Foolish mortals! Your time is nigh! Face your end! I was told to come here by the spirit of Al Gore.  A deal was made. We do not know by whom. But this demon has grown stronger, and no mortal can do anything to stop it. Why would I help mankind?  I... must admit, people up here on Earth have been doing a lot of my work for me lately. Maybe... maybe it is time I did something for them.   I'm sorry. Everyone dies. I just wish I could have helped you.  Oh God, it hurts. You have to. You have to keep trying. You have to keep trying!!   Goodbye.
