Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV! Oh, well that's good. ...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago. Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it? Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche? Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are! What are we goin' to do, Sharon?? Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to ''prove'' something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish. Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.   NOOOOOOOOOOO! OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again. Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago. Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO!
