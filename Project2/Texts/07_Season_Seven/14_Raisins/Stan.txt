All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen. Football. Okay. 23!  What?   Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me? 'Cause I need to know why she broke up.  Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her? What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me. Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy! Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me? Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me. She's a continuing source of inspiration to me. Well?  Jesus...  ...Go away. Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone? You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken... Can we go, please? No, dude, I feel worse! Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life! I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control!  Something I should have done a long time ago.  Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me ''right now! [Bebe rolls her eyes and sighs]'' All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need ''her'' friends to do it! Tell her I love her!  Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?  I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else. There's nothing else I ''can'' do. She ''was'' my whole life. Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I ''should'' hang with the Goth kids. But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living? All right, so how do I join you? ...'K.  Yeah. They're not? Well I don't drink coffee.  So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so. What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token? Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?  ...conformist. Butters? What's the matter with you? Huh? But you just got dumped. No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all. He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. As Cartman would you say, Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.   Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Yeah. Let's play ball.
