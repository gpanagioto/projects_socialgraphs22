 Oh, okay, Kyle. Sounds good! Thanks, buddy! Hey, we trust you, Kyle!  Say, Kyle, we heard you have some COVID-19 vaccinations. Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. You know, if you think your teacher is worth saving more than us... Well, it sounds like that! Sounds like your teacher's life is more important than your mom and dad's!  School kind of abandoned you kids. But your parents, well... we didn't shove you off into a Zoom meeting, did we? You know, we're not spring chickens anymore.  The virus is still out there, Kyle, and it's still killing people. I don't know how you'd feel if mom or me got COVID and died in these last few months because you did nothing. Don't do nothing, Kyle. You know what, Kyle? Silence is violence, Kyle. Don't kill mom, buddy.   Hey, Garrison! Good job!
