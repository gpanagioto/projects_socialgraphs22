Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school? TGI Friday's? Yeah, okay. But...  See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers. You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome?   Whoooooo!  Aaah-oww! You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe! Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!  Huh? They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God! It's a dream come true!  What? You think so? Me neither.   Purity rings? Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring. No! I don't want to watch ''Grey's Anatomy'', Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken. Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway. Oh I feel better already! What say you and me... go to TGI Fridays?
