'''Mary Louise Dahl''', more commonly known as '''Baby-Doll''', is a [[DC Comics]] character and a repeat villain in the ''[[Batman]]'' franchise. The character first appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and reappeared again with a revamped [[Rhoda Penmark]]-like design in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. Baby-Doll later made small appearances in a select few DC comic books. She is known for being one of the few female ''Batman'' characters with a [[disability]], lacking the conventional "sexy" look of most other female villains and heroes in the franchise. The character was created by [[Paul Dini]], and her original voice actress was [[Alison La Placa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Baby-Doll |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519569/ |website=www.imdb.com |publisher=The Internet Movie Database |access-date=24 May 2022}}</ref> Her later voice actress was [[Laraine Newman]], whose voice was noticeably different to that of LaPlaca's; this was one of the few times that a ''Batman'' animated character had a voice acting change between seasons.

==History==
Baby-Doll has a form of [[dwarfism]] caused by systemic [[hypoplasia]], which affected her ability to physically grow, therefore she looks like a small child even in adulthood. [[Commissioner Gordon]] cites her actual age as 30 in her first ''Batman: the Animated Series'' episode appearance. Baby-Doll was the child starlet of a sitcom titled ''Love That Baby'' (a mishmash parody of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]''). As the sitcom dwindled in popularity, Baby-Doll was replaced by a character called "Cousin Spunky", who humiliated her and, in her view, stole her spotlight. Tired of playing silly roles, the then-adult Baby-Doll quit ''Love That Baby'' and went off on her own, trying for a career in dramatic acting. Due to her physical appearance as a little girl, she was unable to be taken seriously in dramatic roles, and she went into seclusion. Baby-Doll's childlike appearance affected her friendships, romantic prospects and career, something that she was bitter about for most of her life. Baby-Doll is a career criminal for the most part, a skilled con artist, bank robber, kidnapper and white-collar criminal who uses her small stature to her advantage. She can pose as a little girl in public, making herself appear innocuous and unsuspected in juxtaposition with other female DC Comics villains. At a later point in her life, Baby-Doll is rehabilitated temporarily and finds gainful employment as a concierge, but she is harassed for her disability and snaps at them.

Baby-Doll's character design appears in ''Batman: the Animated Series'' as a [[Shirley Temple]]-like figure with golden hair in ringlets and a purple dress with a [[diaper]] beneath it. In ''The New Batman Adventures'', the character heavily appears like little girl character [[Rhoda Penmark]] from ''[[The Bad Seed (1956 film)|The Bad Seed]]'', with pale hair in longer pigtails, pale skin, black lipstick and black eyeliner, and a pink dress with a skater skirt and puffy sleeves. This redesigned ''The New Batman Adventures'' design of the character continued to be the more prominent and popular appearance of the character, carried over into toys and comic books.

Baby-Doll had a female mercenary for-hire named Mariam in her ''Batman: the Animated Series'' appearance. Mariam did any of the physical things that Baby-Doll was unable to do herself due to her stature. Mariam was a redheaded adult woman with thick glasses, a pink necktie and a black [[Power dressing|power suit]].

==First appearance==
Baby-Doll first appears in the ''Batman: the Animated Series'' episode "Baby Doll". With the help of Mariam, Baby-Doll kidnaps the cast of ''Love That Baby'', all of whom have since aged since their roles as Baby-Doll's family on the series. Batman and Robin discover Baby-Doll's lair, and learn that her plot is to violently force her former co-stars to keep on reenacting new episodes of ''Love That Baby'' so that she can nostalgically role-play as the one character that people loved to watch. Batman chases Baby-Doll into a house of mirrors at a nearby carnival in [[Gotham City|Gotham]], where she comes upon a reflection of herself resembling a grown woman. This causes her to mentally break down and shoot at the mirrors with a gun until she runs out of bullets, after which she sobs as Batman comforts her.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beepe |first1=Joseph |title=10 Times Batman Showed His Soft Side |url=https://screenrant.com/batman-times-he-showed-soft-compassionate-caring-side/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=ScreenRant |access-date=24 May 2022}}</ref>

==Second appearance==
Baby-Doll reappears in ''The New Batman Adventures'' episode "Love Is a Croc". Here, the character has given up criminal activity and acting, rehabilitated and employed as a [[motel]] [[concierge]]. A drunk tourist recognizes her as Baby-Doll and harasses her, causing her to violently slam his head between the covers of a book before fleeing into her own room in the building, where she coincidentally comes across the court trial of villain [[Killer Croc]] on TV. She feels that she and Croc are kindred spirits, both judged by their physical appearances rather than their personalities. After setting Croc free from jail, the pair begin a romantic relationship. Their life is supplemented by a series of robberies, but their relationship fractures after Baby-Doll catches Croc chatting with two strippers about dumping Baby-Doll once he has enough money to move on. Furious, Baby-Doll attempts to hijack a [[nuclear reactor]] to kill herself and Croc, but [[Barbara Gordon]] intervenes and saves the reactor. Croc tries to kill Baby-Doll, grabbing an industrial pipe full of scalding hot water, which severely burns him. Baby-Doll stays by his side as he falls unconscious.

==Other media==
Baby-Doll is one of the only female ''Batman'' villains, along with [[Calendar Girl (DC Comics)|Calendar Girl]] from ''The New Batman Adventures'' episode "Mean Seasons", to not appear in the webseries ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' or the animated adult cartoon ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]''. Baby-Doll did, however, make a few appearances after ''Batman: the Animated Series''. The character made an appearance in the ''Li'l Gotham'' DC Comics series, and later in the issue "Secret Santa" of ''[[Batman: The Adventures Continue]]'' in 2020.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nguyen |first1=Dustin |last2=Fridolfs |first2=Derek |title=Batman: Li'L Gotham #3 |date=2013 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Burnett |first1=Alan |last2=Dini |first2=Paul |title=Batman: The Adventures Continue Season One |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=9781779507891}}</ref> It is unclear why the Baby-Doll character was never more widely-prominent in ''Batman'' media. Baby-Doll was noted for [[Disability in the media|disability representation]] by ''[[The Mary Sue]]'', with reporter D.R. Medlin recalling of the character, "it is so heartbreaking that she just wanted to be seen and feel normal".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Medlin |first1=D.R. |title=Hot Take: The Villains in ‘Batman the Animated Series’ Might Be the Best in the Entire Franchise |url=https://www.themarysue.com/best-batman-the-animated-series-villains/ |website=www.themarysue.com |publisher=The Mary Sue |access-date=24 May 2022}}</ref>

A collectible plastic figurine of Baby-Doll (based on her design in ''The New Batman Adventures'') was offered alongside a plastic figurine of Killer Croc in 2016, made by [[DC Direct]].<ref>{{cite web |title=dc direct KILLER CROC BABY DOLL batman animated collectibles universe |url=https://www.actionfiguresandcomics.com/products/dc-direct-killer-croc-baby-doll-batman-animated-collectibles-universe?variant=20049601593440 |website=www.actionfiguresandcomics.com |publisher=Action Figures and Comics |access-date=24 May 2022}}</ref>

She also appears in ''Batman: White Knight'' #3-4, as part of a group of mind-controlled villains. She later appears in the sequel storyline ''Batman: Curse of the White Knight'', being among the villains murdered by [[Azrael (DC Comics)|Azrael]].
