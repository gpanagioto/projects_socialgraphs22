Throw it here! Throw it here!  They are trying to save Clyde's mom. They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again. We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened. So then we can't sue him? Wow, really?! How expensive?  Yeah. So what does that mean?   Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.  It happens to be worth six thousand dollars! Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money! No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash. ...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside. Fifteen bucks?! Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of!  Yeah! Here's one.  Yeah dude, you can test them.  This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V! I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo.  A six-layer burrito? Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen? But, how do they get away with that? What are you talking about? Grandpa?  Grandpa. She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa. She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen. Yes, Grandpa. Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this!  Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself? I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself? I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself. No I wouldn't. No, because I really want you to kill yourself. I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot! Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself. I'm not joking.  Do it. Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do! Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!" YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions! You're not?  Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work. So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it. Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something.  Yeah. Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore. Tango, Tango, I'm in position. It will have to do. We're not getting closer. I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it. Go, go, go. Oh, that's a good idea. Dude, we are on the front page! Can we get The Denver Post, please?  It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.  Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.  "Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive." That's all it is?  Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe. Well, I'm glad we took care of that. That's a cool idea What seems pointless? No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.  Oh, hey, guys. How's it going?  Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out. Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants.   Okay, that's good, a little higher. OK, whenever you're ready. Alright, go Cartman. Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.  Fox trot standing by at position alpha. Standing by in three seconds. Come on, dude. Hurry. Wow! Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again? That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher. Well then write the principal an anonymous letter. I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore! I'll do it! I'll be in charge. No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped. Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight! Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it. Butters, you're the star of the video! Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle? Kyle? Kyle, dude, where are you going?! To stop bullying. YES. ...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Do you realize that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of- Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference! What the hell does that mean? Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video! Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters! I know, right?!  Oh, hey. Huh? But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I- No.  What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release? Butters is totally fine with it, dude. Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?! Oh yeah. This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle! ...What, what was the question again? ...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!  Why does he keep saying that? Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it.  I didn't know. I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me! Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on? Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it? How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?  Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.  I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do. Kyle!  Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle!   No! Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here! Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do? I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off. Yeah.  Good. How are you? ...Shuttle? Uh that's okay. Thank God.  I think we're good.  Oh, really?? There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead. Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?! Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay? Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?  Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick. ...Yyyeah. Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go. Yea, please! You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all. Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up! No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!  You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there! We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay! Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?!  ...Kenny? Kenny!   Stop it! It was me! My idea. Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.   I had no idea ziplining would be so boring. Thank you.  What?  Dude, why are you so into their relationship? Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago. You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports. The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore. Dad, do we really have to wear bras? This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team! Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.  I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.  The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory. Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know? Cartman, you idiot! Dad? What? Whoa, whoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do! Oh, right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets! We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere? Yeah Dad. You need some of this.  You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman? Whoa duude! They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front.  Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo? Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing. I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?  Dude! Dude, not cool! Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out. Yeah dude. It's really serious. Dude, you okay?  Dude, what happened? What's this?  Whoa! But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex?  Well are you gonna tell your dad? Cartman dude, not now. You're gonna have to tell him, dude. What? You're talking about Butters. Butters? Butters, come out here. Hawaii?   "On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?  We're rich?  Blockbuster Video? Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad.  It's awesome. You should try to get it on that ''Ancient Civilizations'' show so that people can see how cultures used to live.  I think something might be wrong with Dad? Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.  Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!  Dad, nobody's gonna come. Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!  I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle! I know, but there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion. No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him. Oh never mind, I hate him again. Yeah. How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home. Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house. Trick or treat. Trick or treat. What? What's he doing? Hey, where did you guys go? All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?! Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise! No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt No no! We weren't gonna go there! NO!  What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No! What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone. Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that? Oh, ah thank God you found me. You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe!  They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble. Guys, you're okay! It's all right, just a scratch. No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash. Yeah, people are gonna get hurt. Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover. Oops. Hey, be careful in there. It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps. Wait a minute. There they are! Listen everybody, those guys right over there are-   Hey dude. It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me. Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny? Stay gold.  It's all right, Dad. All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop. Yeah I know. Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal. I don't know,  I just like it. Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off. ...I don't know.  I like it. No, I just, I don' know. No. I have? You're wearing a bracelet to think of me? You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters? ...Farmers in where? Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands? Wow, this is happening so fast.  for standing. No thanks. I'll stand. I'm good. Tell the captain to take off.  For what? No! This is stupid! No! I never cut if off! What's the big idea, Craig?! You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people! You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside! And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out! Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute! Yeah.  Thanks Kyle. Why does it matter?! You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!  Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?! You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it! Jesus! What are you doing here? Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything? Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that. It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial. Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair. Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles? NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue. Pff it's like, that's here  and... Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important! Exactly! People don't even know where it is. How can we raise awareness? Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets... Our... scause? Dude, the hell just happen? People are saying that?  Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.   It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along. We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company. Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.  Wow, really? That's pretty impressive. But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night. I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me. Is that an M&M? Pry his mouth open! What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? Huh? Oh, Red Lobster. Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up? There's nothing here, Kyle.  He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President. Oh my God you guys, look!  Aw shit, it's him again. Well, we tried, dude. Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much? Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer? Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010? Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, get up here! Hurry!   What is that? That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde. No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! ''Put it down!''   There you are! Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant! What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom? How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again. No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina. You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go. Clyde! Clyde!  Clyde, I want you to know I don't blame you for this. We should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up. Shhh! Sh! I.. don't... have a lot of time, Clyde. Just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake, please. Oh, God, please let me go. Let me go. Do it! Do it! Do it!  Clyde? Clyde?  This lawyer is a fraud. He has been swindling you and your friends for your money. You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde! Don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something I have asked you time and time again to do.  It's your fault! A toilet? Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay? Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please? Mom? Why? Mom, I'm in class.  But she's not gonna die, is she? Mom, I'm sorry. Mom? So that's it? Mom? That's not what I said.  You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork! You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bull-crap bullying video! What's she look like? I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused. Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit.   We don't have a coach, Kyle. Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters. Lying jerk!  There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic. Yes you do.   Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.  Of course, man. It's cool.  Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die. His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay." I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom. Nuh-uh. Mom, get the door!  Who are these buttholes? My potty? What are they going to do to it?  Hey, hey! That's my bathroom!  Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump. Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine. This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line! Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now! What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls? Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms. Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in. Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right? Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance? Oh boy, here we go. So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot. Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?  Nice bolo tie, Stan. Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one. No, dude, it's... badass. ...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck. You may suck our collective balls, sir!  I told you guys. I've been watching all day. This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend.   That's right.  Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math! Hey Craig. Goin' on? Tolkien! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-  Butters, what the fuck?! "My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business!  Oh ahhhh, three bucks. We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people. Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the ring just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello? YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...? Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys? Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am. Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!" Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth. Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award. Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!  Yeah, listen, I'm running a resale business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours. I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings. Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there. And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred. How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.  What d'ja say? Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff? Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it! Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you! My balls, my balls, suck 'em dry...  Motherfucker!  You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!  -and then tried to fuck me out of your business! No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!  I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go. Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys.  Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late.  Oh, God. That was boring. Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there. Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation. Why would we look at a newspaper, retard? Really?  Yes! What's it say, what's it say? What? Let me see that.  Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that? You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog.  I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys. How is this Kyle? This good?   Cool, these will be good uploads. Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here? Why don't you make me?  Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  Bad Mr. Kitty! I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting. Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her. Dude, what's going on? Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?  Come on, Kyle. It's okay, man, come on. Get a couple facing the other way, brah.  I know. I know Kyle.  I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  No, no. It was kind of stupid, really. And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff.   Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good? No, kitty, you have to be quiet. No kitty! That's a bad kitty!   Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous! Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time. SHUT UP, KITTY! Let's do this.   <poem><i>We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.</i></poem> Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days? Interesting, and why is it called Passover again?  So interesting, wow.  Oh, hey, Kyle. Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton. Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith? Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park. All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.   Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all. Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything. Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter. It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...  Yeah-uh, Tolkien! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!  Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell. Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing. I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence? Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.  Butters. Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera. Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real. Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in. Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here. You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night ''and'' has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  He's here somewhere. JESUS IS A LIE! Shh! Help me call it out, Butters. Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST! No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters? Sh! You hear that? I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us. It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins. I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath.  We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here.  That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank. Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe!  Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it. People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron. These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid! I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra. It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy. Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified. Heh. What do you mean?  Well, I mean it could have just been a dog? Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive. Why? There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle? Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle?   Guys?! Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!  You guys?! GUYS! It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys? Wingstreet?! Dude, I want wings!  Oh Jesus, it's only you! HUH?! Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP! OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-? This isn't safe or fun! NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance. Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble. It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  Bobo?! Bobo, no!   Ugh... what... where... Ugh... what?  What's going on? It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs? So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle. Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind. What does that mean? Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no? You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick!  Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs? But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave. Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that.  But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys. I love you, dad. <poem><i>And our love grows</i></poem> No, Kyle! I don't believe you! Noooo!  Noooooo!  Noooo!  No! The bread's all flat! No!  We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...!   No! No! The bread is all flat! No!  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah, I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learned a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ. Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Knowing your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe. I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying. Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle, happy Passover. Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember. He has a point. I have balls. Still balls. 'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl.  We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come!  The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO! Somebody help us!  Kyle, hurry!   Oh God! Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes. Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude. No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes. Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool! Ziplining. Hell yeah. Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross. Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die. Alright! ...No. Finally! Well, come on, we don't have a choice.  Mmmm, no? The trees' biology? Yeah.  Yeah. Zipliiine.  Totally fuckin' stupid, dude! Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit! NOOOO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!   We should have never listened to you, Kyle. Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!" I brought it up because you already brought it up! Fuck you Kyle! Nnnn-mo... Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy!  This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast. If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle! NOOO!   Eeeeugh. Uh oh.  A marina? Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew! Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes! No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard! You?!  You came for us! What?  Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most. Oh my God. Tolkien, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Tolkien. I'm happy for you. Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?  What the? ...Oh, Tolkien's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Tolkien! Yeah, get in there. ...Tolkien. You want me to pass her a jelly bean? Huh? Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.   Dude, dude. Dude.  Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Tolkien? Well, Tolkien's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know. Yeah, of course.  Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move? Thanks, you guys. WHAT?! KYLE?!  Motherfucker!  Hey, ah, Nichole, right? Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle? Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together? Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had. Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out. Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch.  Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.  Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Tolkien and Nichole are gonna be practically married. No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push. Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys!   Oh my God, sooo cute.  Ohhhhh my God. You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me.  Did you see that? Tolkien was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead.  I don't know, it's just so... perfect.  Kyle, Jesus Christ! Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you? Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Tolkien and Nichole! They belong together! Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence they ended up together?! Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that. Shh, quiet, Cupid Me. Nothing. Nobody. Why, Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Tolkien and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?! Come on!  Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?! That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?! Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts. You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you!  I'm gonna get you!  I almost got you! Almost!  Everything's great, Mom.   It's not fair! They were so... happy! It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other! No, they won't! No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole! And you! I should have never believed in you!  That's right... That's right!  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you. Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything. Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars.  Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do. Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important. Denver Nuggets game?  Nooooooo!  No time! NOOOOOOO! Attention! Attention please!  I swear, Kyle.  Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously you guys, you gotta see it. It's the Bat-Mobile! It's outside. Oh my gohhhd, so cute!  That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together. Really?! What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me! Hey, stop it! Nooo! That's right, Butters. Yeah, you know what?  Screw this! That's true.  Stan, hook up my bra. Who needs a coach? We have Butters. Butters, you understand this game better than anybody. Hey Butters, you got a minute? I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor. No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters. ...I don't have a dad. You save it all? Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else? Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.  Holy shit I think I do. That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off. That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.   I'm not fat, Kyle. Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like that bitch!  See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.  Holy hell yes! Yeah... Yeah, here you go.  Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?  All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.  Sweeeeeeeeeet! Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket on the front for my candy corn Oreos.    Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  It's the law.   Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line! Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it. And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy? Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well.  What, Kyle?!   You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?! Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo! Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick.  It is a violation of my civil rights, Tolkien, and you should be ashamed of yourself! Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Tolkien, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air! What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!   Nobody takes ''my'' ratings! I'm pissed! Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed! I ain't done with you, bitch!  Dude, no way!  Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual? Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom? No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security! Oh no, really? Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom! What-what do you mean? Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle ''is'' always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew! Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both! Oh fuck.  Hello? Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm! Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew. Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere. Sorry about this. 'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!  That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!  I do, but ''you'' don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit! You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white! Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped! He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry! Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!  Who is there? Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello? A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?! Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on! Heh- hello? No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?! Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me! Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?! Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom!   Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look else''where''. Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that ''this'' fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT! What?  Hello? Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity. Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs. No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs. My password is uloveboobs! You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?! Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.  Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.   FELLAS! Fellas! You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson! It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him! Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom!  Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny?  ...Wow. Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls.  Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii. He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut. Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more.  We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together. Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters? Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.  You'll just have to wait and see.  Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America! This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it! Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"   I'm not Bruce Vilanch! The Incredible... No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green! The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!  That's right! Dude dude dude! Check it out.   You guys, we've gotta stop it! Cartman SMASH!   Holy shit, they shot this guy! Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online? Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!  I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool. All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?! Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him? Uh huh. So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet! The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it! Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this! Craig?! You asshole!  Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them? Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic! ...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.  Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle. ...Fuck! Dude, weak.  Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy? MOM! She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost. Mom? Where's my mom?  "Warm nuts", she said. Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!  No way dude. No way. MOOOM! I can't find my mooom! Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old.  MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!  Hey Kyle. What's up? Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you. Please, Kyle. It's kind of important. You happy with the election results last night, Kyle? Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election?  What if I did, Kyle? Pretty sweet, huh? What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states. No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.   Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone. Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan. Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.  Hmmm, no. I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission. Ey! You can't do that! Ey! I know my rights! Stop right now!  I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing. But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time.  Mm, mhm, mhm. They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit. Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it? Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted. So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker. Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso.  Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters? I guess we learned that when it comes to ''Star Wars'', we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you. Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  A place in town people barely even know exists. Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese! Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose ''Star Wars'' to the Chinese forever! I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that! I want a part in the new movies! I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca. Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun. Haha. Haha.   Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle? No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?!  Is your mom always like that dude? Cartman, it was actually really lame. I know, fatass. I was there. That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny. Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde? Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all.  What's going on? From what? Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener. So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody. All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet. Aw, he's dead?  You hear that Clyde? Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance  What? That... was six grand? Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it. Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else! Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere. You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito! Dude, that's terrible! That's the chemical equation for gold? ...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up? Yeah! What does that mean?  Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!" We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa! What's he doing?  Copy, tango. Clear vantage point? Alright, Butters. Bring it in. Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman. Go Cartman!  So, what do you want to do now? You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you? How can that be? Already? How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade. But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense. Yep, that's great.  Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now? W-what's the matter, Kenny? Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright? We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting? Benedict Arnold.  Kenny? You guys are sellouts. You're freaking sellouts!  Yeah, good idea.   We have to face it, Cartman. I really thought it was gonna last. It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean- I-It's good that it became something else. Yeah, that's awesome. What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting. It's super awesome. Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango. Two, one. Go Cartman! Cartman? Go, Cartman.  Yeah. Do it, Cartman.  Get out of here. Get. Outta here!   What are you gonna do? No? What does that have to do with Passover? Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies. I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.  If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you! Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth! These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid. What are you doing? Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.  Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry. That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys! It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart! It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go. That's just how God is. This is what God told us to do! You'll see!  Yeah.  I know, you're not.  Where's your lunch, Butters? Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters. Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her? <poem><i>Pansy.</i></poem> He doesn't wanna do it, dude.  Why are you doing this, Stan? You're gonna stop bullying. With Cartman singing about his vagina. Don't, ''don't'' act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you! Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego.  Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker? I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put all over signs as the poster child for bullying? Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him, and neither do you! What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom! Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them. If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!  If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet, for free?!  AAAAAAAH! I can't take it!  We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide We've definitely not done that before! Cool! Ziplining. We don't mind. Jesus Christ! How, how long do we have to take the shuttle? Dude, did you fart?! Well? How was it, Cartman? Zipline.  E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done? STOP! Wugh!  It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.  Me?! Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up! You fat piece of shit! DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?! The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass! You're in a forest! Go take a crap! Oh, thank God! AAAAH!  Can we please go faster?! AAAAAAAAAAH! Just go. Go without me. I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan. What's the point? Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea! Ziplining was your idea, you fatass! Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water! Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew! Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS! IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD! So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?! You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?! You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan!  Mr. Hankey! Just tell us, Butters.  Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me! Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right? Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know? Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys! Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya!   You motherfucker!  What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?! The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her! Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage! What? Who is Cupid Me? You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple! Goddamnit!  Hey man. You okay?  What happened? It just didn't work out? So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... It's done?  So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available? Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy? Huh?  Dude, what the fuck? That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Tolkien 'cause he thinks blacks belong together!  We don't have kickoffs anymore.   This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?! We don't even understand how this game is played. Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."? But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday! We can't.  Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat. Right, you're not fat. Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy?  Why do they even allow those things in stores? You've gotta be kidding me! Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  Why?  Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-  Oh no! You don't need that! Get off of it. That's ''not'' what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman! What?? So take a shit somewhere else! You have got to be kidding me! We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over! So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up! Who's Honey Boo Boo? Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore. Come on, hurry it up in there!   How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?! Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness! Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary? You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right. Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera!  Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Tolkien. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue.  Fatty Doo Doo? What?  What have you done? When we said "documentary," I thought we meant ''60 Minutes'', not Honey Boo Boo! You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying ''that'' hard. Tolkien, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame?? When the bar gets lowered, Tolkien, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy? I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman? Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo Boo. What?  What? Oh my God. I'm sorry Tolkien, I had to tell him. His life is in danger. You found a network to buy it? I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?   Huh? I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance. Ike, what's the matter?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this? I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%- Oh no... You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do. Take a look.  Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man. Yeah dude.  Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time. I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing. What? It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea. I know... What?! Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch! The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing! Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet. And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself.  Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you? Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  Mom? You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!  Dude, come down here! Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man? Butters?  Why? Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just- What? Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him. Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.  Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America? But what about the costume contest?! Stan can't come. Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore? Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad? Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea. All right, where should we trick-or-treat first? He looks fine. We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh- Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.  Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!  Oh, sorry dude.  For Odin! For Asgard! Oh my God! And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend. Stan!  What happened to you? Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something! Stan? The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us! You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER? Did you do it? What are you people talking about? Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you. You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet? Because you kind of made it matter. S-so you did superglue it. Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this. Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week. Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello? Nothing, watching the election results. What?! Alright, what is this all about, fatass?! It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president. Sure you do! Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election?  What the hell is this? I don't believe it. Why do you have these? Dude! Knock it off, Cartman! You're not getting away with this, you fat turd!  This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it. Upstairs! First door to the left! But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country! Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them! Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election! Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them! Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter. God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!  Butters, you know something, don't you?!  What did Cartman tell you?! Tell us what you know right now! Then you have to tell us! Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it!  Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?! Can we please just try and talk to him? Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to! I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President! Then just tell me what Cartman is up to! What?  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!  Where? What? All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama? Wait a minute, the rights to ''Star Wars'', the movies? What the hell is going on here?! Anything in the basement, Jimmy? Well keep looking. Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.  We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and- Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken.  What?  It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House. It matters, Stan. It it matters.  Oh my God. Look! There they are! We found it, you guys!  No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people! Protect it? Well... if you put it that way... I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing. My grandma is from Virginia.  A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!   Sorry. My arms hurt.  We aren't makin' that much, fellas. Oh sorry, sorry.  Sorry!   Equipment is flying in, ten seconds. AAAA!!! AAAA!!! AAAA!!! What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw? Well, count me out. Well, I'm scared.  Oh, that's okay. I think... HA?!  Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun! You mean it's like, like a monster? AAAAAAHHH!  ''Lu lu lu, lu...'' N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways. AAAAAHHH! No, it's a school night! You think Jewpacabra is here? Oh good. Maybe we scared it off? Oh God, I'm scared. Eric, stop it! I'm not saying Jesus is a lie! Jesus is a lie? Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality. Oh, hamburgers. It's all quiet out front, Eric. He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes.   Hey, Eric. Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet.  Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.   OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways. ...Yeah.  Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale. Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy. Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin. My Grandma? Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second? Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone? I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma. Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma. No, you took it all!  My grandma?? Oh hamburgers!   HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma. Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me. Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it!   Yes... Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this. Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me. Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy.  Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow.  HAAAAA!   Oh uh, nothin'. Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.  Please, leave me alone. No it doesn't. Stop it! Grandma? I did it, Grandma.   AAAAH, fellas!  Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!  Guess! There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad. Look, look, there she is.  How come? Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other. Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room.   It's gonna be okay, Eric. They'll find love somewhere else. Yes, they will. In... In who, Eric? Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it. That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking. I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Err, what should I do with it? Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great! Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?! This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field! Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three! And when they try an-and ''thank'' you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile! And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the gooey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy! Huh? Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas. Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything. 'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes.   Woohoo''hoo''hoohoo! Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!   I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!  Okay Dad!  Wuh sure, Eric.  Uh-uh oh, no E-Eric, you're, why you're a great player. Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that? ...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings. My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it.  I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way.  Do you feel warm and compassionate? All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Tolkien! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss.  Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there? Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go.  Like me! 42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!   Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along. What's sarcasm and what's cum?  DAD! Hey, Dad! My wiener is all stiff and pointy! Thanks, Dad. Leave me alone! Get out of here, all of ya!      I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess! I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn! Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud!  It's not?! Yeah?  Hey yeah, all the time. Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?! Uhbu-but I'm from here. We're from Hawaii? But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period? They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua! Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!  Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go? Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian.  Yeah? Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny. Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come. You folks are all native Hawaiians too? What's "saimin"?  Whoa, it's like gasoline!  Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better. I've never done this before.  Aim... my anger! Stupid   No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks! He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?! Kenny, be careful! Kenny! Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything! Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!  Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!  Surrender?! No, the heck with that! Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes! No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! ''Argo'' is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!  Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez. What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better.  Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see ''Argo'', Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie! Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes? I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style. Come on! What are you guys goin' as? That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein! Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash.  Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying.  Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?" And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up." Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?  Well yeah.  I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone! Who? Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground! Go Stan! ...A little unnecessary, but go Stan! Prostitute!  Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers. Yeeah. Is it true? Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  Wu-what sound? Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason. Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why? He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more! I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it  It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Please, just leave me alone. Well... hah... HWAAAH!  Ah! Bah! I hate almonds.   What's up fellas? Bleh, ogayedmi. AGH! No! Please! You can't! Okay! Okay! He's helping the Chinese get something they want. Because the Chinese actually want to protect something that's important. At Red Robster.   Red Lobster!  Red Lobster!  Red Lobster! I didn't say anything. I promise. Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear! Betsy, come back home. It's just not that big a deal. What?! Can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing? Hang it there. You're going to be fine okay? Stay with me now.  I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do. When she fell into the toilet, she also made it flush. It created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides. Why did you leave the toilet seat up, son? Yes, we'll have to, but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs. I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat? Well, speak of the devil. Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea. Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork.  What's the matter, Butters? Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham. I'll get it.  Your friends wanted to see you, Butters. Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night. All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it. And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to "Oh, why don't we just drink each other's cum?"! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?! We'll talk about that when you're older.  What? Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend. How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who ''clearly'' has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything! Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: ''I'' had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with ''me'' now. I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell. Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you. You should have never come to our town!  What?! How? Son of a bitch, it's him all right! He's stopping at another house.  Yes, we found that in his pocket.  Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?! Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?! Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua. Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault. It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids. You probably think Butters seems somehow... different. It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place. Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing. It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do! You know that's not allowed! Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa. No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.  Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called "hapahui apahoha", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard.  Butters, what happened to your eye? Here we go.  And your favorite lemon bars.  How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer? Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!  Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking? I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young! Then we can go with him. Yeah, yes. That's right.  Putting the toilet seat down isn't that hard. So is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl? My God, people. This is a funeral! Please have some respect! There's a little boy here who has lost his mother!  Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob. Oh, hello, Ugly Bob.  Because you're goddamn ugly...  Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip. How come you guys say stuff like that? Hello ma'am, we're the Toilet Safety Administration. Oh yeah, we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am. You need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches, but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt. The what? Oh sure.  It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty. Oh. Safety belt?  Everything okay, sweetie? Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this. Ohhh...  Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?  Oh my goodness, what's going on? Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?  Oh well, no TV for him for a few days. After the recent tragedy, new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security. Can we come in? Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in. This is for your safety. A woman died, you know. Uh-uh, go on. You can always sue somebody. You got it.  Sir Thomas Harrington. In England, died in 1692. Why not? You can always sue somebody. It's just gonna take some special protocol. We would have to perform a sue-ance.  You bet. Here at Hoffman and Turk we specialize in suing the dead. If you hire us, we'll work hard, for you. Now look. I'll be asking all of you to have a very open mind and a willingness to face you fears.  I warn you boys. A sue-ance can be very... expensive. How much do you have? Wow! That's exactly how much a sue-ance costs.  Alright boys, sit down and clear your minds. The sue-ance is about to begin. Doors and windows are locked. You boys have your $500 in cash ready? Alright. Then I've got this big bowl set here to catch all money we're about to make. Now. Let us start.  We call out to the land of the dead. Sir John Harrington. Your presence is requested. Appear to us, John Harrington. We have a subpoena. John Harrington. My client is due compensation for negligence.  What is your name, spirit?  We have a claim against a John Harrington. Do you know him, spirit? We gotta grease him. Put a hundred in the box.  Yes, that's him. Is his personage amongst you? Give him another hundred.  By the power of Christ, we sue you!  By the power of Christ, we sue you! Quick, put the other $300 in the box!  This actually went really, really well. Always happens some bureaucrat tries to block the first sue-ance attempt, but this was good. We'll get him tomorrow. Yeah, we're gonna need about 400 more dollars tomorrow. I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde, but don't worry. We're going to win this thing. Oh, oohh! The spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena. Motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff? Ah, aaaah! Our motion has been denied by the judge.  This specter is like none I have ever encountered. I managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim. We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each. Hang in there, Clyde. This is all to make the world a safer place. Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions. You will be sued, spirit. Thy liability is without question.  Appear before this court, Harrington. Quick, everyone, get our all your money.  Fuck me, it's a ghost. A...a...a...a sue-ance? Wow, that's weird. Jeez, it's not working. What's happening now? Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh!  I-I don't see a b-b-Bat-Mobile. Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style.   This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar? Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff. He said "at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red" Ruh Rehh... Red Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken. Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue. Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer. Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh... Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket! I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick.  Yeah thanks.  Asshole. No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work.   So ridiculous.  Thanks.  Aw, you people have me on camera now? Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights? Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA.  What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet? We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity. Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves. It is time for us all to grow up. It is time for a sue-ance. Well, yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off. Oh, that's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops. Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.  Just trying to leave without being rude.  Grandpa, how much did you spend on that? Six thousand?! Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ''our'' money! BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM! That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow. All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.  Huh?  Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?! Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?  Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?! Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric!  Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug! Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!  Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team! Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool.  Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it. How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about! Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is! Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!   Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks! Yeah, no, ''you'' nice going!  Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt!  Oh yeah, good one!   Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs! YEAH!  YEAH! WOO! Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared.  Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it! ...Yeah...  All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow. That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better. That's IT!  Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show. Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this. Thanks Jim.  Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal? Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now! Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic! Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.  Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better. So that's it.  No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse. My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety! Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much!  STAN?! Stan!   Get in the car, Stan! We're going home! Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  God damn it! Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do! Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous! I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity. ... Come on, everybody, let's work on that kick off change and get back to some football.   Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it? Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives? No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.   Oh, is that so?  Sure um... Chad, is it? Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day? Yeah I'll bet.  Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you. Yeah, w-what are they?  You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what? Yeah, sure, 'cause...  Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Ooohhh shit. How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?  You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?  You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive. Oh no, pull in here. Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun!    Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark. Huh? Nothing. Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean? And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.  We scared him! We thought that'd be enough! This guy doesn't know when to quit!  Hello? Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.  Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is. Yours? What? It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.  It's finally happened, Sharon!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.  And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now. I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video!  Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it? You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition. Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan? Well? There she is.  Shelly come on! Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Well, what do you think? Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it. You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS. How many uh, how many copies of ''Meet The Fockers'' do we have in stock, Shelly? Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly. Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?  People just don't know we're open yet!  Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something? Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong! Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place! I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone! Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!  Hey, whoa, what are you doing? Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night! Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here! . This is the night we turn it all around. Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be ''swamped'' with people trying to rent DVDs! Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!   Sooner or later! They'll have to come!  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie! I'll take a DVD of ''Robocop 2'' and the director's cut of ''Blade Runner''. No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak. He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother. No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!   Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little ''talk'', Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  What are you doing, Shelly? Okay.  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'! Who are you people?! You aren't real! Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  Run! You'd better run! Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr! Haarrrr!  Raaaawr!  Streaming ''Halloween 4''! Hahaha! AAAAA!  Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?! Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!   No... Yeah... Okay... Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange.  Oh I feel like such an idiot. But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today. All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair! I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now.  If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir. The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos? Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in. The law is the law sir.   You say something? Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs?  Can I help you with anything? Okay, were you with a cruise ship or land tour group? Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything. Shoes off, belts off! Sharp objects go in the plastic tray! Shut up! Sir. Shoes off. Belts off. This is inhumane. Be careful up there, Pete. The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run! Hello. They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore! Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch.  Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? ''Dancing with the Stars''? The fat transsexual? Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green. The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man? Taking a dump today, ma'am? I'll just need to check inside your aaasshole.  All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir? Alright, sir. I just need to check inside your aaasshole.  Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir? That's a big boy, sir. Yes. Put your coffee in the plastic tray please, sir. I just need to check your asshole.  Asshole clear. Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can... That's a camera. It's a security camera. No, just need to pee. Hi  Hey, how are you?  Okay, I'm done. I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man. Yeah, I'm a big boy. I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.  What's going on down here?  Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?  How about I put on the uniform? Huh? What do you think? You know you like it. UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you. If you'll just...  Yeah?  Huh?  And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark! What?  What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo!  Yes, that's mine. Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs.   Burns. Jimmy Burns. What's it to you? Who are you, mugs? No! No! Never! Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. Might need a little something to jar my memory. Oh yeah, Harrington. I know him. Always going round inventing things. Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't. Yeah, I've seen him around, alright. He was just down that way, bragging about some porcelain machine and whatever.  Nooo! Nooooo! You can't sue me!   I am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine.  Yeah yeah. Got any metal in your pockets? Pick your coffee up, sir.  It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location. Shiiiit! Yeah. Yeah. Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws.  Quick, sue him! And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon   Everyone pay attention!   Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-?  Alright, let's do it. How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.  He's back!  I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her! He casually dropped this on his way out!  Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing! No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.  Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday. Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb.  Well, you're very welcome. Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?  Oh, Gerald... Oh, hello.  Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed. Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man! Oh yes! Do it harder, UPS man! That's right, Kyle.  Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business! No, we won't. We need your expertise, sir. We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand...  Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us. Sorry? Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought-  I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place.  Gaaah! Yeah, you will. How about we agree to that, if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate. What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine? But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him. Go back to the 90s! Faggooots! Zipliiine! When did we devolve into watching fat kids sketti wrestling? Security breeeach! An embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration. Shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through TSA security with a gun and a baby. Leaving the toilet seat up. The head TSA chief of operations had this to say: Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy. First, there was planking.  But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it? Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say "Oh Long Johnson" on video before getting out of the way. This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety. The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death. Household cats have evolved into a species as intelligent as humans. Will this mean war between our two life forms? In an attempt to try and communicate with the leader of cats, experts have sent in the ambassador of people. And the toilet seat was up. Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor Sir John Harrington. Now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead, lawyers are gonna try and sue him. Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival.  Guess we'll find out on Sunday. ''There he is, Sir John Harrington.'' You can't sue me.  So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink. Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look down right at your Harrington to flush?! That's gross! Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole?  What?! Randy! Go ahead and open it, Stan.  It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo! Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner? Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic? I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain. Do you mean that? How do we fix this, doctor? We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore. Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home! Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?  Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?  Ooooo, stuff from Amazon? You know, to be honest, I can't remember?  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?   Oho, Randy, it's beautiful! Randy, are you being serious?  I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money. I didn't say anything. Ya think?  I think that's good. Feel tight enough? Let's see the shield.  Yehay! Stan's about to go out with his friends. For what?! Randy, let him go trick-or-treating. Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  Can I help you with something?  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.  I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower? You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen? You want me to bring you some McDonald's? What do you want from McDonald's? . That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds. Six thousand dollars. It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so. Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?  Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all. Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy...  Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?  Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend. Oh, for me?  Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing? I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck. That's a good idea.  You didn't steal this, did you?  It's 14-karat gold, diamond and turquoise. I'll give you fifteen dollars. Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit. These are real diamonds, right? Okay. Eight dollars.  Nine dollars. Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos? Fourteen-karat gold gets yaaa $14 a gram on the open market, got about... 4 grams here...  It's not really worth my time. I guess I can give you a six-layer burrito for it. Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going! Okay, folks, we are com-, half-way complete with today's broadcast.  $320!That's a steal. Now th-oh, there go the phones, they're lightin' up. I believe we have a sale? Do we have a sale? Yea- let's get her on the line. Hello? Who am I speakin' with? Vivian, you just got a heck of a deal. What's your last name, sweetheart? You can't remember. Well can you remember your credit card number? Hold on, Vivian, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay- Oh my gosh, can you believe this?

This is-oh! We got a caller already on this one! Hello sir, you must be a fan of panzoto-panzanite. ...What's that? Okay, we're gonna sell this ring for just thirty-seven ninety five.  Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad. Yes you would. Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?   Well, you think it's funny, but that's, that's callin' up and tellin' someone to kill themselves; that's not a joke. Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello? Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself. Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry ? Yes. Hello, sir? Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it. Yes ma'am! Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?! Hello... my name is... Vivian. Oh I... I can't remember. 3 7 1 5- (Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!) (Fuck yeah!) (Totally!) (Yeah, dude!)  (I don't know. That seems quite pointless.) (Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!) (Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)  (I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?) (This is Tango. I have the goods.) (Me, too.)  (What?!)  (This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!) (Dude, it's just a fever blister!) (I can't take it!)  I don't know. I really don't give a shit. Beavers!  Hey.  Fuck you, Cartman.

Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places. We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually "Mayii nahii chahatapahnii" "Whoever denied it,  Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is "Whever smelt it dealt it"  You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from! What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean? That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.   You so clehhvahh. Okay, what emero do you rike? Ohhhh you make so good chooice! Oh it's beauuutiful!  Oh, that's best one! You so clevohh!  You got good eye,  You so clehhvahh. I getting taken advantaaage!

And you come heuh an' fuck me! Nono, you fucked me!  What are you waiting for? Kill yourself. He was right. Do it. You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls. New, you're scared. You got, you got lady balls.  Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings? They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself? Put it against your temple and pull the trigger.  I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way. W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago... I have five sons, five daughters in law, sixteen grand kids, and they're the joy of my life. I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody. If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect- It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong- What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama. We faced something much much greater after World War II.  We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs- We might have a problem. We just got word somebody might try to ''Faith Hill'' this event. What's that? Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch!  It's been confirmed, Mike. My God, we might have won this thing.  Hey, somebody is under the stage. We got it. We got it! I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire!  Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of Bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.  Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe.  That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up. Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and Hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point? Good. Now put the gun in your mouth. Hey! You're following plankers and Tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT!  I will be right back.  Yes, what is this about?  Another species? What are you talking about? They're evolving. Cats are evolving.  There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.   What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire?  Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want? You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get! For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called Tebowing'' [The caption ''TEBOWING'' appears in the middle of the screen]''.  This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous Tebowing can be. These youths paid with their lives for Tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs  get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember-- Here is a good place. I'll do it right here. Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second. How could I get hurt?  A traaain! AAAAAA!  No, no! Nooo! AAAA!!!No, no, no, no, noooo! Learn from me. I don't know, Ryan. You sure this is a good idea?  Okay, hold still.  What's that? RYAN! AAAA!!! AAAA!!! RYAN! This sure is a nice car, Tommy.  Would you like to get a picture of me Tebowing in it? Oh my God! It's coming!  Tommy, d-did you get the picture? Hurry, hurry! AAAAA!  Aaah! Hi there. Then a little boy called me a skank.  Ohhh, cute!  The incredible Harvey Fierstein? Sure.  What is that? God, no!  Aahh! No, no! Oh no, wait! Hold on!  AAAAA!   <poem><i>Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)</i></poem> But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and-   Hey, did you see today's newspaper? You guys made the front page. Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday. Jewpa what? Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts? So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up. Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass. Yeah. Boooo! Oh, we have a new cheerleader? Where? Hey yeah. Hey Tolkien. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth. Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet. It just looked like you cut it off, that's all. We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too.  Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me. He ate it! Ohhhh.  Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.  Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way. He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff. If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home.  Wow, what's this? Hey, what are you doing?  Knock it off! Yes, sir. Professor Lamont, we need to talk. You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont. Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet? We're having a hard time following you here. You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?  Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?! Sorry we made you wait, everybody.  I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again?   I'd like to know about the biology of the trees. Yes.  Skip a free lunch? Not me!  Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right.  Ohh wow, it's the Avengers! Oho, and Honey Boo Boo!  Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume! All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me!  You ready, you ready?   I'm recording, go. Larry! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Jeeea- Oh oh oh. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh- Oh Don Piano. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Jon-Jon-Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.  Oh Long Johnson.  Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Piaano. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Lalalonde. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. What are those boys doing, daddy? How droll.  Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.  Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school. Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black. Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person. Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine.  Uh hum. Mmm.  I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage. You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain. Oh, really? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball?  That's fascinating. Please, go on. You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains. Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say "Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain." Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction. All right, but don't take too long.  Hello. Meow, meow. Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Don Piano. Oh Don Piaaano. Oh Lala Lionde. Oh Long John- Don Piano. Don Piaaaano. I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children. Meow. Meow. Meow, meow. That's pretty cool. With the inevitable species war looming, our country's brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats. It's called putty-whistling. And the question on everyone's mind... Who will be the first person to die from it?  And so in the face of war a little boy reminds us all what being human really means. The message is unclear. But it doesn't matter as long as you give the audience a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with boobies. It's called pandering and all over the country people are-  To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington. I started working in the governor wing in 1974. I'm gonna say two things... I was wrong when I figured it out. You were wrong when you didn't. Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good? Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt?  Nuh-uh!  Why?! Why are you happy for me?! Nothing!   No!  No!  AAA! Where is everybody? What's goin' on?? Hey! In here!  Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on.  Oh... Good. It sure was. Yeah. Now that it's over, I... I guess it was kind of fun.  I'd like that.  Hey Nichole. Sure!  What's up? Oh. Okay... I think... you're really great. Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around.  Yeah. Yeah, I guess.  Yeah. Yeah, we're through.  Hi. I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black.  There are still people who will look at us funny. And think we're supposed to be together. I don't care, either.  YAY!  Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness. Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.  At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything. Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air. He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I.   Come in. I helped you make a documentary, Kyle. Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I? But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  Not by us, or anyone else.  It actually aired last night. Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo. Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't- That's good, Fatty, get pissed! Yeah, Fatty! What the hell is going on? We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story! That wasn't a dog? Mr. Billings? What?  There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?  We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs. So where are we heading first? The Bahamas? Where to now? All the kids will be so disappointed. Alright, grab him. Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice. Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety. Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company.  There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number...  I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%. Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right.  It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch. So it's a baby Squatch? Jewpacabra? No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it...  That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it. That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell. I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave. If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you.  I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo! Good shot, Bobo! I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet. Alright! Come on, let's go! It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo? It's not big enough to be a Squatch. That's what I'm thinking. But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left. But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra! We've never seen this before! It really is true! 'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that. What'dya think, Bobo? Now what do we do? Good idea.  Wait wait wait wait. We're gonna need to take the evidence. Bobo thinks scary! Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary! Whoa, look at this! I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video! It's all orangie!  That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals! No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man! Bobo shoot it!   Bobo got it! Bobo got the bunnymaaan! Alright.  I got the evidence right here. The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with. You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you.  Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay?  It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.  It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA? Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them. Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children. And I love you son. And our love grows. Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG! What's happening to us?  Mom! Don't let God kill me!  Good for you, Stan, nice somebody in this school has some balls. Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls. Butters? Your grandma's looking for you. She said to meet her outside behind the school. Good for you, Stan.  You made us look like uncaring idiots! So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us. About Tolkien? Why? Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea. That boy Tolkien.  Well, so then your cousin Albert, Linda, actually has two girls now. One is three and the other's about little Butters' age, I think. Well sure, you come and sit right here next to Grammy. Oh some tea would be lovely.  tough, huh? Think you're fuckin' tough, huh?  You don't look fuckin' tough. No, you're a little faggot!  You got any more money? Huh?  Do somethin', you little bitch! You're Grandma's bitch!  Oh, there's the tea. Tea for me. How lucky. Goodness, what a treat this is.  You went and narc'd on me!  I heard somebody brought in an anti-bully counselor! Thought I wouldn't find out, you little narc?!  Put it in your mouth! Put it in your fuckin' mouth!  Ohhh hellow. I'm sorry, Uh I needed the restroom and my grandson brought me to this one. Isn't that right, Butters? Oh thank you so much.  You narc again and you're fuckin' dead! Fuckin' dead, you got it?! Oop, uh coming.  Oh heavens to Betsy, Linda. This is such a yummy yummy ham. I just love your cooking.   Linda, is that a new clock on the wall? Oh, an anti-bullying video? How adorable.  Oh, look, it's Captain Pussy!  You can't stop me, Captain Pussy! Don't even try! I got inspired when I came across your gay little costume in your closet.  Now come on, Captain Pussy! Time for you to get your Gummi bears! Come 'ere!  Then it looks like you get... Gummi bears!  Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers ™ are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying? Aha, well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse. He didn't want that disclosed. We would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon. You believe positive thinking is really what's critical in schools right now? What's wrong with you?! No, shut up! What kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign?! Bullying needs to be stopped! Now! This afternoon! Wuhhh duhhh. You may only have an Internet degree, but why don't you start acting like you're a school counselor and not an uninformed backwards little dork! M'kay?!  What makes a bully?  Are you bullied in the school, Lorraine? Kids pick on you, call you names? What kind of things do they say to you? Do they say "Nice pants. Why do you wear them up to your tits?"?  Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?! Whassup?!  You went and made a video and sold it without lettin' me know. Doin' a video was my idea! It's the property of Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™, you got that?!  Oh, it's been stwessful?!  Oh what? You gonna cwy? No, go ahead, cwy. Let me see ya.  Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay? Uh who said? Oh, he's a little Anonymous Andy? Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking. Wull I mean it kind of wo-uhuh works out. Wah-eh jus- will we he-?  The assembly is mandatory. M'kay? You'd better show up. 'Kay? Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?! Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay? Huh. You, you, think the students would like that? Mmkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team? Hey, get off the field! M'kay?!  Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay? Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay.   Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do? Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you?  Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay? Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me. Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it.  Hey Butters. Stand ground. Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay?  Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter.  Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to- Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay. ''[sees another group of kids and goes towards it] Uh hey kids. Kids over here...'' Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?!  It's worthless now! Free Pussy Riot! Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked. Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am. This way. Bras? ...d'Yes. ...Sometimes. ...Ugly ...neh-nerd.  No... He's cool. <poem><i>Stupid! (stupid stupid)</i></poem> <poem><i>Dork!</i></poem> Grandma? but how di- No! Grandma please, nnnot Gummi bears! Ahh! Grandma!  I can't. Awww! Eewww! Stand up for yourself! Fight back! Be a fucking man!  Oh what? Stan Marsh got you to come talk to me?! That little cliché conflict resolution Kevin! It was my idea. I told the students to make the video and I-and I produced the entire thing! I deserve to have my name on it! But... but this was gonna be the thing that finally made Bully Buckers ™ a national organization.  The video was conceived, written, and directed by the South Park student body, you got that?! Yeah, only problem is America doesn't give a SHIT about an old fart with a Captain Kangaroo haircut! They wanna believe kids did something on their own.  Here's a cease and desist letter from our lawyers. If you ever claim any authorship of the video again, we will sue you for everything you have! Oh, you gonna cwy?! Oh don't cwy, you'll wook bad wif your wittle Captain Kangawoo haircut!  We all know that bullying has become an epidemic. Like AIDS, bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises. But now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself.  I'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film. Stan, congratulations on all your success. And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there? Come on, this is for everyone who's been a victim. What do you wanna say to bullies all across America? Go ahead.  Right now. Say it. Do you hear that, bullies? Stop making kids say things on your TV shows!  What else do you wanna say, Butters? Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters? Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?! Come on, this is for America!  What the hell were you thinking?! Everyone just saw that the bully victim in your movie is actually a violent psychopath! This could kill our box office. People are gonna come after us now, saying we didn't check our facts! It's your fuckin' movie! Now I'm gonna have to work overtime with marketing to make sure people still sympathize with our victim! Jesus, just get the fuck out of here! I've gotta go to the bathroom!  Uh oh. Uh...  My child,  have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad. Oh, what are you gonna do? cwy now? Shhhh. My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use... That's what I'm doing.  Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son. Yeah, I know how it goes. I ''know''. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud. NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son? Pff, I know, right? Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here.  P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos? Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again! We need to get some bracelets. I'm confused. These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can. You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out.  You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarus need my help. Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now.  I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarus busting my ass! What are you on?! What?  Aw, shit! Yeah... Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us. What can we possibly do? Vengeance is mine!  Get out!  Thank you my children.   Boooo!   Hey that guy's jackin' it! Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out.  The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape. For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of "I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining". It's the last day of Spring break,  For ten year old Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the last day has come too soon. Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo.  It's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter.  The boys have just made a sobering discovery.  But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour. Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, "Dude, fuck you!" The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse. It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear.   It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle. But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing.  After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens. The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun.  Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group. The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape. But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea.  Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb. Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour.  An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining" Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape. For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat"  After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining. If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die.  Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  Kenny McCormick has died of boredom. But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered.  After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter.   he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math. 1 1 1 1 Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?

Alright buys, we're here!  Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology? We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes. Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri- Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work. .

So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning. Well I certainly would!  1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1  Why?! Tolkien likes Nichole? Okay. Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.  Who? Whowhowhowho? Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.  One two three four, sorry Bebe. She likes... movies, cats. Well- Hey Kyle,  we were gonna head over to the mall. You wanna go with us?  I don't think so. I heard Kyle swings for the same team. Ohhh. Oh my gosh, who? Oh jeez, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute. That kid, with the orange coat and the green hat? Yeah. Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush.  Yeah.   Oh no, who told you that? Ohhh. Wow, I-I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.  Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here. Oh, he does?  Okay.  Hello?? OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry! Coach wanted me to...  You think the janitors are still here? Look!  And board games. And massage oil. Well that was sure an interesting night. Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been really scary. Yeah, it kind of was. Maybe... I-I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow. Cool. Well... thanks again.  His name is Tolkien. He's really nice. So? It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence. Oh no...  Hey Tolkien. Can I talk to you for a sec? Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out. I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know? I think you're really great... W-w-we just... ...I'm sorry. Okay.  Where are you going? He did that? Oh no. Tolkien. Hey. Tolkien, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black. Maybe we can give it another try? Let them look. I don't care. I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter. Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while.  Oh, you mean Kyle?  Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams. Ooooh, Kyle. K-I-S-S-O-M-G! We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows!  Yeah?  She likes basketball. Guess he has a crush on Nichole. Really?!  We did it, Eric. We found them each other's ray of sunshine. Teeheeheehee.   Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric? Teeheeheehee, teehee.  Teeheeheeheeheehee. They're fudgey charms of sunshine. Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee.  Teeheehee, no!   Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine. No, you don't. No, you don't.  Teehee, stop it. Teeheehee, teeheeheehee,  teeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee. Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place. That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you! There she is!  Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you!  Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person. And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey. Hello?  No, a white shoe salesman tried to murder my son. I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, "Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!" Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it. I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game. Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy. We'll be back with more of the Jeffersons right after this. Welcome to today's matchup between the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Clippers.  Nuggets fans, please direct your attention to center court and the president of Halitosis Kidz.  We're all set for the tipoff.  Welcome to the inaugural game of the National Sarcastaball League! As we bring you today's matchup between the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders. And now, here are your Denver Whoop de fucking do girls! And now, here to sing the sarcastaball anthem, recording artist, Cee-Lo! The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos. We welcome you to the First Lady's Symposium on Obesity, with your keynote speaker, Michelle Obama.  Erectile dysfunction is a fact of life. You want to show her you love her, but you're old, and so is she.  This is breaking news! It's the Charlie Rose show. Here's Chuck. This is breaking news.  'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going! Yeah! Tip assist! Come on honey!  Hold on!  Hold on! I love you! I love you! Of course I'm sure! Aaahahahaaaa. Haaagh!  Haahahaagh! Tickets please. Awwwww.  <poem><i>I swear, Kyle.</i></poem> What?  Do you think we could... Do you still want to...   Oh! Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up.  Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license. Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that? Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors  Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something. And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in.  Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety! They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge.   Yeah, Jackson took a real shot and...  well I'm not sure what he's doing now, but uh, it appears as if he's looking for his keys, Dan. Coach Martin is coming over to tell him that now, but Jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home.  Somebody should let him know. Oh, and Old Surehand Mike Tafthill , who seems to be baking an imaginary cake, Dan. Well, there certainly are interesting statistics coming out, Dan, and we are deeply concerned, anduh and waiting to see if there's... really any ''direct'' correlation between football and head trauma. As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh.  Congratulations, Marsh. Good job! Nice going!  Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?  How's it going, coach? So you're happy with these changes?  I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse. Eh-excuse me? Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand. Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says "No," and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds. Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington. More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping. The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device.  An insurrection in the Hawaiian Islands has escalated to war! After sinking a cruise ship, the natives of Kauai continue to go berserk, forcing all tourists off their island.  Hm. The people have spoken, and the President of the United States is once again, Barack Obama. Yeah. Hey guys, how about a nice fucking picture to welcome in the future of sports?  Give them hell, coach! Lovin', not shovin'! Woo! Woo! Go Broncos! Go! Go Broncos, Go. Whoop de fuckin' do! Woo! Nice job, Cee-Lo! Good to see you on TV some more! Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your hit songs! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Butters, rah, Butters! I love you, Butters! Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal! Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner. Coach Belichick says,  "No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day." D'awwwww! Practice on Monday after a victory? Great! Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do! Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling.  Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show. Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go. Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times.  Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times. Jim Rome here. Hey, I love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's so thrilling I need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game. That's when I reach for a bottle of this.  Get with it, and get the Goo! Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but "So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you." Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days. Awwwwww!  Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size! When I get hot and tired, only one thing can boost my compassion.  ''Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!''  Best served just above room temperature. Excuse me.   Are those Candy Corn Oreos? Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window.  Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh... I don't have legs.  Weak! Weak! My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches.  I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!  I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!

Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew.  Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog. Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl! We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart.  Honey BOO BOO! What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart? Who waunts sketti and butter?  She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!  I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done?? This is it! Throttle down! I have to do this! I have to try and raise it! Then how do ''you'' explain all the fat people on mobility scooters?  UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on. Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there? Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low. You guys seeing this?! This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five. S. S. Cameron? This is James Cameron. I am now at... 16,000 feet. You should see the cold darkness of it all. The isolation and yet awwwe of the sea's magnitude. I have now sunk deeper than any human has ever been before!  What the fuck?! You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here! Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell!  S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar!  The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch! We're done here! Set course for the set of ''Avatar 2''   Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie? The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron. Yes, James, we hear the song. Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron. ''James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea'' ''With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.'' This one here?  You want this one?? This one?  this one right here?? Ya waunt this one?? We will not move aside! We will stand our ground!  We are here in the ocean depths goin' deep deep deep-  Oh hey James Cameron. <poem><i>I've been divin' in the deep and I'm feelin' so cheap.</i></poem> I don't want anyone raisin' the bar, 'cause nobody'll hire me! ''Deep deep deep in the ocean.'' Ohhh, come on. Fight me, Cameron. Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention.  Let's do this!  Something's wrong. This... This is all wrong!  Stop! Everyone! What are we doing?! How can you let this happen to your daughter?! We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity!  You think he's dead?  I hope so. Well I'll be damned.  Ms. Obama, are you, uh, ma'am? Are you okay? Hey Cameron, we can't believe it. Mr. Cameron.  People should know. How you saved us all? How you raised the bar? How will they know what a hero you are?  Yes! Yes! I saw them, Kyle, I saw them! If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me! A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man.  Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again. Wouldn't be the first time.  There's no getting rid of him. Not in any you folks would be prepared for. Noh, best you just let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he'll get tired of it. We used a pretty blonde to lure him in. When she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub. She took off her clothes and... asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk. The milkman said, "You want that milk pasteurize?" And the blonde replied, "No, just up to my boobs. I can splash it in my eyes." That's when we jumped 'im. It was over in minutes. Then we burned his body. You wanna get rid of the milkman? You gotta kill him and kill him good. And then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on. Didn't kill 'im, did ya?  Yea', I didn't think you had it in ya. Milkman don't get scared. Not with free pussy at every doorstep. Yea'. Got yourselves some nice home security systems, don'tcha? Payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house. Only problem is, while you're out feelin' like your things are safe, that security man is fucking your wife. And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all. Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days. Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows. We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth? Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe out''side'' the home. Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back.  Ah! Who are you?? Hoo!  Hey there, looks like I got a couple of packagers from Amazon for ya. If I can just get your signature right  there? Thad. Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone.  Well, have a good one. Hey there, misterrr Stotch. looks like another Amazon package.   ...Sss-sorry? What are you-?  Look, you can have whatever's in the back! Ih-ihit's all stuff from Amazon! Just let me go, huh? Aaawwgh!   Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya? What? What's going on? Don't you think I want to?!  Hello? No! They blew up my car! They blew up my car!  They're after me again! Do something!  Somebody answer me! You have to send help now!  Hello?!  This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right? That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me? Okay, I've got something a little different here. No problem. It's all right, it happens all the time. You want to rape your mom? You said you lived there. Hey, ey uh,  you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid! Well hello there, Mr. UPS man! Oh my God. Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on! No! I love you! I love you back!   Hello, this is Varashnu wit Wolf Home Security. ...Uh yes, I am in United States. Okay, hold on.  This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right? We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones. Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood. I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head. All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet!  Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can.  So you say this man killed himself because he was a psychopath who was forced to have sex with his mother?  Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes. Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed? What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year! How many people at the Monster Mash? You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves? All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise. FIRE!  We got the sonofabitch! Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay.  A security system that is actually inside you. It's called IN-security. Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with...  INsecurity.  We'll never forget the day we took our twin daughters to the beach. A white man just tried to murder our twin girls. I only hope other have people have INsecurity to protect their families. Hehey, what cute twins. They're so adorable  Thanks. Would you mind getting me some water, darling? But my throat is parched, dear, and I'm so scared of burglars. Tap is fine, dear.  What was that? I could have sworn I saw something outside.  No, just change to channel 10, thanks. What was that?! I think somebody's here! Please I'm terrified. Please go check it out.  This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right? I have a police car on their way with blankets and cocoa.  Well, how's the shoe fit, pal? Well okayhehe, let's see if it fits better than this KNIFE THROUGH YOUR FUCKING SKULL, BASTARD!  I think it fits pretty good. Aaahh!  Go get it, Fillmore!  What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee? This is David with INsecurity. Is everything all right? Hold tight. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.  This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right? All right, could I just get your password please? I love boobs? How did you know that? Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny. Sure, here you go.  Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad. This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right? This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right? I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa. Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right? Sir, we are sending help. Just stay calm.  Hang on sir, this is Martin with INsecurity. Hello, this is Martin with INsecu- This is Mike with INsecurity. Is everything all right? You are absolutely sure about this?  Hello? I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated. Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go. Butters Stotch? Welcome home, young keiki. Your parents said you would be coming for your ceremony.  Ah- uh, who's this? Very well, we shall speak with the chief of our island and see. Come now.   Let us eat. You must stay away from this place. It is kapu.  Listen everyone! I have terrible, horrible news! I've just come from the front office! The Mahalo Rewards card is...  The Mahalo Rewards card is being eliminated! They're trying to say our points are... are... no longer going to be accepted. This isn't right! He's not a native! He's gonna get killed! Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies.  Yes. My wife Patty and I have been coming to Kaua'i for almost five years, and Bill and Donna actually own a time share in Poipu. Oh yea, let us eat.  Aloha, five order of saimin, please. Oh, I get 20% off, I'm a native. Here's my Mahalo Rewards card.  They say the spirit of the king is still in there. Uh that there is Bubba's Burgers.  Protector and Chief, I present to you the keiki, Butters Stotch. Yes, but Poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists, I'm afraid. It's one of the foods of our people. To what? What does this mean? Kapu. that means "taboo",  Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole? In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa.  Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away. O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you- Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa? What?! What has happened? Speak!  I knew one day it would come to this. The haoles are trying to do away with us. I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island!    Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome! It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you. Are all the tourists gone from our island? Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now. 1 With no rewards program, there will be no distinction between who's a native to this island and who isn't! By the gods! Perhaps he has the heart of a native after all! Why can't you people respect our island? Why do you always want nore?! What are they doing?  All but a few who are hiding out at Duke's Restaurant. We sent Bob and Trisha Turner to smoke them out. What about him? He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him! Finish his ceremony?! We are at war, David! I have lived on this island for ten years. Ten years! Every July and part of August! And I can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide! If he wants to be one of us, then he must face the challenge! He still has yet to make the turn!   I told you a haole couldn't do it! We can't fight without chi-chis! We can't hold out here any longer! He's right, David. We can't trust any tourists. Then let him prove himself! Trial by opahika'a! He's only a child! Very well.  Quiet. He must face this challenge alone.  Did you make the turn your first try? Did any of us?  We have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war, all the native Hawaiian tribes must join as one! Look, if we are to fight the haoles, we have to allow all natives to stay! Oh no? Come up here, keiki. Come on.  Let us make a pact with more chi-chis! ...Oh my God.  Arm the bocce balls!  Keep fighting! Stand your ground! You can and you MUST! Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government. Young keiki, try to control your anger. We are not surrendering today! Go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end!  And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys.  It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest? Hohhh! Awwwww.  Yeah, it's true, uh huh.   We're not joining the people of the Hyatt Grand Vacations! They have no rights to call themselves natives! Yeah! Oh and you do?! Your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago! Our ancestors sailed here! On a cruise ship! Nine months ago! Screw them! It doesn't matter how many tribes we have, we can't win! We are but a few against the haole's military might! We may have passion, but passion does not win wars!  Um, we're... we're out of chi-chis. Oh, right, we've closed off all the ports. But they're still letting vodka through, right? Uh... they can't cut off our chi-chis. This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!  God damn it. You people just don't give up, do ya? Come on, come on.  You know what chi-chis are, right? Everyone! Look, I say!  The haole did it! 1 1 1 Ben Affleck isn't with Jennifer Lopez anymore, he's married to Jennifer Gardner.  Finally.  I don't wanna go in there. Six.  God I hate this family!  I can't find it, Somebody took it!  No way, I ain't goin' neer ''that'' place. Yeeeyou go get it.  AAAAAH!  I can't find...  Where's ''Turner & Hooch''? Aahh...   Emily, the war is over! Let's go rent a movie at Blockbuster! The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now!   The hounds, Emily! The hounds! Oh, it's getting colder out. That old creepy place. I saw someone in the window there.  I did. Thanks so much, Ben. And thanks for walking me home.  What is that?   It's okay. Try and stay calm. Yeah, you can definitely tell that winter's coming.  What's the matter? Come on, let's get out of here.  Did you have fun at the Halloween party?  Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be? Coming right up.   Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs? If I may say so, Mr. Marsh, your Blockbuster will never get any customers with those two Negative Nancys sabotaging you. You may need to do something... rather extreme.  You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh.  You must be willing to do anything. All right, the camera's out. Hurry up, you two!  God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away! All right, who were your friends? Let's try this again.   Get rid of him! Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't. What the? You told me these things were full of money! Hey, we caught one of them. We got him tied up in the back.  He's lying. They saw everything! It's Halloween. I thought everyone would be renting spooky movies.  It was the Avengers, Brad!  Sorry, kid. End of the line.  Who are you?! Get 'em! Hey, one of them dropped this.  It's an invitation to a Monster Mash at the community center.  What's the matter? Whaht is what? What is he doing way out here? The Monster Mash is only ''on'' Halloween.  You mind if we search your room? Oh my God, what have we done? Oh my God. Are those what I think they are? Most of the town, sir. It's a graveyard smash.  Sorry. I can't see a thing in here. Hey hay, I can't see! Where do I go?  Sir, we've found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town. Look, whatever we do, we'd better hurry. It gets on in a flash. What the hell is going on here?! Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that. HAAAAA!  AAAAA!  AAAAA! Wait, wasn't that Peterson in there?  Is that Morgan Freeman? Next please.  You are sure you want to do this?   Hold still please. These latest tests are once again confirming that the performance-enhancing drug HGH was in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. All over the country people are having their "What Would Jesus Do" wristbands cut off. It was just last week a team of scientists found traces of HGH on the Shroud of Turin  Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper.  The tests are done and the results are in. The little boy who claimed he never cut off his "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet did cut it off, and lied about it. Though the tests seem conclusive, Stan Marsh continues to deny any cheating. It has become the biggest concern for most people. The farmers of Belarus and their plight against their government. And now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis. His name? Jesus. Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high. If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh. Please let us check your wristband for superglue. Are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet, Mr. Marsh? Then, let us ah-see it. I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige. All right, it was Craig.  Not only did we find traces of ah-superglue, but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well. This is a dark ah-day for honest French-Swedish people everywheure. Can't you see I'm trying to do ah-my calisthenics?  Is ah-tap water going to be okay, or do you want me to go down to Crystal Geyser and bring Her Highness some right from the spring? It's ah-your imagination  You just want me to change the channel or should I go and make a TV program written ah-just for you?! It's ah-starting to feel like ah-The Carole Burnett Show in here.   Maybe it's ah-the peepee fairy so somebody can ah-take a peepee for you too. Oh, it's ah-Tweedle Dumb and ah-Tweedle Dee trying to break in-ah-to my house! Ah-excuse me, I'm sorry to intrude, but do you want to please ah-leave or should I make you some kofel bread and ah-sausages?!  Here you go, kofel bread and some sausage for you. We are here tonight with the only person in America who still wears his "What Would Jesus Do" wristband. Please welcome Stan Marsh. Stan, after everything that's come out, after all the facts have been proven, why do you still wear the wristband? You just like it. Well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their "What Would Jesus Do" wristband is doing all of society a disservice. Chris Martin you say that Stan Marsh is... a dick? What do you say about that, Stan? All right, well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with Stan Marsh, and thinks he's doing the right thing. Please welcome a retarded fish.  What about the Crusades, Stan? Does that enter into your decision at all? Anything to add, Retarded Fish? Dick!  Yeah, yeah, thanks Charlie. My problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth! Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that's fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus's name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud! Wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone! That that's because, that's because you're a retarded fish, and you don't know any better! What about the Crusades?! The Inquisitions?! How many people were tortured to death for somebody who is a fake?!  Nnno, No, I'm good. Thank you. Move aside, farmers! This land is no longer yours! Hello Stan, Steve Nelson with Endorsement Management. Are you ready for your Nike commercial?  Would you like to be seated? Hey, you wanna siddown? Sir, the captain has asked everyone to take their seats. Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet. Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together. Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use? Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus. Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right? Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next? And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us. Is that it? Did he just? Did he just? Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel? He's being presented with the check now, a five thousand dollar gift certificate to P.F. Chang's.  This has been a long campaign, but someone's finally done it, Wolf. Yeah! Yeah! ...to discredit him too. Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service? Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be? Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs. One at a time, please. One at a time. Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more! Absolutely! Five dollars please. Oh my, it's the sound! Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound.  My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo! No please! Please show mercy! AAAAH!!  Okay, Mr. Thompson, voting line is right over there.  Oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy? Security? This little boy lost his mom.  Heaah? It's all right, come on.  Oh dear. Did you lose your mommy, little boy?  Would you like some warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts? Would you like warm nuts, sir?  I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever.  Yes?  Yes, hello General. Very pleased. Thank you for your help. You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours.   I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation. Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken. Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private? All right. Where are the ballots?  General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not? Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?! I told you China would get the rights to ''Star Wars'' from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure!  it is not secure! Mr. President? Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso. Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised. And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this? We assume you are preased with the erection results? And you no doubt will now begin filling your side of the bargain.  Little boy, the President is on his way to pick up the ballots. Where are they?! Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want! Sssure, we have the ballots, but we don't have them right here with us now.  Mr. President, we got you reelected! Now you ''will'' give us the Star Wars technology so that we can make the sequels! Morgan Freeman? That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you! Get out of our way!  You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made! Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud? Let's just see.  Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry.  Well kid? Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out.  More melted butter, sir? Oh my God, it's the President!  Oh, of course. Come on, let's let the President have some peace and quiet.  Wow, the President eats at Red Lobster. He's just a normal guy like me. Come on guys. President says "get out."  I didn't actually vote for him.   You see, when the United States created ''Star Wars'' it made this country incredibly powerful.  Earlier this week, Lucas signed the rights to ''Star Wars'' over to Disney, and the Chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves. The Chinese government knew that President Obama would help them take the rights from Disney if they helped him get reelected. But the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them, and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met. You've all got quite a mess on your hands. I wish you well with it.  Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle.   You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted ''Star Wars'' is because they're afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard ''Star Wars'' impeccable legacy. And now we're at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep ''Star Wars'' from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, "What's more important? That the right man is elected President, or that ''Star Wars'' is with people who will protect it most?"  Just what the Dickens is going on here, haha?! What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha. Go on! Leave us alone! Haha.  Now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. Every vote counts. And you need- Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.  Pretty neat, huh? How would you like to have one?  Like what?!  Well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? If you wanna be in the next Star Wars, I'm your guy! Haha. You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle. Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha. Haha. Hey guys. Lookin' to buy a Hummer today?  Rockvember sales event, guys! Every Hummer comes with a free Segway. I'm just excited about all these deals, that's all.   Hey why don't you shut up?! We found him sir, but still no sign of the missing ballots. This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen! Yup. Chris, we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time. Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time.    Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies! Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys! Oh my God it's a sales rush!   Unit 4, what is it?! Over. Come in Unit 4! What have you found?! <poem><i>Obama is President again. </i></poem>
