Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life. Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!  Goddammit! Who's my father? You've got to be kidding me! Eeeehh..! Is he awake yet? They can't. Mephesto can't die. No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it. Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done. No! Don't! Eh-- Yeah, stop being a wuss! Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is. Wake up, you son of a bitch! I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do? What? <poem><i>...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...</i></poem> <poem><i>...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on...</i></poem> What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him? Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay? Sweet. Hey, who's screwing with the lights?  That is really starting to piss me off. Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me. What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is? Go, Kenny! Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop. Just tell us already!  Dammit! Tell me who my father is already! Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak. Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?! No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my ''mom?!'' Ooohhh, forget it!
