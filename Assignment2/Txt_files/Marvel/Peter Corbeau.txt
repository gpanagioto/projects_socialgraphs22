==Fictional character biography==
Peter Corbeau was a college roommate of [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] and the creator of [[Starcore]]. When the army manages to capture Hulk with tranquilizer bombs, they bring him to Dr. Peter Corbeau. Peter Corbeau uses a device that manipulates the sun's rays which neutralizes the gamma energy enough to regress Hulk back to Bruce Banner.

Hulk managed to thwart the danger.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #148</ref>

Peter Corbeau later calls Colonel Jack Armbruster upon learning that he had captured Hulk and states that he has found a solution that would end Hulk. Hulk awakens upon Peter Corbeau's arrival as Peter Corbeau works with some scientists on a device that would banish Hulk into a time-space warp. It works, but it ends up freeing [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] from his mystical exile. When Peter Corbeau tries to use the machine to send Juggernaut back, it malfunctions and Hulk returns where they end up fighting through the base until the [[X-Men]] arrive.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #172</ref>

As an old friend of [[Professor X]], Peter Corbeau rescues Professor X and some of the X-Men from the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] during Christmas as Professor X mentions to him about the strange nightmares that he has been having.

Under the cover of examining an approaching solar storm, Peter Corbeau uses his connections with NASA to launch a Starcore shuttle into space in order to rescue the captive X-Men. Peter manages to pilot the shuttle into the space station.<ref>''X-Men'' #99</ref> The space station's owner [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]] informs the captive Professor X, Peter Corbeau, Cyclops, and [[Jean Grey]] that he went over the Sentinel notes and was given a funding from the Council of the Chosen to start Project: Armageddon in order to wipe out the mutant race. During Steven Lang's ranting, Cyclops frees himself from his containment and then frees the others. When the space station is about to explode, Peter Corbeau states that anyone who could pilot the crippled Starcore shuttle by a solar flare would be irradiated. Jean Grey pulls out the knowledge of flying a ship from Peter Corbeau's mind and uses her telepathy to surround the ship as it passes by a solar flare.<ref>''X-Men'' #100</ref> When the shuttle crashes into Jamaica Bay, the X-Men and Peter Corbeau swim to the surface as Jean Grey emerges as the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]].
