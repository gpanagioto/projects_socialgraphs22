''Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.'' Hey, Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took. I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato. My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake. You can see the momma bird fly in. We took all kinds of video with his drone.  You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere, and shoot video, and stuff. It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers. Are you crazy?! This is my ''dad's'' drone! My dad said it's not for spying on people. Oh, he'll know. You can hear it take off.  No, Eric. I don't wanna d- Comin', Dad!  Yes, it's me. Of course not! What?! You said nobody would know! Be careful! The powerlines! Okay, uh, maybe that's enough.   Let me see! Jeeeeezz! What do I do?!  I don't know what to do!  Oh, heh-hey, Dad.  Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask? I love you too, Dad.  What the heck are you doing?! When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?! You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble! Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing! WHY?! I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand! Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?! Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?! Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?! Why?! That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig. Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy. I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll- I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses! I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it! I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does! You do? What? NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna- ...Okay. If this doesn't work, we're dead. Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy. No! No, no! I'm sorry. Thank you, Eric! I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
