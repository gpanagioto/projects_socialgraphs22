Who's seeing dead people? Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts. Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you. Yeess. That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS. That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years. So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS. Butters, what is going on?! Well you'd better stop having nightmares or else you're gonna be grounded! Butters! What have you done?! No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him. Now do you believe us, Butters?  Butters?!
