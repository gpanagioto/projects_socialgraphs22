It's all right, Dad. All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop. Yeah I know. Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal. I don't know,  I just like it. Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off. ...I don't know.  I like it. No, I just, I don' know. No. I have? You're wearing a bracelet to think of me? You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters? ...Farmers in where? Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands? Wow, this is happening so fast.  for standing. No thanks. I'll stand. I'm good. Tell the captain to take off.  For what? No! This is stupid! No! I never cut if off! What's the big idea, Craig?! You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people! You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside! And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out! Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute! Yeah.  Thanks Kyle. Why does it matter?! You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!  Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?! You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it! Jesus! What are you doing here? Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything? Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that. It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial. Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair. Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles? NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue. Pff it's like, that's here  and... Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important! Exactly! People don't even know where it is. How can we raise awareness? Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets... Our... scause? Dude, the hell just happen? People are saying that?  Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.   It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along. We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company. Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
