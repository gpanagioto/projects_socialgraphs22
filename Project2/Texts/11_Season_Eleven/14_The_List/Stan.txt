Dude, Butters, calm down. Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account? It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one. And then Tolkien, and then me. Cartman, lay off! You're next to last. Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember? Who cares what dumb girls think, right?  Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you? Just for a minute. Over here.  Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made. The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?  So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list. Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last? Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy? NO. I have no idea what you're talking about. That didn't sparkle with her, did it? What's going on? Jesus, dude!   Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.  Kyle! Kyle, don't! The list was a forgery, Kyle! It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list.  It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up. Wendy! Wendy!  Here, Kyle.  Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle? ...Abe Lincoln? Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?
