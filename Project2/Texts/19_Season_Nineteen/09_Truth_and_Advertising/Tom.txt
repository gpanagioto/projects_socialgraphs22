Well, that's what an ad does. She was designed to entice, and manipulate. Jimmy, we're newsmen, like you. For decades we used our soft buttery voices to inform the people about what's happening. Then we watched as our entire industry was taken over by the ads.  Some of our colleagues were manipulated into doing the ads' bidding. The man who came to your house with a gun was one of them. Our own Kevin Jarvis has more. Thanks, Kevin. The only hope for the truth to get out there, Jimmy, is for you to see through this ad's deception and to find out what they're planning. Your Super School News was a threat to them. But unless you get this little bitch to talk, we may never know why. Jimmy, you're thinking with your dick. Yes you are. Put your dick away. Jim. Jimmy, that's your dick talking.  all ads lie. And all ads deceive. What the hell is that? How did an ad get in here? Let's go to David at the network hub. David, any word on the popup ad situation? Who is that reporter? Do we... know him? Thanks, Brian.  He's working for the ads, obviously. Sellout douche-bag. Thanks, Rick. Stay dry. Jimmy!  His dick is compromised.  Well then,  Officer Barbrady, we need you to shoot these kids. The ad has got to him.  There's no time to argue. Do you want to save your town?! Barbrady, shoot them in their heads! You're making the worst mistake of your life, officer. Dammit!
