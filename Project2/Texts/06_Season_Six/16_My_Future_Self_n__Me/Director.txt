Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son. Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son. Alright, so we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News. Motivation Corp. takes care of everything.  Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives. So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding. Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking. So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism.  Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means. Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!
