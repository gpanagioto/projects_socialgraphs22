Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you. They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down. I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous. Really? In People? Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something. Okay. I'll get our coats.  Toxins? You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all.  Really? Oh no! Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner. Wonderful! Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.  Okay, here he is. But you're more in touch with the earth. Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor! How are you feeling, boubbie?
