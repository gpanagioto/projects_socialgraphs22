Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam.  Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch?  My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other? In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated. At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming!  All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting.  You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death! Global warming must be over!
