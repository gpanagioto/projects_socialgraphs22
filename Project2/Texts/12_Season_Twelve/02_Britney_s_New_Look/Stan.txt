Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?   Butters, don't be such a pussy. Oh no. Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids. I told you that would work! Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not? Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else. You do? We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her. Oh, thank God. We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry. Oh no!  Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself. Yeah, of course.  Jesus Christ! Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can. Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse. What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain! No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!  She doesn't have any lips! We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.  I know where. We want three tickets to the North Pole.  We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt.  Oh no.  Dude, they're never gonna let us through. It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon.  You doing okay, Ms. Spears?  Oh no!  Kyle, what the fuck is going on now? Sacrificed? For ''what''? All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough! No wait.
