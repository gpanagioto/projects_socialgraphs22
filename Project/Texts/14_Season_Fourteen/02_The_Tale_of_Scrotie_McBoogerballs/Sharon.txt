"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"?  Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this! This book! Our son and his friends wrote it! Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good! I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid! Nono, just keep reading. I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end. Randy please! You've got to listen to me! Well? Right? It's not just me. What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean. Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
