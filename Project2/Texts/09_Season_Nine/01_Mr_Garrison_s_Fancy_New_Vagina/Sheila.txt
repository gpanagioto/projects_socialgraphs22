Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside. They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand? There. You see, Gerald? He totally understands. What?? Absolutely not, Kyle! Yes, but Kyle- Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is. The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty! Where are you going?!  Gerald! What happened to you?! A dolphin?!?!  Gerald, this is crazy!
