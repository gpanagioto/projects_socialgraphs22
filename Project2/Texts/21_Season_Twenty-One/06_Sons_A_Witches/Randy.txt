Hey Sharon, did you see the box of Jack Daniels? What do you mean? Of course I am. Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys. We have some drinks. Come on, all the other guys' wives aren't being bitchy about it. Sup, witches!  Yep. Who's got the other stuff.  Yeah, right. We're gonna miss the first night of the party. Well, I got the Jack. Oh yeah! Jack and Crack Witch Week! Let's do this! And screw the Raiders too! No way. Check out Stephen, you guys. Oooooooooooooo.  Like real, how? That's pretty cool.  Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa. Oh. Hey, didn't see you there. Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened? Are you serious?!  God, I knew that guy was a fuckin' chode!  Nothin'. We were just hangin' out and talkin' and stuff, and then Chip got all weird. Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch! All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night. What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys. Why not? Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we're supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus!  Sup guys? I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy. A witch uhhh- Yeah, that's what it is!  "Park closed until further notice". That's bullshit! They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing! Yeah, sure, no.  You go over there. Sure, Stephen.  Okay, look. You're freaked out, it's understandable. Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun. Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy.  All right, Stephen. At least give us till tomorrow morning to talk to our wives and prepare them, all right? Can you just give us till morning? It's okay. It's okay.  Hey, it's Randy. Weâ€™ve got until tomorrow morning to sacrifice Stephen to the Devil. I'll explain later, just get everyone together. And, maybe bring just a little bit of crack. Hello, Stephen. We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do! Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right? Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out. No, seriously. No we wouldn't! Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.
