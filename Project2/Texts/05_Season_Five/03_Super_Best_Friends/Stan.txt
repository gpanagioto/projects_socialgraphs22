What's going on?  How'd he do that?? No way! His a-miracles? Yeah!  Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea. No, I'm Stan. Who are you? Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here. Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home. I don't care! I'm leaving!  I'm going home. You said we're free to leave whenever we want Move out of the way. I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.  That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay. Okay, it's all clear.  We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand. Come on, Kyle, this is stupid! A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?! No, they've just ''convinced'' you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go! Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here! Oh wait, who am I again? Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me! Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend. HaaAAAA!  Hi, Jesus. It's me. This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome! I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special. Can you do it again? That's it? That's how you did that trick? That trick sucks, Jesus. Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out. But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick. Then what are we going to do. Super best friends? To where?  I am ready. Yeah. So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends? Wow. I knew it. Wow, the Moses.  Kyle! Kyle! Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!  Kyle! Kyle, you can't kill yourself! Kyle, you have to hold your breath!   You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all. Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.
