You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him. What?  All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die!  Excuse us. Excuse us. Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche! Dude, who the hell did that?  We... don't work for anybody.
