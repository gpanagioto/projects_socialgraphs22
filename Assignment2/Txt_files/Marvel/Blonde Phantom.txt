'''The Blonde Phantom''' ('''Louise Grant Mason''') is a fictional masked crime fighter appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created for Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]], she [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #11 ([[cover-date]]d Fall 1946), during the 1940s period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=33}}</ref> The heroine was so well received that the next issue was retitled ''The Blonde Phantom''. The series continued to feature her until issue #22 (March 1949).<ref name=Benton>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/78 |access-date=April 8, 2020|pages=78, 153}}</ref> She also appeared in backup stories in many other Timely comics; in ''Superhero Comics of the Golden Age'', Mike Benton observes that "for a few months in 1948, readers could find her in seven titles on the newsstand".<ref name=Benton/>

Louise Grant is a secretary at the Mark Mason Detective Agency, and secretly in love with her boss. When he is on a case, Louise takes off her glasses and lets her hair down, becoming the glamorous masked hero, rescuing him from danger in a floor-length evening gown.<ref name=Benton/> In a gender reverse to the famous [[Superman]]/[[Lois Lane]] dynamic, Mark is in love with the Blonde Phantom, and has no interest in the mousy secretary back at the office.<ref name=Madrid/>

In ''The Supergirls'', Mike Madrid writes: "Once again, a capable woman hid behind a meek persona and only let her hair down, literally, to come to the aid of a man who completely ignored her unless she assumed a disguise. In a 1947 story entitled "I Hate Myself", Louise even dreams that Mark finally confesses his love for her, only to have the Blonde Phantom persona appear and steal him away".<ref name=Madrid>{{cite book |last1=Madrid |first1=Mike |title=The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy and the History of Comic Book Heroines |date=2016 |publisher=Exterminating Angel Press |isbn=978-1-935259-33-6 |page=28}}</ref>

Louise returned in Modern Age comics as a sidekick for ''[[The Sensational She-Hulk]]'', from 1989 to 1994.

==Publication history==
As [[superhero]]es began to fade out of fashion in the post-war era, [[comic book]] publishers scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing some of the first significant [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroines]] since [[Wonder Woman]]. Those of [[Marvel Comics]]' 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], included [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]], [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], [[Namora]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]], and [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]], and its teen-[[humour|humor]] star [[Millie the Model]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nolan|first=Michelle|url=http://www.cgccomics.com/news/enews/cgc_enews_0408aug.htm#a4|title=The Super Women of Timely|journal=CGC|publisher=newsletter|volume=3|number=8|date=August 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716131244/http://www.cgccomics.com/news/enews/cgc_enews_0408aug.htm#a4|archive-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> Other companies' included [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox Comics]]' revival of [[Quality Comics]]' [[Phantom Lady]] and DC's [[Black Canary]].

The creator of the Blonde Phantom is disputed. [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] says the character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Syd Shores]],<ref name="DonMark"/> but Al Sulman claimed to have created the character during his time as script editor for Timely Comics: "Wonder Woman was popular, so Stan [Lee] thought we should have a heroine, too. So I created a character called 'The Blonde Phantom', and I wrote those strips myself".<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Amash|first1= Jim|last2= Morris|first2= Brian K.|date= August 2011|title= I Had a Liking for the Comic Magazine Business|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 50|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Stan Lee also mentioned this in his article 'There's Money In Comics' from 'Writer's Digest' in 1947, in which he said: "A sample page from a script of "The Blonde Phantom" follows. This is an actual page, just as it was typed by Al Sulman, the writer".<ref>{{cite journal|date= November 1947|title= There's Money in Comics!|journal= [[Writer's Digest]]|issue= Vol. 27 #12| page= 11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.writersdigest.com/improve-my-writing/90-years-cult-classics |title= Celebrating 90 Years of WD: Cult Classics |date= |website= Writer’s Digest University  |access-date=2021-02-03|language= |trans-title=  |archive-date=July 29, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190729225042/https://www.writersdigest.com/improve-my-writing/90-years-cult-classics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.writersdigest.com/be-inspired/stan-lee-1947-guide-to-writing-and-selling-comics |title= Stan Lee's 1947 Guide to Writing and Selling Comics |date= |website= Writer’s Digest University |access-date=2021-02-03 |language=  |trans-title= |archive-date=2019-07-29|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190729225042/https://www.writersdigest.com/improve-my-writing/90-years-cult-classics}}</ref>

The Blonde Phantom debuted in ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #11 (Fall 1946),<ref name="DonMark">[http://www.toonopedia.com/blondeph.htm The Blonde Phantom] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/62lNSQedv?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/blondeph.htm Archived] from the original on October 28, 2011.</ref><ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/blonde%20phantom/sort/chrono/ Blonde Phantom] (character) at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> which became ''Blonde Phantom Comics'' the following issue. The series lasted a little over two years (from #12–22, Winter 1946 to March 1949), during which time the crime fighter also appeared as a backup feature in:
* ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #84–91 (Oct. 1947 – April 1949)
* ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1948)
* ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner Comics]]'' #25–28 & 30 (Spring – Oct. 1948 & Feb. 1949)
* all three issues of ''[[Blackstone, the Magic Detective|Blackstone the Magician]]'' (#2–4, May–Sept. 1948)
* ''[[Namora]]'' #2 (Oct. 1948)
* ''[[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]]'' #2–3 (Oct.-Dec. 1948).<ref name=gcd />

The character was the province of no one artist, and aside from originator Shores, her adventures in this wide variety of comics were [[penciller|pencilled]] by [[Vince Alascia]], [[Ken Bald]], Allen Bellman, [[Carl Burgos]], Vernon Henkel, [[Mike Sekowsky]], [[Ed Winiarski]], the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]], and others. When not [[inker|inking]] themselves, the pencilers were embellished by inkers including [[Al Avison]], [[Jack Binder (comics)|Jack Binder]], and [[Harry Sahle]].<ref name=gcd />

''Blonde Phantom Comics'' changed titles and formats completely to become the [[anthology|anthological]] [[romance comic]] ''Lovers'' with issue #23 (May 1949).<ref name=gcd />

===Concurrent Blonde Phantom===
Comics historian [[Jess Nevins]] notes that the Timely Comics teen-humor character [[Millie the Model|Millie Collins]] wore a mask and veil and posed as the "Blonde Phantom" for a cosmetics company's publicity campaign in a story in ''Millie the Model'' #2 (Oct. 1946), published near the same time as the superheroine Blonde Phantom's debut in ''All-Select Comics'' #11 (Fall 1946). Acknowledging the shared [[Marvel Universe]], Nevins writes that the famous model's stunt "perhaps inspired Louise Grant to put on a costume and fight crime".<ref>[http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/phantom.html The Blonde Phantom (I)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171736/http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/phantom.html |date=March 3, 2016}} at [[Jess Nevins|Nevins, Jess]], [http://www.reocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7160/gaguide.html A Guide to Golden Age Marvel Characters] of latter.</ref><ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/milliemodel.htm Millie the Model] at an International Catalogue of Superheroes</ref>

===Revival===
The character's civilian identity, Louise Mason, was reintroduced in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #2 (June 1989). Two issues later, she was revealed to be the retired former superhero. Mason remained a series cast-member through the final issue, #60 (Feb. 1994).<ref name=gcd-ssh>[http://www.comics.org/series/3858/ ''The Sensational She-Hulk''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> She was featured in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] adventures in ''[[All Select Comics]] 70th Anniversary Special'' (Feb. 2009)<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/38845/ ''All Select Comics 70th Anniversary Special''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> and the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''[[Avengers 1959]]'', beginning with issue #1 (Dec. 2011).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/61425/ ''Avengers 1959''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

In 2011, ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' ranked the Blonde Phantom 98th on its list of the "100 Sexiest Women in Comics".<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff | first = Brent | author-link = Brent Frankenhoff | title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics | publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011 | page = 60 | isbn = 978-1-4402-2988-6}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin and Golden Age adventures===
[[File:AllWinners1-1948.jpg|thumb|left|''All Winners Comics'' vol. 2, #1 (Aug. 1948), cover artist(s) unknown.]]
Louise Grant, born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], was secretary to [[private investigator|private detective]] Mark Mason. Enamored with her boss and wanting to help him break cases, she surreptitiously donned a black [[domino mask]] and a sexy, skintight, slit-leg red [[evening gown]] and [[high-heeled footwear|high heels]], and ventured out at night fighting crime. Highly athletic and seemingly trained in martial arts, the Blonde Phantom also carried a .45-caliber pistol. In a distaff echo of [[Superman]] and [[Lois Lane]], Mason had a crush on the Blonde Phantom, but not on Louise.<ref name=Benton/> At an unspecified point, the Blonde Phantom fought alongside the [[All-Winners Squad]]<!--hyphen OK--> superhero team for an adventure.<ref>[http://www.marveldirectory.com/groupsandteams/allwinners.htm All-Winners Squad] at MarvelDirectory.com, reprinted from ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Teams 2005''</ref>

According to ''Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes'', "she fights ordinary gangsters, [[femme fatale|femmes fatale]], the monstrous Baron Frankenstein, the insane Carlo the Killer, the stage magician criminals the Mad Magicians, and Stillface, a thug whose maimed face was rebuilt with plaster".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=30}}</ref>

===Modern Age===
In Modern Age comics, Louise Grant has left crimefighting to marry her employer, Mark Mason, in 1949 and takes his last name. She gives birth to their daughter Wanda and, later, to son Earl. After her husband's death, she begins working as a legal secretary for [[district attorney]] Blake Tower in the 1989–1994 series ''The Sensational She-Hulk'', acting as the general voice-of-reason for both Tower and Jennifer Walters / [[She-Hulk]].

Mason often finds herself more or less willingly pulled into the She-Hulk's surreal adventures, and occasionally vice versa. They confront many menaces, from [[Stilt-Man]] in issue #4 (Aug. 1989) to a town where stepping out of line, even swearing, is fatally punished. Mason even accompanies She-Hulk into outer space, where the pair become allies of the space-faring hero [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]] and his compatriots U.S. Archer and Al the alien. After being taken prisoner by the subterranean ruler the [[Mole Man]], she's restored to a more youthful version of herself by a mysterious chemical process in issue #33 (Nov. 1991).
[[File:She-Hulk23.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Louise's daughter becomes the Phantom Blonde in ''She-Hulk'' #23 (Jan. 1991). Cover art by Kevin Maguire and Jim Sanders III.]]
Mason, affectionately nicknamed "Weezi", begins a romantic relationship with Jennifer's father, Morris Walters in #36 (Feb. 1992). Mason later finds herself trading physical stature and powers with a none-too-pleased She-Hulk in issue #48–49 (Feb.-March 1993), becoming so enamored with her new form and abilities that she only changes back when Morris reveals he wants Weezi the way she had been.

==Powers and abilities==
The Blonde Phantom had no superhuman powers. She was an athletic woman, a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and a fine markswoman with the conventional handgun she carried. She also had excellent secretarial skills, as the secretary for the Mark Mason Detective Agency, and later as the secretary of New York City District Attorney Blake Tower.

==Phantom Blonde==
Louise's daughter, Wanda Louise Mason, introduced in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #21 (Nov. 1990), briefly followed her mother's crime-fighter legacy, becoming the costumed Phantom Blonde two issues later,<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/phantomblonde.htm Phantom Blonde] at The Appendix to The Handbook of Marvel Universe</ref> in a story by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and penciler Buzz Dixon. She was later considered a "potential recruit" for the US government's superhero-training program, the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]].<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' (March 2007)</ref>

==Other versions==
The Louise Mason version of Blonde Phantom appears as a recurring character in ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'' and its follow-up series, ''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'', both published as part of the young-readers [[Marvel Adventures]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], taking place in a non-canonical alternate reality from mainstream Marvel continuity. Here, she is portrayed as a famed private detective who often works as a confidant to [[Spider-Man]] and his girlfriend [[Sophia "Chat" Sanduval]].<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #58</ref>
