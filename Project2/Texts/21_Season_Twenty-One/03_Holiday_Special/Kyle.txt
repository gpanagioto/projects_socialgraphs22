They what?? Dude! Did you know it's your dad did who's getting the school to cancel Columbus Day? Well, you've gotta do something. If you get him to back down, maybe the school will reconsider. Stan, I have to deal with my mom doing shit like this all the time, but she's never tried to take away a holiday. I'm your best friend, but I can't have your back when the guys find out about this. No! No, wait guys. Maybe that's it. When I'm dealing with my mom, sometimes it works to be on her side for a minute. Maybe we should find out all the things people find offensive about Columbus and- I'll just look up Columbus, offensive, inflammatory- Nnnothing. Stan, can I talk to you for a minute?  What's he saying? No dude, that's too far. Dude, there's nothing we can do, all right? Come on, guys.  There's something else we can try.  That's why we had it transferred to VHS.
