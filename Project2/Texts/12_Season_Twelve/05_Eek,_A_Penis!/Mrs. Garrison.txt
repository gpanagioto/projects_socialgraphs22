It's like, my whole life has just been one big ''screw-up'', you know?  I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I ''still feel'' like a man This sex change was a big mistake, okay?  I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.   What do you want? I'm trying to teach. Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You ''have'' a penis!   What? Holy Freaking Jesus. Doctor, what about a penis? No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me? I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I ''need'' a ''penis''. Mr. Garrison!  Wow! My penis looks great! How long before it's ready? Let me see if it feels right in my hand.  Whoa no! Mah penis!  Stop, penis! Come back here! Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis?  My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese.  What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?! Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere! Holy Crap!   You saw a penis?!  There it goes! Stop you! That's right. Short, and little fluffy ears. Think you got it, Mitch?  Wall come on!   Where is it?! Come on!   Crap! We've gotta go back around! There it is!  No! No! No we, we can find it!  You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis.  I guess it's true. What's that old saying? "If you love your penis, let it go..."
