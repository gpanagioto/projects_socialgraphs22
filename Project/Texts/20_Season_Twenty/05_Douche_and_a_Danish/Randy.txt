	Hey, Mr. Garrison. Come on in, bud. Have a seat, you're not alone. No lynchings here, little cowboy. Take a seat.  You wanna share with us what you're goin' through? It's not your fault, little guy. 	Not your fault. You've gotta stop blaming yourself. Here, catch.  That... is why millions of Americans want you to be President. But there's more... Every great empire reaches a point where going backward can seem more appealing than forward. When the world is changing so fast it makes us yearn for the old ways, when life seemed simpler. But it doesn't mean those old ideas are good for us now. We have to face one hard reality as a country.  The new Star Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was. It may seem fun to go back and recycle the past we loved, but we end up with no sustenance. Well, that's important too, I guess, but, it's just a symptom of the same thing. See, when a civilization has become so big it starts to get lazy, then that's  Once too many Romans ate the member berries there was no more growth. They rested on their laurels just eating and 'membering all the good stuff. Thought so too till I zoomed in.  You see, we all wanna go back to when we were kids. Simple ideas like a big man to protect us, keep us safe. Instead of a fresh new Star Wars we want the old, just recycled and plopped in our tummies. Does this look familiar?
