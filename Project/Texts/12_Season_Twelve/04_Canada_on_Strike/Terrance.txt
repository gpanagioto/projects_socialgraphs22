Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.  Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit. But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic. Don't call me a rat, buddih! He's not your buddih, friend! Yeah, let's give it up, guy. Well I'm not your friend, buddih! Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars! We're setting you adrift, idiot! He's not your guy, friend!
