We interrupt this broadcast for a news bulletin.  Mass murderer and extremely nasty person Charles Manson has escaped from prison! Manson was the man responsible for seven murders in the late '60's. Manson has never shown any signs of remorse for his crimes. If you see Manson, please kick his ass and smash his fucking face in for me, and then call the police. And now back to the game. A high speed car chase is happening right now on interstate 3. We go now to our live sky-fi helicopter.
