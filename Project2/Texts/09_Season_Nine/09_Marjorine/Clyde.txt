I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement.   NOW ''DAMN'' YOU, LET HIM ''SPEAK''! Where did they get that thing?  It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with. Nice. You're gonna be fine. Good luck, man.  Then, he's already dead. How come you get to use it first? Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday. Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.
