Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together?  Let's see, how about... Wendy? Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?  Kyle? Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person ''wrote'' the Declaration of Independence?  No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again. Timmy, did you not do your homework?! Don't call people names, Stanley! Now, Timmy,— —You need to work on your study skills! Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office! THAT DOES IT! Hurry up, children, let's take our seats.  A note from the principal? "Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."  Oh, brother! That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor! Very well, I guess you're excused from homework. Okay, children, let's settle down!  Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!  This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
