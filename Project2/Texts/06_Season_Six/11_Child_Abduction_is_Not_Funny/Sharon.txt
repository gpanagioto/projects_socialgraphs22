A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy. Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim. It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth. I wouldn't worry about that. Congratulations on your victory, boys.  Turn it up. Stanley, time for us to get back to the house. NOW, Stanley!  Right. Do what you normally would do. Good-bye, son.  Remember to eat right. Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay. Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town off to live on their own? I know.  My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!!  Randy, can we just take our son home now?
