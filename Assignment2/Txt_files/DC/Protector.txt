The '''Protector''' ('''Jason Hart''') is a superhero who occasionally teams up with the [[Teen Titans]]. He somewhat replaces [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] temporarily in the three 1983 ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' anti-drug comic specials written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and penciled by [[George Pérez]].

==Publication history==
The first anti-drug special issue was sponsored by [[Keebler]], and Robin was at the time licensed by [[Nabisco]] so the Protector was used as a substitute. Coinciding with the issue was an anti-drug cartoon television advertisement that may have been a test for a Titans television show. As Robin was already a member of the popular ''[[Super Friends]]'' he would not have been available.<ref>[http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/nttanimated.html Titans Tower Theater: New Teen Titans<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016051509/http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/nttanimated.html |date=October 16, 2006}}</ref> Despite the fact that the Protector hardly appeared outside of the three anti-drug PSA comics, he is regarded as a member of the team as confirmed in the ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe#Who.27s Who Update .2787|DC Who's Who Update '87]]'' comic.

==Fictional character biography==
Jason Hart is a high school student and an expert in sports until the day he discovered that his little cousin Ted got hooked on to some drugs. After his parents tried to talk Ted out of taking the drugs, Jason learned of his love of superheroes and became a superhero called Protector. In order to save Ted, Protector fought the drug dealers which attracted the attention of [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]. While making him an honorary member of the Teen Titans, Nightwing trained Protector in the art of hand-to-hand combat.<ref>''The New Teen Titans Drug Awareness Special (Keebler)'' (1983). DC Comics.</ref>

Jason finally made another appearance attending a superhero party held by [[Beast Boy]].<ref>''Titans Secret Files'' #2 (October 2000). DC Comics.</ref> Later, he also appeared in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' hardcover collected edition in an added two-page spread.

During the ''[[Heroes in Crisis]]'' storyline, Protector checked himself into Sanctuary to deal with the stress of vigilante work.<ref>''Heroes in Crisis'' #3. DC Comics.</ref> It was revealed that he has a drug addiction problem.<ref>''Heroes in Crisis'' #5. DC Comics.</ref> He was among the heroes who was killed in an unexpected attack.<ref>''Heroes in Crisis'' #6. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Protector is an expert in hand-to-hand combat.

==Other versions==
The Protector appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (2004 comic series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' #52 as an alternate alias of [[Robby Reed]]. Unknown to both Robby and the Titans, his Hero Dial borrows power from any hero who's in close proximity to him, and thus becomes The Protector when Robin is close by.<ref>''Teen Titans Go'' #52. DC Comics.</ref> The Protector appears again in #55, although if it's still Robby Reed is doubtful.<ref>''Teen Titans Go'' #55. DC Comics.</ref>

A version of the Protector shows up in ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' issues #16 and 46.<ref>''Tiny Titans'' #16. DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Tiny Titans'' #46. DC Comics.</ref>
