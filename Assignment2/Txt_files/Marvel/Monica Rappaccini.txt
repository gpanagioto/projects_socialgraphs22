'''Monica Rappaccini''' exists as a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''Amazing Fantasy'' vol. 2 #7 (2005), created by [[Fred Van Lente]] and [[Leonard Kirk]]. The character is depicted as a genius-level [[biochemist]] and the '''[[Scientist Supreme]]''' of the supervillain organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] She has briefly dated both [[Bruce Banner]] and fellow A.I.M. agent [[George Tarleton]] and is the mother of [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Carmilla Black]].

==Fictional character biography==
Monica's first invention was an electric knife to help her mother slice ham; she never got over losing the science fair to a tomato sauce-spouting volcano model.<ref name="amw3">''Ant-Man & Wasp'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While enrolled as a biochemistry student at the [[University of Padua]], Monica Rappaccini went to [[New Mexico]]'s Desert State University to study and shared a brief relationship with physics student [[Hulk|Robert Bruce Banner]]. The ruthless Monica used their relationship to exploit Banner's radiation expertise for her own research. Upon attaining her doctorate, Monica quickly became a world-renowned innovator of antitoxins and antidotes for various environmental poisons and nearly won the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>''Amazing Fantasy'' (vol. 2) #7-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Recognizing the many environmental and political failings of Western civilization, Monica decided that it was too corrupt to exist. She joined a series of terrorist organizations - first the pan-European leftist group the [[Black Orchestra]], then [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (or A.I.M. for short), where she had a brief relationship with fellow agent [[MODOK|George Tarleton]].<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1, page 1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Making poisons instead of curing them, Monica's expertise with toxins allowed her to rise quickly through A.I.M.'s ranks. She implanted her own daughter and several other newborn children of A.I.M. members with memetic antibodies and released them into the world as A.I.M. Waker agents with no knowledge of their heritage, programmed to travel instinctively to the nearest A.I.M. biohaven when their antibodies activated at age 16. Monica's daughter was raised in [[Vermont]] as [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Carmilla Black]] by undercover A.I.M. agents.<ref>Scorpion debut story in ''Amazing Fantasy''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Monica went underground for nearly two decades, studying potential power sources such as the sentient [[Captain Universe|Uni-Power]] and orchestrating attacks on capitalism, such as the dioxin-based gas attack on [[Hong Kong]]. When the A.I.M. [[Scientist Supreme]] was slain by renegade A.I.M. creation MODOK, Monica became head of a splinter faction of A.I.M. that remained independent from MODOK's control. Following MODOK's numerous defeats, Monica's splinter group absorbed more cells into a sizable rival faction, and she was made Scientist Supreme of this "true" version of A.I.M.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1, MODOK profile. Marvel Comics.</ref> As A.I.M.'s leader, Monica rarely did field work, preferring to act through agents and proxies.

When she led an A.I.M. attack on the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, it was thwarted by her estranged 19-year-old daughter, who had since joined forces with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and became the costumed superheroine the Scorpion II. Monica eluded capture and soon attempted to harness the malfunctioning Uni-Power, but her plans were thwarted by the Scorpion II and several superheroes who bonded with the Uni-Power.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Her A.I.M. faction was involved in an A.I.M. civil war against MODOK's faction that drew in several of the Marvel superheroes, prominent among them [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #5, 7 and 9-10. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #287-290. Marvel Comics.</ref>Following Ms. Marvel's thwarting of a plan to turn MODOK into a bomb, Monica reunited the organization under her control.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' (vol. 2) #15-17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Monica infiltrated MODOK's supervillain group MODOK's 11 with A.I.M.'s new robot the [[Super-Adaptoid|Ultra-Adaptoid]] (which was impersonating the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]). She attempted to prevent MODOK from obtaining a weapon called the Hypernova and using it to erase all life on Earth. She had a stated aim to stop A.I.M. from creating "inventions that turn around and try to destroy us". In the end, MODOK gained the Hypernova and Monica gave him $1 billion dollars in exchange for it - which, unknown to her, had been MODOK's plan all along, as he had already worked out that the Hypernova would grow unstable and explode anyway. A.I.M.'s base was destroyed in the explosion and MODOK believed Monica was dead.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, it is revealed that she survived and came into conflict with [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Clint Barton|Ronin]].<ref>''New Avengers: The Reunion'' #2-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> She also hired [[Deadpool]] to retrieve a batch of baby M.O.D.O.C.'s enhanced to warp reality from [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] headquarters.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' (vol. 2) #40-41. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After a failed attempt to persuade [[Hank Pym]] to join A.I.M., Monica and her followers were stranded on [[Earth-Charnel]] when the Wasp deactivated her facility's dimensional screen.<ref name="amw3"/>

Monica and A.I.M. later sided with [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] after he escaped from prison and reformed H.A.M.M.E.R.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following Osborn's defeat, Monica and A.I.M. end up retreating.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, [[Noh-Varr]] located a secret A.I.M. base where Monica Rappaccini and the A.I.M. agents that escaped following Osborn's defeat were hiding out. The Avengers raided the base and arrested Monica and the other A.I.M. members that were present at the time.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She then escaped from prison and fought the new [[Nadia van Dyne|Wasp]].

In the pages of the "Ravencroft" miniseries, Monica was seen as a member of J.A.N.U.S.<ref>''Ravencroft'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
A biochemical genius, Monica is one of the world's foremost authorities on organic toxins.  Her inventions include the enhanced lymphatic system of the A.I.M. Waker agents that granted them total immunity to all biological, chemical and radiological weapons; memetic antibodies, synthetic microbes that attack the human psyche and trigger pre-coded memories and impulses; hallucinogenic drugs that deliver programmed hallucinations before being absorbed into the system; and many innovative weapons of mass destruction, from gas attacks to nanobacterial bombs. Monica's A.I.M. uniform belt contains a phasing device that allows her to [[Teleportation|teleport]] short distances. She keeps many different devices at hand, varying upon her situation and opponent; when facing a captured Hank Pym, she boasts that she kept 157 methods of containing him on hand.<ref name="amw3"/>
