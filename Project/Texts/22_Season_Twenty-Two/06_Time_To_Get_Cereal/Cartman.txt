Staci Nakabw says he just wanted to run back out and get his football. Dude, now you're just overreacting. Aww, what did I do this time? You go first, Kenny. I didn't even do anything wrong! Just stop being a baby, Kenny, and go!  Nobody gives a shit about Colin Brooks. Hey, I'm not poor, all right?! You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? You guys! You guys! The police are trying to say me and Kenny killed that douchebag, Colin Brooks. They questioned us for hours. They said they had enough to get warrants for our arrest. We know that! What the hell are we gonna do??  We're sorry for making fun of you. You told us to.  Ngh! You're still not even gonna help us?! You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? This is stupid. Oh Jesus. You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore! Tell them it wasn't us!
