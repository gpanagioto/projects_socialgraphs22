 Eric! Are you training that pony to please you? Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know. Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis? Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there. Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter.  Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.  No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill. Ooh, what's a Radiohead? Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned! Nice thinking, young hunter. What? What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out! Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined! Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it? Well, stop it!   Oh crap!  Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!
