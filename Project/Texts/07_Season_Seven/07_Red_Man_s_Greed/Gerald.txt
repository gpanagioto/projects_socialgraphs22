All right, time to show these people how to gamble!  Ohh, not so good. Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand. I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem. Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out! The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.  Wha- what's in the cup?  Oh God. Oh Jesus.  Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass! How am I going to tell my family?    What, What did you say?  No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving! Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling a moving company right now!  Yeah! But wait.  Let it ride!!
