We're gonna miss what? Who's Paris Hilton? I don't get it. What's she do? ...But what does she ''do''?  What does she do?! You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton? But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender! Hey, Jessie , Hey, Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange. Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum? What?! Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society. It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon. I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.  Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong! Dad! Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight. I'm a stupid spoiled whore.  That's okay. Yes. No, I need help. Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend. No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know. Can you teach me your secret fast? Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.  What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there. That's okay, you guys.
