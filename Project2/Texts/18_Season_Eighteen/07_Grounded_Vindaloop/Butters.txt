WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it. I feel Stan! He looks totally real! More of the school.  The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.  What what what?  Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot! I'm sorry! Yeah.  Okay, I'm back in your room!  Wow! That was cool! I touched Wendy's boob.  Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric? Yeah.  Well, not a hundred percent... Okay, subject is ready. Interim status is go. It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal. Going now!  Okay. How much more of this am I supposed to clear up? Okay. It's so realistic.  Alright, I think that's all of it.  There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me! Okay, I got it! Already? Oh no! I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick.  Hello, Dad! It's me, Butters! This is for all the times I got grounded!  HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?! Huh, that was incredible! I feel amazing!   Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like ''Grand Theft Auto''! Whoa! I'm in the car now. Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here. I'm gonna beat her up and take her money! Take that, you dumb hooker! I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me. I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH! I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality. Aw nuts! I wonder how long I'm grounded for? Ahhh! Eric! Uh what are you doing here? What?  Nuh uh! WHAT??   Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop! Ah how do you know that?! Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine! NO!  Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this! ...What? What do you mean? I don't know what you mean. Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world! Oh really? Oh, that's a relief. Oh gosh! OH GOSH! Yeah. Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded! No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle! I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense! PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the- Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh-    you guys can't be here. Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors. When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life. YES.  AAaaghagh! Huh I'm sorry Dad!  Ahhh, huh? You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded? They did it!  Whoopie!  Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore.
