South Park Elementary, Friday during the day, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids enter the classroom

Mrs. Garrison

[enters and drops her books on her desk in anger] Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it! [some papers flutter off the top of the stack. She turns and erases some addition problems she had up on the blackboard earlier] Stupid ass man! They're all the same! [Stan crosses his arms and buries his head in them. He's the only student to do so]

Kyle

Oh God, here we go again.

Mrs. Garrison

All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, "Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!

Stan

Uh oh, this isn't good.

Mrs. Garrison

[gets into Stan's face] Did I say something to you, sugartits?!

Stan

[frightened] No ma'am.

Mrs. Garrison

[heads back to the blackboard] You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, "The Old Man and the Sea"!

Cartman

Have you lost your mind?

Stan

Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.

Mrs. Garrison

Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!

Butters

But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.

Mrs. Garrison

If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!

-----


South Park Elementary, after school, outside. The students exit and head home.

Stan

Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?

Kyle

Our whole weekend is shot.

Kenny

(What the hell are we going to do?!)

Cartman

You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.

Stan

We don't?

Cartman

No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.

-----


Moovit Truck Rental, in the industrial section of South Park, Friday afternoon. A group of Mexican day laborers stand around waiting for work. Cartman and friends approach them. And Cartman whistles

Cartman

¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? ¿Sí? ¿Trabajo?

Laborer 1

[wearing baseball cap with flag] Yeis.

Laborer 2

[wearing cap backwards] We looking work, sí.

Cartman

[holds his arms out in open embrace] Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read [whips out the book from his back pocket] "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "E Old Mand Y La Mer".

Laborer 2

Okay.

Laborer 1

Sure.

Laborer 3

[wearing NY baseball cap] Okay.

Laborer 4

[wearing gray baseball cap] Yeah.

Cartman

Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.

Laborer 2

Okay no problem. That's no problem.

Laborer 1

Yeah, we can do that.

Laborer 5

Sí, la samaraisia.

Cartman

Okay, gracias.

Stan and Kyle

Gracias.

Stan

Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.

Cartman

Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.

-----


Curves, a fitness and weight loss center, day. Mrs. Garrison is running hard on a treadmill, taking out her frustrations.

Mrs. Garrison

They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are! [a woman walks up and gets on the treadmill to her right]

Woman

Are you okay, hon?

Mrs. Garrison

I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how hot you look!

Woman

Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.

Mrs. Garrison

Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.

Woman

I'm Allyson.

Mrs. Garrison

Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.

Allyson

No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman.

Janet

Yeah, I've been told that.

Allyson

How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?

Janet

Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.

Allyson

Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called "Lebow".

-----


Les Bos, night, 13280. "Lebow" is the French pronunciation of Les Bos. Allyson and Janet approach the front door. Allyson leads Janet in.

Allyson

Hi Linda, hi Kate.

Woman 2

Hey Allyson.

Woman 3

Who's the new girl?

Woman 2

Allyson always goes for the butch ones.

Allyson

[approaches the bar with Janet] Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?

Janet

Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.

Allyson

Yeah. Well, most of the girls here have done each other. [gets a glass and a beer and pours the beer into the glass.]

Janet

He-yeah. Done what?

Allyson

You know. [smiles] Had sex. [passes the beer to Janet and orders a second beer for herself.]

Janet

[looks around] Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?

Allyson

Yeah. I... thought you understood that.

Janet

Oh jeez. [fans herself]

Allyson

I'm sorry. I thought you knew what "girl bar" meant.

Janet

But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. [moves away]

-----


Les Bos, bathroom. Janet is washing her face.

Allyson

Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a-

Janet

I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!

Allyson

Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?

Janet

Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda [demonstrates with her fingers] scissor or something.

Allyson

There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.

Janet

I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.

Allyson

Could I... maybe kiss you? [gets close, but Janet turns and walks away]

Janet

Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!

Allyson

Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go. Let's just have fun tonight. [they hold hands] No commitments. [Allyson lets go] Just fun. [she grabs her hand and they close in for the kiss]

-----


Janet's bedroom, later. Janet and Allyson are going at it in bed.

Janet

Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!

Allyson

Janet, you're crazy!

Janet

Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!

-----


South Park, Monday, just before dawn. The boys walk over to Moovit Trucking to meet up with the laborers and get their finished essays.

Kyle

They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!

Cartman

They'll be done. [whistles to get the laborers' attention.] ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? [the laborers approach] All right, did you read the book?

Laborers

Sí, sí.

Kyle

What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.

Laborer 1

Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh.

Laborer 2

Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh.

Laborer 5

So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.

Kyle

He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.

Laborer 1

No, because on the way home, the sharks come and eat the feesh. And so, he no make money. [all five laborers take off their hats and put them against their chests in mourning]

Stan

That's it, that's the whole story?

Laborer 1

Sí.

Cartman

All right, did you write the four essays?

Laborer 1

Sí, we all wrote essays for you. [the laborers put their caps back on]

The Boys

[all thumbs up] All right!

Cartman

Okay, let's have 'em.

Laborer 4

Have what?

Kyle

You said you all wrote essays.

Laborer 1

Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet.

Laborer 2

I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.

Laborer 5

I wrote three eses: my ese back home, my ese in Denver, and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back. "Thanks for writing me, ese." [the boys are stunned]

Kenny

(Uh oh...)

Kyle

Dude, we're totally fucked now!

Cartman

Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!

Laborer 1

We thought it was kind of strange.

Kyle

This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!

Stan

You guys, school starts in ten minutes!

Kyle

Son of a bitch! [the boys turn and head for school]

-----


South Park Elementary, Monday morning, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids enter the classroom

Stan

[sees Clyde] Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde! [Clyde turns around] You didn't finish your essay either, right?

Clyde

No, I got it done. [turns and walks to his desk. Jimmy walks up beside the boys]

Kyle

Jimmy, did you finish your book report?

Jimmy

Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. [walks off, leaving the boys dumbfounded]

Cartman

Crap! [the boys head for their seats]

Kyle

We're dead.

Mrs. Garrison

[dances into the room and sings] Hello, class. Here's my little desk [strokes it gently], my nice lil chalkboard. [hugs it. The boys are surprised at her behavior]

Cartman

Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.

Mrs. Garrison

[acting bashful] Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so.

Kyle

[looks at Cartman, then at Stan. Stan looks back at both of them] Really?

Mrs. Garrison

Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking. [sighs] I'm gay. [silence follows]

Stan

Again?

Mrs. Garrison

[sits on the edge of her desk, right leg over left] It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called "Les Bos" where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we... [demonstrates] scissored all night long.

Butters

You have to be careful with scissors.

Mrs. Garrison

But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right? [closes her eyes] Oh I'm so happy.

Cartman

That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!

Class

Yay!

Mrs. Garrison

[blushing and hides behind her hands] Teeheeheehee.

-----


Les Bos, night. Janet goes to the bar alone.

Janet

[now confident] Hey Tracy, hey Kate.

Tracy

Hi Janet.

Janet

Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? [moves away]

Linda

[Woman 2] Huh?

Janet

Hey Patty.

Patty

What's up, Janet.

Janet

[lights a cigarette] Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.

Big Woman

Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl? [Janet flicks the cigarette away and leaves her seat, comes up behind the big woman and pulls her down on her stool to the ground and starts punching her.]

Janet

Oh yeah, dyke fight! [they roll around on the floor and the big woman gets away. The other women gather to watch. the big woman lands a kick to Janet's groin] You kicked me right in the pussy! [the fight resumes and they tumble into a booth, fighting all the way to the floor again. The big woman fights Janet off, but Janet gets turned on and starts having sex...] Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! [the big woman, distracted for a moment, goes back to attacking Janet.]

Lesbian 4

You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news.

Lesbian 5

What is it, Katie?

Katie

They're closing down the bar. For good!

Linda

Closing it down? They can't do that.

Lesbian 6

[blonde] This is our home.

Janet

Yeah, this is our home.

Katie

Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians.

Janet

Persians?!

Tracy

So where are we supposed to go?

Janet

We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!

-----


City Hall, the Mayor's Office, day. Janet and the other lesbians are in the office.

Janet

Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!

Mayor McDaniels

You're a lesbian now?

Janet

That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!

Mayor McDaniels

The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.

Janet

Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!

Lesbians

Yeah, that's right!

Mayor McDaniels

I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.

Janet

[approaches the desk] Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!

Mayor McDaniels

Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.

-----


Les Bos, later. The lesbians gather there for one last time.

Tracy

Well, here's to some great times at this place.

Lesbian 7

Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.

Janet

Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!

Allyson

Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?

Janet

We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."

Katie

Actually, it's "Lebow".

Janet

[faces Katie with a ready fist to be pumped] No, it's Les Bos! [addressing all the lesbians] We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!

Linda

[coming into view] The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.

Emir

Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar.

Lesbian 6

Yes, we are.

Emir

Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.

Janet

I knew it! I knew it!

Emir

But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.

Janet

Would you allow straight people in? Men?

Emir

Well... we would allow whoev-

Janet

Choose your next words wisely, Persian! [jabs a finger into Emir's chest. Emir backs away]

Emir

Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy.

Janet

No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! [kicks him in the groin and walks away]

Emir

Ohhhhh!

Persian

How dare you! [Janet is shown in slow motion, her hips swaying back and forth]

Narrator

And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. [Emir throws up on the floor]. All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff.

Anchor

As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.

Lesbian 8

Good for them!

Lesbian 9

You go girls! [she takes a chip and bites into it. The bite is shown in slow motion.]

Narrator

The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.

Tumon

Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help. [turns left and picks up a phone in slow mo, then a fast-forward to dialing the numbers. The dialing is shown in slow motion. Next shot is Les Bos under a sepia sky]

Narrator

The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering.

Lesbian 6

Here they come. [the Persians approach, but stop short]

Big Woman

There's so many of them.

Janet

Lesbos! Positions! [they all take a battle stance]

Tumon

Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!

Janet

The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!

Tumon

All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!

Persians

[charging forward] Huuu! [slow motion feet are shown]

Janet

Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight! [the battle begins with both sides pushing, the line going back and forth] Don't give them an inch! [she gets poked somewhere] Ow! Iranian faggot!

Tumon

Come on, seriously, let us in!

Janet

Never!

Narrator

For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating. [Janet and the second Persian are shown in intense shoving combat] Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated. [and threw down their weapons] The Lesbos... had held.

Janet

Lesbohhhs!

Lesbians

Huok! Huok!

Narrator

The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.

Tumon

[turns around] Here he comes. [the others turn to see. An opulent Hummer draws closer and closer]

Narrator

Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool. [four men pour out of the Hummer and arrange themselves into steps in front of the grille]

Tumon

Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.

Xerxes

[deep voice] Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle.

Narrator

And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.

Xerxes

I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.

-----


Les Bos, the aftermath of the Battle of South Park. The improvised weapons are strewn all over the street.

Janet

Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.

Allyson

Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives.

Janet

We can't? I think it's pretty fun.

Linda

We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.

Lesbian 10

[WNBA player] Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner.

Janet

Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.

Allyson

Whattaya mean?

Janet

If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!

Allyson

But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.

Janet

It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.

-----


Moovit Trucking, day. Janet shows up with Women 6 and 8 and whistles at the laborers.

Janet

¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

Laborer 1

Yeis.

Laborer 2

We looking work, sí.

Janet

All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.

Laborer 2

Okay.

Laborer 1

Sure.

Laborer 3

[wearing NY baseball cap] Okay.

Laborer 4

[wearing gray baseball cap] Yeah.

Allyson

Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian.

Janet

Sure they do. [walks over to one of the laborers, Laborer 1, and works on him] Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne. [shields her eyes from the cologne, then presents the new man] Persian.

Laborer 1

Sí. [the two women smile]

Lesbian 6

Wow!

Janet

All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.

Laborer 1

Okay.

Laborer 5

No problem.

Laborer 2

Yes.

Laborer 4

Sí. [they turn around and walk away]

Janet

And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.

-----


Les Bos, stormy sky, day. The camera pans down from the sky.

Narrator

A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee. [Janet turns around (fast motion) and heads to the kitchen (slow motion). She enters the kitchen (fast motion) and grabs the glass kettle from the coffee maker (slow motion). She turns towards the sink (fast motion), and pours water into the kettle (slow motion). She turns back to the coffee maker (fast motion) and pour the water into it (slow motion). She closes the water cover, opens the coffee cover, gets some coffee, returns (all fast motion), and pours the coffee into the coffee filter (slow motion). She closes the coffee cover (fast motion) and presses the on button (slow motion).] With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?

Lesbian 6

[standing on a booth bench and looking out a window] The Persians are attacking again!

Janet

Take positions, Lesbos!

Lesbian 11

Get outside! [the lesbians begin to move towards the door]

Janet

No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.

Linda

Really?

Allyson

How can you tell?

Janet

Let them through. It's okay.

Laborer 3

Hola, ¿como estas?

Laborer 4

Hola.

Janet

Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?

Laborer 4

Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal.

Janet

A-are you sure?

Laborer 1

No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge.

Janet

What secret?! [Laborer 4 hands him some photos] Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?

Laborers

Sí.

Allyson

Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone.

Janet

It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.

-----


Les Bos, outside, moments later. Xerxes descends from his throne as Janet approaches

Xerxes

Why are you lesbians being so difficult?

Janet

Because we're protecting the only home we have.

Xerxes

I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.

Janet

You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.

Xerxes

Okay, how about this? [stands behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders] I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money.

Janet

That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you. [takes Xerxes' left hand and sniffs it] I know you're actually a woman.

Xerxes

[lets go and backs away quickly] How..? How did you find that out?

Janet

I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.

Xerxes

You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.

Janet

Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking. [Xerxes wasn't expecting this response] But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!

Xerxes

You do? Seriously?

Janet

Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?

Xerxes

No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of [demonstrates with her fingers] scissor or something.

-----


Janet's bedroom, later. Janet and Xerxes are going at it in bed.

Janet

Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!

Xerxes

Ohh, that feels so supercool!

Janet

Yeah, scissor!

Xerxes

Ohh, I'm a new woman!

-----


Les Bos, next day. A bright blue sky and fluffy clouds grace it.

Narrator

And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.

Janet

Thanks for everything, Xerxes.

Xerxes

No. Thank you, friend.

Allyson

Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?

Janet

The school hired a substitute to cover for me.

-----


South Park Elementary, morning, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids are quietly paying attention

Laborer 1

Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator. [the five laborers the boys first hired are there]

Laborer 2

Sí.

Laborers

Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. That's right.

Laborer 4

Sí.

Stan

These guys are pretty good.

Kyle

Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. [both boys resume taking notes.]

-----
