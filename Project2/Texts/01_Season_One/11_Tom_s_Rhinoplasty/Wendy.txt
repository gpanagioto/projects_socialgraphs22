Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day. Maybe we should go on a cruise or something. I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and ''pretend'' it's a cruise.  -and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.  Stan? ''Stan?!''  Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one? ''Well it is!'' Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?  Stan? We're still Valentines, right? Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you? I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan. Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen? Don't fuck with me! You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen. When someone gets as old as you, Do they have to wear Depends undergarments? Hi, Stan. ''HI, STAN!'' I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen. ''Yes, she was!'' Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it! It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun! ''NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!'' Thanks for coming over, Bebe. That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes ''everything'' from me, Bebe. Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice ''me'' again. Bebe, I need a makeover. Hi guys, what's up? Oh. Hi, Stan. I think it worked, Bebe. DIE!! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison! He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now. Wwhat? You...you ''can't''. Noooo! Noooo! ''Nooo!! Nooo!!'' AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! It's over. I give up. Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you? No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting. No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends. And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong, ...and I've learned from it. I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world. Oh, coool! Wow. What incredible irony. Yeah, you just never know. Happy Valentine's Day, Staan. Eeewwww! No, it's okay, Stan! Everything's going to be o-kay! Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher. Oh, hi, Kyle! U-huh. Excuse me. Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq! Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq! Kaqemblaq! Wait, wait! It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing! Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen. I told her.  Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!
