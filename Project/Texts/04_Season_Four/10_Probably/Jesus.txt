Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school. God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him. But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins! No. Worse!
