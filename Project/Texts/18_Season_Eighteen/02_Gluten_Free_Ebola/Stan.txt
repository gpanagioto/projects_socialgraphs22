Morning!  Hey Wendy. Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out. So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie- Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing. Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says?   For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on! Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something. What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down.  Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him. Sweet! Excuse me? Wait, wait, ah I might need those. We can't let our party suck.  Dad? Dad! Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something? Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you? Nonono, not yet. DAD! Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD! Let me talk to my dad!  There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have. I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but- Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now... We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid! Hey Wendy, you havin' fun? Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me. What does that mean?
