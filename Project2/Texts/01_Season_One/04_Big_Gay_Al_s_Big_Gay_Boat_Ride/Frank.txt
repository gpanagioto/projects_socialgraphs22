Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up. Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski. Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes! Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter. Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King. Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that. With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0. Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant. Sorry, sorry. And the South Park Cows are set to receive... There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick. He's at the 50, the 40, the 30. The little running back is down. I think he's... Yes, he's been decapitated. Ouch-a-roo! Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot. And now, here to sing the touching song ''Loving You'', is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother... And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since... Well, this should just about wrap it up for- Wait a minute, what's this? It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback! Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass. And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid! Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938! Touchdown! The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread! Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory? Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?
