Butters, never get into a car with a stranger. Unless it's a limousine. Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear? Your girlfriend?  Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money? Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son!  So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels. Butters is our son. He's not for sale. Excuse me?! Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk. Butters, right now! Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents ''not'' to consider it. I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family. Yes, us, the rest of the family. Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton. Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars.  It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front. All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay. It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!  Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal? Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her. Oh that trouble making son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister! So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy! You're a grounded old bear.
