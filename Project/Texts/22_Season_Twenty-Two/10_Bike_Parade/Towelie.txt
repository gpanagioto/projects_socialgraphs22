 We need to find a way to get the weed to the people. You know what they got? They got these e-scooters nowadays. What if we use e-scooters to get the weed directly to the customers? Hello, sir. I have your weed delivery. There you are, ma'am.  Enjoy your Tegridy. We're here to please the customer!  Hello, sir. I have your weed delivery.  Hello, sir. I'm with the Tegridy Weed Company. We're just makin' sure folks are aware of our new rewards program. We now have three levels of membership for our weed. There's Tegridy, Tegridy Plus, and Tegridy Elite. But you don't want to be elite, 'cause elite's got no Tegridy.
