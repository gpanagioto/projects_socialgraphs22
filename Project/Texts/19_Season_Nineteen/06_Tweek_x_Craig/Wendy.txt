Hey, guys. As you know, we have several new students here at South Park Elementary. We have been getting to know some of the Asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called "yaoi."  Kelly Zhou goes a bit more whimsical with "Craig and Tweek: Moonlight Dance."  In yaoi art, the seme, or "top", is usually dominating the uke, or "bottom", as demonstrated in Heather Nishimura's "Boizu Rabu."  But yaoi can branch out to other things as well... ...as we see here in "Lily, Frog, Tweek and Craig."
