South Park Elementary, day. The hallway is full of students. Kyle walks down the hallway. Jimmy passes him going the other way, but notices him and walks over.

Jimmy

Oh! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks over his shoulder] Kyle, hang on a sec. [He's holding his phone, on which is a Terrance & Phillip game]

Kyle

[turns to face him] Hey, Jimmy. What's up?

Jimmy

Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.

Kyle

Oh. Really?

Jimmy

Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?

Kyle

[considers it for a moment] Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.

Jimmy

You betcha, pal. [grins. Kyle turns and walks away and the grin fades. Jimmy turns and continues on his way]

-----


Close-up view of the Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game

Announcer

The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game. [The game goes from the splash screen to a layout of their town, starting at their house. Coins float over the streets, ready to be grabbed. The announcer pops into view] In this game, you are Terrance & Phillip. Can you collect all the Canadian coins? *poot* [disappears.]

-----


South Park Elementary, side entrance. Kyle has downloaded the game and is now playing it while Butters sits next to him on the steps and watches. Kyle taps on a coin...

Announcer

That's one coin. Can you collect more? [Kyle taps on more coins on the screen] You've collected ten Canadian coins! [a big red 10 appears on a yellow star] Congratulations! [that word, also in red, appears above the 10] Hey, you're really good at this, guy!

Kyle

What?

Butters

Congratulations, Kyle.

Announcer

[pops up again] With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada. [only five buildings, all houses, are shown, with the rest of the area being undeveloped] Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk! [a Royal Bank price chart appears, with purchases going from 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents to 5700 for $50] How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?

Kyle

This is stupid!

Butters

Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. [Kyle taps on the button and coins pop out at him]

Announcer

You buy 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents! You're amazing! Now use that Canadough to help rebuild Canada! Click to build a hospital here. [a floating red arrow pops up on the empty block across from Terrance & Phillip's house. Kyle taps on it and the hospital appears]

Terrance & Phillip

Yaaay!

Kyle

It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!

Cartman

[approaching wit Kenny] What are you two boners doing?

Butters

We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.

Cartman

I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.

Kyle

Who makes this crap?

-----


The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. It's a busy place, as suits go in and out of the building. A hockey skater zips by on the street with a puck. Inside, in a meeting room, two men are at a table. One of them is on a laptop while the other watches. The meeting room is ringed with curtains

Minister

Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!

Prince

Where is the roof on this thing?

Terrance

[the double doors burst open and Terrance & Phillip storm their way in] What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!

Minister

Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?

Phillip

What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!

Prince

Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming.

Minister

We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.

Phillip

It's the dumbest game ever! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!

Prince

Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!

Phillip

But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!

Minister

[low voice] They see through the charade.

Prince

Uh oh, you think so?

Minister

I think they see through the charade, yes.

Prince

I'm pretty sure they can hear us too. [Yes, and they're not pleased one bit.]

Minister

Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up! [walks up to a large heavy rope and pulls on it. A bell sounds and the curtain around the room go up, revealing white boards that show how the mobile game is set up. Terrance & Phillip are suddenly bewildered] Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years, gaming was simple: you pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps, we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you pay for incentives, you're rewarded!

Prince

Free"mium". The "mium" is Latin for "not really."

Minister

It's a simple cycle, a never-ending loop based on RPGs: Explore -> Collect -> Spend -> Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money.

Prince

It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun!

-----


The Marsh house, evening. Randy and Sharon have Stan on the sofa

Randy

You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! [whips out a phone bill. Sharon's arms are crossed]

Stan

I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much.

Randy

You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"?

Stan

You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.

Randy

Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!

Stan

I'll pay you back for it, okay?!

Randy

How?!

Stan

I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ!

-----


The master bedroom, later. Randy changes into red pajamas while Sharon is already in her white ones sipping some water.

Randy

Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter! [Sharon lies down] I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.

Sharon

Wull whattaya mean?

Randy

[faces Sharon] Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?

Sharon

Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.

Randy

I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.[dramatic exit music]

-----


Back to the Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming.

Minister

And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles: entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-

Prince

So they'll forget they're spending money.

Minister

 -and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.

Phillip

We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?

Minister

No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun. [the Prince gives Terrance and Phillip each a check.]

Terrance

What's this?

Prince

Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.

Terrance

So this is- Everyone is doing this?

Minister

Ehhhveryone is doing it.

Phillip

It's just the way things are going?

Minister

It's the way things are going!

Terrance

Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.

-----


Stan's bedroom, day. Stan is playing the Terrance & Phillip mobile game in bed

Terrance

[in the game] Hey Phillip! [Stan's bedroom door opens and in walk Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman]

Stan

Ohhh hey guys.

Kyle

You... missed school today?

Stan

Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.

Kyle

Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?

Stan

Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?

Cartman

How much money did you micropay today, Stan?

Stan

Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. [smiles]

Kyle

You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?

Stan

You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?

Cartman

Yes.

Stan

It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.

Kyle

Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?

Cartman

Jimmy told me about this game.

Kyle

Kenny, who told you about this game?

Kenny

(Jimmy.)

Kyle

Dude, what?!

Cartman

The?!

Kenny

(Fuck?!)

-----


A street corner in South Park, near a fast-food restaurant. Jimmy stands there with phone in hand. He spots someone.

Jimmy

Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here. [a boy crosses the street and stands next to him] Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?

Boy

What do you mean?

Jimmy

The Terrance & Phillip mobile game. [whips it out] All the cool kids are usin' it.

Boy

Aw, I don't know.

Jimmy

Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff. [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny appear at the other end of the block and spot him, then walk towards him a few seconds later] It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? [the boys reach him]

Kyle

Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?

Jimmy

Why sure fellas. [the boy turns left and walks away] Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.

Kyle

[walks up to him] Dude, what are you doing?!

Jimmy

Just hangin' out. What are you up to?

Kyle

You need to stop recommending that app to people!

Kenny

(Yeah!)

Cartman

Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!

Jimmy

I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.

Cartman

It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!

Kyle

[crosses his arms] Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!

Jimmy

[on the spot] Alright, alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.

Kyle

You just push it on other people?!

Jimmy

They pay me to!

Kyle

Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!

-----


The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. The Prince looks out over the new construction going on in the city, then turns around

Prince

You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game.

Terrance

Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.

Minister

Oh. Ah what is the matter?

Phillip

It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. [Terrance jumps up and farts on Phillip, who laughs.]

Prince

But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan.

Terrance

We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.

Minister

Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that! [gasps] Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in "moderation"?

Prince

Ohhhhh. [claps furiously]

Phillip

Do you really think that would help?

Minister

Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!

-----


Live commercial for alcohol. A montage of people enjoying alcohol and the good life that often accompanies it.

Announcer

You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK! [screen goes black with "Drink Responsibly" in white on it] Please drink responsibly.

-----


Three Feathers Casino, day. The camera pans from left to right. Randy appears in the far end of the casino and walks to the right

Randy

Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go. [Stan catches up] That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine. [they approach Marvin] Come on Dad, we're going home.

Marvin

[playing at a 25 cent Lucky Unicorn slot machine] Ah, go away.

Randy

Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!

Marvin

What are you talkin' about?

-----


The Marsh house, some time later, day. Randy is pacing the floor in front of the sofa as Stan and Marvin sit and listen

Randy

I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!

Stan

It's just...

Marvin

It's fun.

Stan

Yeah, it's fun.

Randy

It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!

Marvin

Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!

Randy

I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six! [walks up to a small buffet cabinet on which sit six different glasses of wine, from syrah to rosé] It's called a tasting, and it's classy![Marvin looks away]

Stan

Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.

Marvin

[faces forward] Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop.

Randy

All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore. [gulps down the glass of Merlot] HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*

-----


Jimmy's house. He stands by a window contemplating

Jimmy

Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman. [turns around and walks across the room] People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.

Kyle

But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!

Jimmy

How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.

Cartman

[approaches Jimmy and grabs him by the shirt collar] And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!

Jimmy

I needed the money, alright?! [Cartman releases him and he walks off a bit] I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!

Kyle

You have your crutches!

Jimmy

It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.

Cartman

That makes sense.

Kyle

You're saying these games do this on purpose?!

Jimmy

[faces the boys] Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.

-----


Stan's bedroom, night. He's awake in bed looking at the ceiling. The first notification comes in on his phone

Voice notification

Hey, buddy. Come on, guy. [Stan turns to his left side and the notification disappears, but just as he closes his eyes another one follows.] Come back, friend. You've got new buddies, guy. [Stan takes his pillow and puts it over his head. The third notification comes in] We've just given you 5000 Canadian coins. [Stan quickly looks at his phone] Enjoy your Canadough.

Stan

...Free? [puts his pillow back on the mattress, grabs the phone and starts playing again]

-----


The Marsh kitchen, day. Randy and Stan are in it

Randy

What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!

Stan

I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.

Randy

$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!

Stan

One?

Randy

Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!

Stan

No, no, it's not.

Randy

You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!

Stan

I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!

Randy

I am not chugging beer! [walks up to the breakfast table on which are eight glasses of wine and eight of beer, paired up. He's gone through four pairs already] I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! [plops the fifth lager into the fifth wine glass and chugs down the pair, then blows a whistle while shaking his head with his hands. Stan has nothing to say.]

-----


Kyle's house, day. Stan walks over to it and rings the doorbell. Kyle answers the door.

Stan

Okay, I need help. [sometime later Cartman, Kenny and Jimmy arrive, and Stan picks up where he left off. The conversation moves to the living room, and Kyle gives Stan a comforting tap on the right shoulder] There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.

Jimmy

Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?

Kyle

Sure. Come on, guys. [he, Cartman and Kyle walk away]

Jimmy

This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.

Stan

It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.

Jimmy

I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.

Stan

How?

Jimmy

What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say "I have a problem." And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. [Stan is left deep in thought]

-----


The Broflovski kitchen, at the same time. The other boys are in there waiting for Jimmy and Stan

Kyle

[brainstorming] We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-

Cartman

It's done. [he had been texting on his phone]

Kyle

Wuh, what's done?

Cartman

The word is out. [shows him the phone] "Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts." I tweeted it. [glances at his phone's screen] It's trending.

-----


The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. Terrance & Phillip burst through the doors again

Terrance

You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!

Prince

You what?

Minister

Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game.

Phillip

But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!

Terrance

You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!

Prince

Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?

Minister

Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games really work. [pulls down on the heavy rope again and new, prepared whiteboards come down over the used ones. The doors close and the room gets dim.] The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents.

Terrance

But then all our profits come from people with problems.

Minister

Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke.

Phillip

[snorts the bump] Okay, but we still won't stand for this!

-----


Stan's room, night. He's kneeling by the side of his bed, looking up at the moon. Then he gets to prayer

Stan

I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? [a bright, fiery light appears behind him and he turns to look at it. Satan emerges from it]

Satan

You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!

Stan

Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.

Satan

Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul! [moments later he's on Stan's bed, the fiery light gone] So you got dopamine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce.

Stan

Okay.

Satan

But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff.

Stan

So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?

Satan

Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopamine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.

Stan

So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?

Satan

Yeah, that's pretty much what it means.

Stan

The addict people said something about me filling a hole.

Satan

Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?

Stan

Yeah, no, this is great.

Satan

Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec.

-----


The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. The Minister continues with his lecture

Minister

Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers.

Phillip

Oh God, he just doesn't stop!

Terrance

Who IS this guy?!

Minister

We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're COUNTING on it!! It's the same with us, but we've got our eyes on every addict's screen! [the whiteboards begin to dissolve into the walls, with the words floating around independently]Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!

Phillip

Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!

Minister

Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil. [he transforms into a Canadian devil and floats up towards the ceiling] I'm the Canadian Devil. [laughs]

Terrance

Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!

Phillip

Beelzeboot!

Beelzeboot

You discovered my plan, but too late! [lets out a flaming turd] Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me!

Terrance

Oh no!

Prince

Oh, what have I done?!

Beelzeboot

Heheheh! Hahaha! [lets out a flaming turd]

-----


Stan's room, night. Satan continues his talk with Stan, this time with a small whiteboard

Satan

So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopamine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff.[puts the whiteboard aside] Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ?

Stan

I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?

Satan

You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too, so people have free will and all that shit. But ,you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay.

Voice notification

*Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?

Satan

What's this?

Stan

That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. [Satan taps the screen, stands up, and plays the game]

Satan

What, you just collect coins?

Announcer

How much money can you buy today?

Satan

No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?

Stan

Ah, Canada?

Satan

Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, "temptation has to be nuanced!" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?

Stan

...Okay. [Satan proceeds to possess Stan] Aaaaahhh!

-----


The Marsh living room, moments later. Randy and Sharon are on the sofa. Randy wears a beer hat with two cans of gluten-free PBR attached to it, one by each ear

Randy

Oh pass interference! Interference! [points at the TV. Stan walks by]

Sharon

Stan, where are you going? [Randy looks over]

Stan

[with Satan's voice] I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. [continues out the door]

Randy

Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. [Sharon looks at him]

-----


The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, under a fiery sky.

NC 9 reporter

Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil.

Beelzeboot

[flies up to the microphone] Hey, guy, I'm the Canadian Devil. [lets out a flaming turd and flies back into the Department]

NC 9 reporter

The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world. [Beelzeboot goes to torture Terrance, Phillip, and the Prince, who now hang from chains tied to the ceiling]

Beelzeboot

Heh heheheh, I stab you. [Satan, now in Stan's body, appears outside the meeting room and blows the doors off, then walks in]

Satan

Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!

Phillip

Who the fuck is that?

Beelzeboot

Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan! [lets out a flaming turd]

Satan

Return from whence you came! [purple balls of energy appear around his hands, and they produce two beams of flame which carry Beelzeboot out into the sky]

Beelzeboot

Ow! Watch it, guy! [the battle continues in the sky]

NC 9 reporter

Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton. [The Canadian Minister of Sports appears on split screen]

Minister of Sports

Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years.

Canadian

Screw that, go Canada!

Satan

Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come. [the balls of energy reappear and this time he aims the flames down at Beelzeboot. He destroys the Department in the meantime. Flaming skulls appear and go back into the pit Satan created]

-----


The neighborhood park, day. Cartman, Kenny, and Kyle play basketball there when the ground next to them opens up and a bunch of red arms lift Stan out, repairing the court just before Stan lands on it.

Kyle

Hey dude.

Stan

Hey.

Kyle

Y-you alright?

Stan

Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. [turns away and walks off the court]

Cartman

Cool.

-----


Canada. There's a huge celebration, and the Prince steps up tp the podium

Prince

My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, shitty tundra. [cheers erupt from the crowd]

-----


The Marsh dining room. Grandpa and Stan are playing a board game

Stan

I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.

Marvin

Well okay, good idea. [Stan rolls the dice]

Randy

[stops by with an ornate silver cup] What are you gaywads doin'?

Stan

We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.

Randy

Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. [takes a seat]

Stan

That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.

Randy

It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.

Stan

Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. [Marvin takes the dice and rolls them]

Randy

You guys wanna put some money on it? [Stan bangs his head on the table.]
