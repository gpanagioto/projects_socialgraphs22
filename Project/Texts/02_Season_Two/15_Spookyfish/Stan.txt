I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today. Cartman, how come you weren't in school today? What? Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve. Dude, this is creepy. Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! Wow! I don't know. I ''don't'' like it. It's spooky. Do I have to? Damn it! Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor. Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch. Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice. Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom? Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest! Why do you keep saying "hella", fatass?! Can you leave the light on, Dad? I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now. Where did it go?  Hey. Where did the shirt go?  Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom! No! AAAAAAAAH!   But-  WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm! Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-   Mom, what are you doing? Mom, do you think ''I'' killed that guy? It was the ''fish''! He says I'm next! But MOM! MMOOMM!  No, mom!  I haven't been sleeping so well. Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff? Do you think animals can be murderers, too? I haven't been sleeping well. My pet goldfish killed another random person last night. What are you doing?! Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people. What? Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!  Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease. Cartman! Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish? Do you remember ''what'' pet store? Where? That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store. Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo! It was the ''fish''!  Now we'll ''never'' know where that pet store is! Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver.   Yeah, my goldfish-. I know. Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish! I wanna return a fish. ''Yeah, dude.'' So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground? Why? We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe. Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish. I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me! Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman!  Yeah! I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night. You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman. Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.  We won, dude! Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us!  Why don't you guys take ''our'' Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.  Up yours, evil twin!  Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya.  Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe! ''Our'' Cartman would ''never'' say anything like that. You tricked us, Cartman!
