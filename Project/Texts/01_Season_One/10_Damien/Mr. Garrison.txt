 Children, children! Today is a very special day. I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today. Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate...  uh-uh, what's your name again? Say 'hi' to Damien!  And where are you from, Damien? Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama. Your father? ''Wow'', we have ''royalty'' in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era. Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass... Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? Holy poop on a stick! Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too. Wai-wa I was here first. Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too. Yeah, crazy. Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight! Yeah, what a mean thing to do! Boy, did we get screwed.
