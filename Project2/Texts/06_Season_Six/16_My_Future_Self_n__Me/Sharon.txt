 Stan, what did I tell you about watching ''The Osbournes''? It's going to make you retarded!  Who are you?  Randy, what's going on? But why are you back in this time with us, son?  That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift. You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep? Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind sharing his room, would you, Stan? It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this. Well that makes sense. Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little? Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just ''feel'' he's our son, you know? Right.   S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self. Randy!  AAAHHH! Looks like you'd better ''really'' watch out for marijuana, huh Stan? Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future. He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them. Well here, Eric, I cooked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
