Yeah-heah! You got it, Ned! That was a nice shot! Come on, let's see what we got.  Looks like a bear. A huge one! Come on, the tracks go this way.  Look at that. Looks like bear droppings. But with a man poop right next to it. What the hell are we dealing with, Ned? Whatever it is, it was heard recently.  We're trackin' a bear, Randy. Where're you goin' Ned? Jesus Christ!  Whoa! NNEEEEDDDD!!
