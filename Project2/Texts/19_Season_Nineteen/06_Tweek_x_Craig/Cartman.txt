Uh oh.  Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass? I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude? I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along. Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you. Did you do it, Cupid-Me?  That's so sweet. Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.  Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny. Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.  You guys! You guys, hurry! It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex!  Oh-ho come on, you guys. Get a room.   "Can't we just try? Tee Hee." Oh man. Someone who needs a real talking to. Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing. You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys. I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me.  What are you doing? This place isn't you.  No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now. Fuck you. The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.  I'm not homosexual! Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together. Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay?   Okay, okay, the date's almost over. It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me. Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight! Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God!
