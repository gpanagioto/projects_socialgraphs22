Oh? Does it run on electricity? Not as fat as your face! He's not your friend, guy! Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know? Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation. And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars! You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift! Maybe you can go live with the Danish! I'm not your friend, buddih!
