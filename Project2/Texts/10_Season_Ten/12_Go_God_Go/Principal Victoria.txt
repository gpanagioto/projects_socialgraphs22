Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it. Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything. Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that- Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class. It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins!  Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist. You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs! Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom. Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
