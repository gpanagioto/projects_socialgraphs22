Episode starts with Cartman watching TV and snacking on something. Kitty walks up.

Kitty

Meow.

Cartman

No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!

Kitty

Meow.

Cartman

No, Kitty! [the TV screen shows a blond Ash-like figure surrounded by three little monsters]

"Ash"

Someday, I will collect all the Chinpokomon, then I will fight the Evil Power that will reveal itself once all the Chinpokomon are collectable, [tilts his head to one side] oh?

Kitty

Meow?

Cartman

[affecting an anime look] No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?

Announcer

Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of... Chinpokomon.

Cartman

[exults] Hooray! [hops off the sofa and begins to walk away...]

Announcer

Hey kids! [Cartman turns to look at the TV] Do you love Chinpokomon?

Cartman

Yes.

Announcer

Well, now you can buy your very own! [the little monsters begin to flash across the screen]

Singer


I got to buy ChinpokomonI got to buy it, I got to buy it! [six Chinpokomon appear]



Announcer

[more Chinpokomon appear...] Now you can collect them all. Furrycat, Donkeytron, Pengin, Shoe, Lambtor. Collect them all, and you can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.

Cartman

Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!

Announcer

All the Chinpokomon are in stores now.

Japanese Woman

[dressed in business attire] Chinpokomon is soo-peh-rior rubbeh toy, Nuhmbah 1!

Singer


I got to buy it! Chinpo-ko-mon!



Cartman

[turns off TV and rushes to the kitchen, tossing the chicken tenders away] Mom! Mom!

+++++


Kitchen. Liane is at the sink. Cartman rushes in and runs circles around her legs.

Cartman

[pants] Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!

Liane

Eric, calm down. [genuflects and restrains him]

Cartman

Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!

Liane

What is it, Eric?

Cartman

[breathless] Mom-Mom! I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store!

Liane

[stands up and turns to the counter] I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.

Cartman

[stops] ...But Mom, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.

Liane

Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?

Cartman

[shriek] ...But Mom, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!

Liane

Alright! let's go. [heads towards the front door. Cartman follows]

Cartman

Sweet.

+++++


Toy store, "TOYS." Cartman and Liane approach it.

Cartman

Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. [Liane opens the door, and both are shocked to find the store full of kids looking around and walking with Chinpokomon dolls. The class is there...]

Boy

Wuh-I love Chinpokomon.

Girl

[amid the din] Give it to me!

Boy

Give it here!

Louis

[fighting with Bradley Biggle over a Chinpokomon doll] Give me that!

Cartman

Oh, god damnit! [walks in and runs into Stan]

Stan

Hey, fatass.

Cartman

Hey, dickhole. I guess you saw the commercial, too.

Stan

Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.

Cartman

Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the cutest. [walks to the Pengin canister and finds it empty] God damnit, there's no more Pengins! [Kenny walks over with one] Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. [starts pulling]

Kenny

(Nuh uh.) [pulls back. Tug-of-war]

Cartman

C'mon.

Kenny

(Nuh uh!)

Cartman

C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--

Kenny

(No!)

Cartman

C'mon.

Kenny

(No!)

Cartman

C'mon. Give me Pengin!

Kenny

(No! This is mine!)

Cartman

C'mon!

+++++


Checkout counter. Sharon is ready to pay for some Chinpokomon. Liane has one, too. Sharon turns to Liane.

Sharon

Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.

Liane

They're so strange. Where are they from?

Cashier

Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids.

"Ash"

[on a TV screen] I've got to collect all Chinpokomon. I've got to collect them all so I can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master, oooh? [static]

Japanese woman

Own-ah Chinpokomon, and-ah you vill-ah have-ah happy feelings-eh. [static]

"Ash"

I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.

Kids

[recite as they disperse] Must collect Chinpokomon.

+++++


South Park, next day. The boys stand around with their Chinpokomon. Kyle is missing.

Cartman

Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.

Kenny

(Fuck you!)

Cartman

God damn it, you're supposed to trade, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!

Kyle

[arrives at the bus stop] Hey dudes. [notices] What are those?

Stan

What are these? They're Chinpokomon!

Kyle

Huh?

Cartman

[haltingly] You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon?

Kyle

No, but look. I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.

Cartman

Oh, please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.

Stan

Yeah, like ancient history.

Kyle

Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?

Stan

No, dude!

Cartman

Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.

Kyle

Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!

Cartman

It's all Chinpokomon now.

Stan

Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.

Kyle

What's the Primary Main Objective?

Cartman

You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?

Stan

The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.

Kyle

Well, what's the Evil Power?

Stan

[exasperated] Ogh..!

Cartman

[exasperated] Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!

Kyle

What?

Cartman

Duhhh!

Stan

Yeah, get with the times, dude. [turns and walks away with Cartman and Kenny]

Cartman

Duhhh!

Kyle

[throws down Cyborg Bill] Shit!

+++++


Broflovski residence. Sheila and Gerald are talking on the sofa. Ike sits to Gerald's left.

Gerald

Yeah, I guess so.

Kyle

[enters] Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?

Sheila

What's a Chinpokomon?

Kyle

I'm not sure.

Sheila

Well, why do you need one?

Kyle

I don't know.

Sheila

...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.

Kyle

Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.

Gerald

Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.

Ike

Neah Kyle doh.

Gerald

You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?

Kyle

Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.

Gerald

Hm... Good point; here's $10. [hands it to him]

Kyle

Thanks.

Gerald

Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. [Kyle receives the other $10 and walks out]

Ike

Hey, Chih-paw-ko.

+++++


Toy store. Kyle has just purchased a Lambtor.

Cashier

[hands him the doll] There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things.

Kyle

Neither do I. [turns and walks out.]

Cashier

[closes the door and turns off the lights] I guess I'll call it a night. [heads towards the back]

A voice

Chinpoko! [the cashier turns] Buy me! Buy me! [the cashier heads for the Chinpokomon display] When will you become Royal Chinpoko Master? [the cashier gets a Lambtor and squeezes it, making a little squeak.] Hurry up and buy me. [squeeze] Down with America!

Cashier

What? [squeeze]

Lambtron

I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government.

Cashier

What the hell is goin' on here?

+++++


Cartman residence, next day. The boys are engaged in a video game. Again, Kyle is absent.

Kyle

[enters] Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!

Cartman

Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.

Kyle

What?

Stan

Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?

Kyle

[a little lost] Huh? No.

Cartman

[haltingly] Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! [Cartman presses "START" on game controller]

Announcer

Chinpokomon, what is Primary Objective?

Stan/Kenny/ Cartman

To destroy the Evil Power!

"Ash"

I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh?

Stan/Kenny/ Cartman

Oooh?

Kyle

Damnit! [walks out]

"Ash"

I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor.

Japanese woman

[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! Deddy? [vanishes]

"Ash"

Go! ["GO" pops up, and the boys are furiously maneuvering their controllers]

Kenny

(Hey, you guys...) [the boys bomb the harbor, grunting all the while]

"Ash"

I must buy them all! I must buy them all!

Stan/Kenny/ Cartman

We must buy them all! [they finish the first round of bombing and fly away]

Japanese woman

[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! [drops down. The second round begins and the bombing is more intense. Kenny begins to convulse and finally drops off the sofa. Play stops as Cartman and Stan look on with shock]

Stan

Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!

Cartman

Cool! This game rules!

+++++


Japan; Chinpokomon Company, outside. An inside shot looks to the main doors as they open, and one man walks in.

Cashier

Hello-o? Ey, hello? [a monitor drops down from above]

Japanese woman

[on screen] Werucome to Chinpokomon Toy Corporashon. Purease state a-name.

Cashier

Rr-Red Harris? I own a toy store in America?

Japanese woman

Purease state the puhpose-uh.

Red

Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all? [the monitor is pulled up in a hurry, and an elevator rises from the floor. The doors open and two men walk towards him.]

Taller man

I am President Hirohito. And-ah, this is Mr. Ose.

Mr. Ose

[nods forward] Peased to meet you.

President Hirohito

We unduhstand you have big concern about our fine pro-duct.

Red

Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about? [squeezes Lambtor]

Lambtor

The American government lies to you! Join the fight for Japanese supremacy of the world! More to come. [the two men remain silent]

Red

Well?

Mr. Ose

Uuuh.

President Hirohito

That is so sturange. [takes Lambtor from Red] I do not a-know how this could happen. But urest assured, I will make sure [glares sideways at Mr. Ose] it does not happong again!

Red

Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--

President Hirohito

You are American?

Red

Yes.

President Hirohito

[begins to gesture] Ogh! You must have very big pee-anis!

Red

Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!

President Hirohito

Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.

Mr. Ose

[fakes a sob] Uh, smuh, so small.

President Hirohito

We cannot achieve much with so small penis. But you! Americans. Wow! Penis so big! Soo big penis!

Red

[flattered] Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size.

Mr. Ose

Minna-san, kite kite! ["Everyone, come come!" A group of Japanese women move in, chattering] This-a man has veh-ry big penis! [the women applaud, Red grins big]

Woman 1

Take takeru o da ne? ["It's rather large, isn't it?"]

Woman 2

Hai. ["Yes."]

Mr. Ose

Uh, hoh, what an-whoa immense penis-uh!

Red

Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now.

President Hirohito

Good-bye. Thank you for stopping by, with your gargantuan penis. [Red walks out humming happily. After a moment Hirohito looks angrily at Mr. Ose] Dame, dame da. ["Its over. Its all over." The women quickly exit the room. He slaps the back of Mr. Ose's head] Naze kono chippu o soto wo detanda? ["Why did you let this chip get outside?"]

Mr. Ose

Wa, wakarimasen, shachou-san. Mondai desu ne. ["I, I don't know, president. This is going to be a problem, isn't it?"]

President Hirohito

Seki ni shou yoube! ["Prepare a sit down meeting!"]

Mr. Ose

Hai. Hai, shachou-san. ["Yes. Yes, president." He bows out]

+++++


The Cartman house, night. Kitty roars outside. Cartman is asleep, but tossing...

Cartman

I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...

+++++


His Chinpokomon sends up an antenna, which sends out a signal, which goes out the window and joins other signals at a point in space. Then the merged signals go to a satellite, which bounces them to Japan. The signals reach the Chinpokomon Toy Corporation's rooftop satellite dish and split up to show each Chinpokomon in its own screen on the company's video wall. President Hirohito is talking to his board of directors under heavy guard.

President Hirohito

Amerika no kodomo minna ga Chinpokomon mo motte ima na. "Phase two" kaishi suru toki da. IKIMASHOO! ["All the children in America already own Chinpokomon now. It is time to begin "Phase two" . LET'S GO!" The soldiers set their rifles] The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!

+++++


Marsh residence, next day. A TV is on: "I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon!" Sharon sits on the sofa looking at the cartoon.

Randy

[walks up] What are you doing?

Sharon

I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.

Randy

Why?

Sharon

Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. [Randy sits]

"Ash"

[addressing a robot rooster] Hey, you must be Roostor! I haven't bought one of you yet, but I'll bet you can transform into Roostallion if you found Diamond Skill 7! [picks it up and squeezes]

Roostor

Roo-oo-oostor! [a teen boy in black body suit emblazoned with an 8 appear]

"Eight"

[does the following as he speaks] Hey, I'm gonna take your Roostor and put it in this bag, where it will flourish or expire, depending on fate!

"Ash"

Hey! Is that a good idea?

"Eight"

Roostors aren't like Chuchunezumis. They haven't the heart for such endeavors.

"Ash"

Oooh? [Randy and Sharon look lost]

Randy

...Are those good moral values?

Sharon

I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

+++++


Hours later. Randy and Sharon watch a battle scene in disbelief.

"Ash"

Lambtron! You are losing the battle of your life! [Lambtron battles Furrycat]

Narrator

But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?

"Ash"

I am sad now, because Lambtron must be very lonely because there are so few Lambtrons in the world. Will he ever find a companion?

Sharon

This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?

Randy

I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.

Sharon

Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!

Randy

Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.

Sharon

No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.

Randy

[solemnly] My God, you're right.

+++++


South Park, by Tom's Rhinoplasty, day. Cartman is strumming a guitar. A sign on the case reads: "Please HELP...Boys Sent to camp".

Cartman


Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and...



Stan

[arrives with Kenny] How's it goin', fat ass?

Cartman

I haven't made any money yet.

Stan

What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?

Cartman

Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!

Stan

We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. [moves Kenny so the glazed eyes can be seen]

Kyle

[rushes up with a new item] I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! [Tthe others look at him and then laugh]

Cartman

Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!

Stan

Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.

Kyle

Camp?

Cartman

[sighs] The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.

Stan

You didn't know that?

Kyle

[quickly saving face] No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? [turns and walks away]

Stan

Dude, did you just say "a-ight"?

Kyle

[turns back] Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?

Cartman

Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!

Stan

Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore.

Kyle

What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?

Cartman

Like, eight days ago.

Kyle

God damnit! [turns and hurries away]

+++++


Marsh residence, night. Living room. The Marshes, the Broflovskis, Liane, the McCormicks, and the Tweeks watch an Chinpokomon advertisement.

Announcer

Hey, kids! [Furrycat appears] Only one more day till the Chinpokomon camp! ["Ash" and "Eight" appear] Come early and enjoy all the Chinpoko fun! ["Chinpokomon CAMP" is placed over Furrycat, then a violet gorilla appears]

Singer


Chinpokomon Camp!I've got to buy a ticket!I've got to buy one! A ticket!I've got to buy buy buy!



Japanese woman

[pops in from the side] It'sa Satuhday anda Sunday. You can'ta wait to go! [moves out]

Singer


Chinpokomon! [the TV clicks off]



Sharon

We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.

Liane

Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.

Sheila

Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.

Randy

[concerned] Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.

Sheila

Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.

Sharon

You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.

Sheila

Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?

+++++


Chinpokomon camp. A huge temple looms over the crowd of kids. Three huge screens display the Chinpokomon program. Soldiers guard the screens and the central stairway. Stan and friends move through the crowd. Several classmates are already there.

Cartman

Get outta the way! Move it!

Stan

Can you see anything? [the gorilla Chinpokomon appears onscreen]

Kids

Yay!!! [applause]

Stan

It's starting, it's starting!

Singer


I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon! [the kids continue to cheer and clap. Mr. Ose takes center stage]



Mr. Ose

Attention! Attention! [the kids quiet down] This isa Chinpokomon Camp!

Kids

Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!

Kyle

...our hearts. [looks left] Kenny? [Kenny stands motionless]

Mr. Ose

What is the Primary Main Objective?

Kids

To destroy the Evil Power!

Kyle

...Power.

Mr. Ose

Yesuh. Anda what is the Evil Power? [no one answers] The Evil Power is the United States gorvernment! [the three screens display the U.S. flag. The kids stay silent]

Cartman

Ohhh.

Mr. Ose

United Statesuh government is the Evil Power! It hasa taken Japanese Americans! It hasa broken Japanese spirit! And what do Chinpoko Masters do to Evil Power?!

Kids

Destroy it!

Kyle

Destroy it?

Mr. Ose

That isa correct! Now, it isa great honor to present... your Chinpoko Leaduh! Emperor Hirohito! [a gong is heard, and Mr. Ose claps a few times]

Emperor Hirohito

[President Hirohito in shogun attire takes center stage] Welcome to campu. Whoever passes it knows and honors that the greatness of Japan is in its history, and it is based on that history that we shall again rise to the dominant world powuh!

Cartman

Is this cool or not? I can't tell.

Emperor Hirohito

It is again time for the Rising Sun to sit tall in the sight! One Japan! One society! [walks off. Mr. Ose claps and takes the mike]

Mr. Ose

We will begin witha language anda exercise skills. Hajimete!! ["Begin!" Two instructors walk up]

Instructors

Kids

+++++


South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class. The kids are chatting away happily in Japanese. All have anime expressions.

Mr. Garrison

Okay, children, I want it quiet! [the class shuts up] Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three?

Stan

Juuhachi desu ka? ["Isn't it eighteen?"]

Class

Juuhachi da nee! ["Eighteen it is!"]

Mr. Garrison

No, goddammit, it's eighteen!!

Stan

Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.

Mr. Garrison

For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!

Cartman

Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. ["Ooo, Mr. Garrison is such an asshole!"]

Mr. Garrison

What did he say?!

Stan

He said, "Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."

Class

Soo desu nee! ["That's right!"]

Mr. Garrison

Damnit, this is not Japan!!

Cartman

Minna-san! Kite kite, churi... [farts. The class laughs]

Wendy

Dare ga pu shita no. ["Who farted?"]

Mr. Garrison

Aggghhh! [rushes out of the room amid the kids' laughter]

City Hall, the Mayor's Office. The parents are gathered in it.

Mayor

People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...

Mr. Garrison

I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.

Sharon

[Randy holds her] My son hasn't made any sense in days.

Priest Maxi

I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!

Mayor

Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? [Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose step up]

President Hirohito

We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.

Randy

Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!

President Hirohito

There is nothing to worry about. We at Japan Toy Company are in awe of your large penis.

Mr. Garrison

What?

President Hirohito

You see, Japanese penis so small. [holds his hands about an inch apart]

Mr. Ose

[set his index finger an inch from his thumb] So-eh small.

President Hirohito

You Americans have such humungous burbous penis.

Mr. Garrison

Well, uh-I guess that's true.

Mr. Ose

Oh, suh-n nice-a big penis American.

President Hirohito

What can we possubruh do with such small penis? We cannot take over your city, filled witha men awith such mastodonic penis.

Jimbo

Huwell, uh he's got a point there.

Randy

Well, I guess that settles that.

Priest Maxi

We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen.

President Hirohito

[bowing with Mr. Ose] Oh, no. Thank you. Another chance to be in same room with big American penis. [exits]

Mr. Ose

Uh-uh, my penis so small. [exits]

Priest Maxi

Nice guys. [the door closes]

+++++


City Hall, outside the Mayor's Office.

President Hirohito

Jikan ga nai. Sugu ni bara de shimaou. Shikashi, itsu baru shinkuro isoga reba. ["Time is short. Those people will discover our plan soon. We must finish quickly."]

+++++


City Hall, the Mayor's Office. The men and women have split into two groups by gender. Sharon speaks.

Sharon

So, what are we going to do about our children? [the men smile down at their crotches] Ahhh, hello-o?

Mayor

O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.

Liane

You have?

Mayor

Children are fickle. [thump] All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.

Sharon

Of course! That's a great idea!

Sheila

But what toy?

+++++


South Park Market Research Laboratories, a nondescrpt building. A big-screen TV is shown, flanked by two lab techs. Then a sofa is shown, with Kyle, Stan, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters.

Lab Tech 1

Alright, boys, we're going to show you a couple of commercials, and you tell us which toy interests you the most. Now, watch carefully. [the first one comes on]

Announcer

Hey, kids. Do you like Chinpokomon?

Boys

Yeah!

Announcer

Well then, you're gonna go wild for [echo comes on as a weird bike is shown] Wild Wacky Action Bike! [a bike with two single-arm handles, one attached to each wheel, and two lumpy side wheels]

Singer


Wild Wacky Action Bike!The bike that's hard to ride!



Announcer

[a boy runs to the bike and hops on, trying to figure out how to steer it. He shrugs] Wild Wacky Action Bike is almost impossible to steer. And it glows in the dark.

Singer


Goin' to try to ride all day long, but I'm goin' to fail'Cause it's Wild Wacky Action Bike!



Boy

[manages to steer it, but runs into some cones] Man... [then steers it well enough down the street]

Singer

Announcer

Wild Wacky Action Bike comes with everything you see here. [the boys say nothing for a while, then...]

Cartman

Stan

Yeah, dude. That was totally gay.

Lab Tech 1

No, it's not okay!

Mr. Ose

Oh, but-a you have-a such large penis-uh. [behind him, Stan has a fierce expression on his face]

Sharon

What?

Mr. Ose

Your penis, wooww-- [President Hirohito walks up and slaps him] O-oh..!

President Hirohito

What he means is that all men in this town have very large penis. [all the men smile at the compliment]

Sharon

Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!

President Hirohito

Misenasai! ["Show them!" Mr. Ose takes down his pants. The people are shocked, and he pulls them up again.]

Sheila

How?

Sharon

Come on! We don't have much time! [leads the adults away]

Washington, D.C.; the White House.

Reporter

And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States.

President Clinton

[from the Oval Office] My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.

+++++


A Japanese military base. Eighteen planes and 39 troops are seen. The kids stand at attention. Kyle is missing.

Mr. Ose

Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!

Kids

Hai, shachou-san. ["Yes, Mr. President." The kids part to the planes. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny run into the adults]

Stan

Nan da kore? ["What's this?"]

Randy

Chinpoko ga dai-suki yo! ["We're crazy about this Chinpoko stuff." All the adults carry Chinpokomon now]

Stan

What?

Randy

Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!

Stan

You like it?

Mr. Garrison

You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.

Liane

Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.

Cartman

Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.

President Hirohito

Whar are they doing?!

Mr. Ose

It's a trick!

Randy

Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker. ["MY KID IS A CHINPOKOKID" with a smiling kid's face on the left end, and a Lambtron on the right. Randy walks to it and kneels to display it] Isn't that cool?

Stan

[holding a Chuchunezumi] No. [the adults laugh, and he throws the Chuchunezumi away] Screw this, dude. [starts walking out]

Cartman

Where are you going, Stan?

Stan

Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. [walks away]

Cartman

Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. [follows]

Other kids

Yeah. Me too! Me too. [each one tosses a Chinpokomon onto a pile and leaves the airfield. A Lambtron lands on its side and a kid steps on it. The adults cheer.]

President Hirohito

[grabbing his head in frustrated disbelief] Nooo!!

Randy

Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.

Sharon

That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool. [turns to Mr. Garrison] We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! [he walks over to a telegraph machine and starts spreading the word]

Stan

Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?

Sharon

You bet, Stanley! [a fighter plane has left its spot and appears before the crowd. Kyle is in the cockpit]

Kyle

Owatta Beikoku! ["Down with the U.S.A.!"] [the adults are stunned]

Sheila

Kyle, it's over!

Kyle

But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!

Stan

[flatly] Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.

Kyle

What?

Cartman

Yeah, dude, that's way over. [a rat is on Kenny, trying to nibble]

Kyle

Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!

Stan

No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.

Kyle

So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?

Stan

...Ye-eah.

Kyle

But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. [moves forward]

Stan

Oh... Wait. [walks with the plane] Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.

Kyle

Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. [turns the power off and hops out of the plane. Mr. Garrison walk away]

Randy

Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.

Cartman

[sees rats on Kenny and swats them off] Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!

+++++


Bus Stop, next day. The four boys are waiting. The rats return and crawl all over Kenny.

Cartman

Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!

Stan

Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?

Kyle

Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.

Cartman

Me, too. [Kenny starts to tremble] I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- [Kenny falls and trembles harder. The others watch]

Stan

What the..? [Kenny's body rips open and a bunch of rats crawl out of him.]

Cartman

Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! [Stan and Kyle laugh as Cartman looks on, the credits play the instrumental theme that played in the Wild Wacky Action Bike & Alabama Man commercials]
