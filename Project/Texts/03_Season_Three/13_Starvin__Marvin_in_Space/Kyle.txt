No it wasn't, fatass! I saw ''you'' do it! Relax, fatass. You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls! Cartman! Good job, fatass! Why would ''anybody'' send this asshole money?  Yeh-hah.  Starvin' Marvin! He ''did'' take a ship. I think he wants us to get in. Let's go somewhere.  Yes! No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too. Oh, my God! What the hell is ''that'' thing?!   Where are we? This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.  Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar. Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'. Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there.  Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do! No!  Oh, no, dude!  I ''told'' you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass! Watch out! Here I come! Kenny! Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home! What was that?  Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar. Well, how'd we do it last time?? Which button did you press, Cartman?? You don't remember?! Yeah, now finish 'em off!  Where did ''that'' come from?? Sorry, Marvin. We tried. It's pulling us in!  Marvin...   Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for ''their'' marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars. Thanks. No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
