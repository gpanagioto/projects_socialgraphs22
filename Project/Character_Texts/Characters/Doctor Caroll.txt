Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?  This says you had a birthday recently? Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes. It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear.  What's that sound like to you? Aha. Now I'm going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan.  Wait, this sounds like shit to you? Well that's very strange.  Look at these two pictures. One of them is an ad for Kevin James' new movie ''The Zookeeper'', and the other is a turd in a microwave. Which one is the ad for ''The Zookeeper''? You don't see any difference in the pictures?  that is a turd about to be reheated. Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called "being a cynical asshole."
