Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny. Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!  Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this? I'll give you ten bucks to eat it. Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!  What's the matter? Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it.  Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny? I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke. That's 19 bucks, Kenny!  Kick ass, dude! Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff. Whoa!  What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months. Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman. Good point.  Huh? Why not? I don't know. Why? Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you?  Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough? Six hours. Great. For what? Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!  He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll ''never'' see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus. ...Alright, that does it!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all! Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great. Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time! Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
