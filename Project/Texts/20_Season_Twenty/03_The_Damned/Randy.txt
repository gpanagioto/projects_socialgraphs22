Stan?  You can't just stay in your room all day.  Everyone's divided. Nobody's getting along. And there's people like your MOTHER who are thinking of voting for a DOUCHE because she doesn't have a BRAIN. I don't know what's wrong with people in this town. More and more are agreeing with your mother. I tried getting on community message boards and swaying people's minds but... it always ends up with some asshole talking about vaginas and photoshopping a dick in my mouth. That's where we're at today. Everything sucks. Okay, what?! The fuck?! Is wrong with you people?! I just saw a new poll that says more and more of you are thinking about voting for that douche! 	You're tellin' me that after that debate, you still wanna vote for that guy?! Did you see the same debate I saw?! 	 I agree. 	Shit, I'm startin' to really like this guy. I was wrong, Stephen, I'm votin' for your guy. 	It's just...  I see what you mean. He talks like an ordinary person. And he has a lot of the same emotions I do, you know? He's got my vote. 	 What? You were just voting for him yesterday! What happened?? What the hell is wrong with people?! You just don't flip back and forth like that?!  ...I did. What's going on, Stephen? Why does everything suck this hard? But how did we get here? Completely confused and with shit for choices? It's like... it's like there are other forces at work.   Yeah, I have some questions about uh member berries? Oh my God, there's this many?
