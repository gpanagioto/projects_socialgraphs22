Oh, shut up!  It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead. Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu...  Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark.  I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone! I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya! All right, damn you! The children can come in! It's still here, ih... it's all still here. No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.
