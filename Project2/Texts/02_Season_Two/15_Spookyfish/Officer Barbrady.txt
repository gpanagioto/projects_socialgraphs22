Well, there's been a report of a few missing people. Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them.  No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though? Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?   Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions. Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then. Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor. No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.
