Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner? Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic? I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain. Do you mean that? How do we fix this, doctor? We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore. Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home! Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
