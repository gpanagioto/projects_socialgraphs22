Whoa, bummer, dude. Are you sure? I haven't seen it.  You guys! Hey you guys! You guys! Awesome! Give me mine!  Well yeah, dude. Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip! I think this new guy's funny. Aw, dude, gay! Racist!  Don't talk to us, kid. Kenny's a random slut.  Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there!  Weak. Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents! Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies. We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to ''us''. Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie! Alright!  Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
