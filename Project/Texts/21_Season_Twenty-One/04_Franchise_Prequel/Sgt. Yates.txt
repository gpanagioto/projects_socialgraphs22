Alright, alright, everyone calm down! I can't hear over all of you.  Alright, everyone, I just want to know one thing. Who invited him here?  Huh? What's that? Uh huh, that's what I thought. You all brought Mark Zuckerberg into your lives and now you want the police to shoot him. Well that doesn't mean he's done anything illegal. Now, the police will help deal with Mark Zuckerberg, but we aren't going to shoot him. I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. You all should've thought harder about this before letting him into your lives.
