That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.  ...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.  We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can. Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.
