Uh oh, this isn't good.  No ma'am. Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend. Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay? We don't? Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that. That's it, that's the whole story? You guys, school starts in ten minutes!  You didn't finish your essay either, right? Again? These guys are pretty good.
