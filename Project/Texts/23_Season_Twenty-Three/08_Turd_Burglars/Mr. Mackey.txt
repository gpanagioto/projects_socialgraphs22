Boys, I brought you in here because some rumors are floatin' around the school, m'kay? These rumors are that you three somehow stole feces from Kyle's mom, m'kay, and gave it to Mrs. Biggle in return for "Jedi: Fallen Order." M'kay, well someone in this school is a little turd burglar, and I want some answers! It must be hard, having to take turns playing "Jedi: Fallen Order." It's a single-player game, I believe. Oh. Because... I could get you each your own copy. That would be a lot of fun, wouldn't it? You guys stole the poop. Could you do it again? Not Kyle's mom's. Someone else's. [thinking, "The spice. I must have it. The spice m√©lange."]
