Oh jeez! Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true? That you hate Smurfs? Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!  It is true! What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch. Hey Eric! Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything. Cool, thanks.   Yeah, and she hates Smurfs! Whoa...  That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with! We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger! I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  Let us not forget what happens this day! We are here, Wendy Testaburger!  I am. The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide! Wah!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements! Ohhh, he's got her now! She's speechless! All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
