 Nay, come, again. How does the queen? O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.  Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act,  ...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh.
