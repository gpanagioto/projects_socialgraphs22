Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot? Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon. Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night? That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot? Aw, that's just adorable. Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are ''really'' getting along great. Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.  Excuse me, I didn't catch that. Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited. Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged, you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
