South Park Elementary School Cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are at the center table once again, with the girls off to screen right. This time there are ten boys present, five on each side. On the left are Butters, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny. On the right are Clyde, Craig, Jimmy, Tolkien, and Jason

Cartman

Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. [Kenny indeed has a plain bologna sandwich and a glass of water.]

Butters

Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.

Kyle

What's High School Musical 3?

Clyde

You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.

Stan

What's High School Musical 1 and 2?

Cartman

There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!

Jason

What's High School Musical 1 and... Dude, it's only the most popular thing with kids in our age group!

Jimmy

Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?

Craig

Peru.

-----


At the table behind the second row of boys, the girls begin to laugh

Bebe

And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.

Millie

Bridon Gueermo? Oh, he's such a dream!

Red

I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.

Wendy

That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. [stands on the bench in place and sings]

Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! [the girls begin to snap their fingers]



Bebe


As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.



Girls' Table


That's what bein' friends is about.
[Cue full instrumentation]
(Oh ye-ah)
[the girls stand on the benches and face the boys]
Everyone is special in their own way, and we'll always be together as one.




Cartman

[puzzled] What the hell are they doing?

Girls' Table

- Together as one -

Stan

I have no idea. [the other boys turn in their seats to get a better view]

Girls' Table


As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way.



Cartman

Dude, girls are such fags. [suddenly, Clyde, Craig, Jimmy, Tolkien, and Jason leave the table and join the girls]

Boys' table except for The Boys


Oh yeah, oh yeah!



Boys:

[Dancing] 
Boys... are special in their own way.



Girls:

[Dancing] 
Girls... are special like a birthday.



Kids:


We'll always be dancin' and singin' aloud. Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh!



Heidi


Here he comes.

 [the kids make way for a new boy, Bridon Gueermo, who dances towards the camera]

Bridon Gueermo


I like havin' fun in the hot summer sun (wooo!)
An' groovin' to the beat when my homework is all done. (yeah!)
If you ask me what I know, then you know what I will say?
That every single body is special in their own way.



Stan

[while the boy is singing] Who the hell is that?

Butters

Why that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.

Bebe

[swooning, walks over to the boys] He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.

Kids


Everyone is special in their own way



Bridon


Special in their own way!



Kids:


Move to the beat and let your spirit out!



Bridon


Let it out! Party people!



Kids


As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about.



Kyle

Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?

Stan

Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...

-----


Stan's house. The boys are watching High School Musical. They're watching a musical sequence with all singing and dancing on tables and up and downstairs. It's quite an elaborate presentation

Singers


You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!

That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-



-----


During this number, the following conversation takes place. At first, the boys are silently watching the TV, then

Cartman

This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. [silence follows for a few seconds, then Stan holds up the DVD case]

Stan

Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.

Kyle

They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.

Cartman

Well, I'm out guys. [get up from the sofa, puts on his jacket, and heads for the front door] If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.

Stan

I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.

Kyle

I'm not doing it either. Kenny?

Kenny

(No way in hell I'm doing it.)

Stan

All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. [holds up his right hand. Kyle holds his right hand up as well, and Kenny holds up his left]

Kyle

I swear

Kenny

(I swear too.)

Stan

Okay, good.

-----


South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. Kids begin taking their seats. Stan is writing something as Cartman comes in and sits down

Cartman

Ehhhhhhh. [Stan stops writing]

Kyle

What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.

Cartman

I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.

Stan

But you didn't die?

Cartman

...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. [The bell rings and Mr. Garrison walks in with his books]

Mr. Garrison

All right, kids in seats, kids in seats. [the last few kids take their seats] Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall. [He writes "Berlin Wall" on the chalkboard] This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.

Wendy


stands up on the seat of her desk] East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. [some kids begin to snap their fingers



Bebe


As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.



Kyle

Aw man.

Class


Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat



Mr. Garrison

[beaming] Oh, you kids. [Stan buries his face in his hand]</poem>

Class


Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.



Bridon


[enters the classroom]  East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.



Wendy


We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair.

 [Stan looks at them both and begins to worry that Bridon might sweep her away]

Bridon, Wendy


Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.



Class


East siiide, west siiide, east siiide...



Cartman:

[looking around and getting pissed off] God this sucks!

-----


The hallway, later on. Wendy's at her locker putting some books away. Stan is far enough away that she doesn't notice him, but he's watching her. Jimmy walks up to him

Jimmy

Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?

Stan

I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.

Jimmy

M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel.
Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-



Stan

Stop. [holds his left hand out, palm out, for emphasis, and walks away. Jimmy stops singing]

Jimmy

All righty then.

Stan

[walks up to Wendy] Uh, Wendy?

Wendy

[looks at him] Hey Stan.

Stan

Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.

Wendy

What?

Stan

I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.

Wendy

Stan, that's ridiculous.

Stan

It is?

Wendy

I would never leave you for Bridon.

Stan

[brightens up] Really?

Wendy

No way. That's stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. [shuts her locker and walks away, kissing Stan on the left cheek. Jimmy arrives two seconds later]

Jimmy

There you go. Feel better, p-pal? [Stan stays quiet]

-----


Stan walks through some double doors and continues down the hallway. The doors close behind him

Stan

What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away. [at an intersection he takes a left turn] I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him. [kids appear behind him and follow him] But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse? [noticing the finger-snapping, he stops walking and looks around. The kids wait for him to start singing and dancing] No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!

Kids

Awww. [murmurs follow]

Stan

No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.

Kids

Awww. [more murmuring. As they disperse, Butters walks up to Stan]

Butters

Awww jeez, you're no fun. [turns right and walks away. At the other end of the hall, Bridon rounds a corner and dances down the hallway in Stan's direction]

Bebe

Hey Bridon.

Bridon

Hey.

Lola

Hi Bridon

Bridon

Hi.

Heidi, Millie

Hey Bridon.

Bridon

Hey.

Stan

[now hiding behind a corner. Bridon passes by him unaware] Hey, kid, over here. [Bridon looks around and finds Stan, then walks over to him] Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.

Bridon

Huh?

Stan

Yeah, look, I-I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.

Bridon

They are?

Stan

Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me, [gets stern] you're driving everyone crazy.

Bridon

I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.

Stan

You don't like doing it?

Bridon

It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.

Stan

Basketball?

Bridon

I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.

Stan

Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!

Bridon

I can't.

Stan

[firmly] Yes, you can. What's stopping you?

Bridon

[sighs deeply] It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.

Stan

No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!

Bridon

Really?

Stan

When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.

Bridon

You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. [walks away]

Stan

[proud of himself] Sweet.

-----


Bridon's house, night. He's seated at the table for dinner. His mom enters the dining room with the main dish, a casserole. The dining room is lined with posters from various musicals - Phantom of the Opera, Mamma Mia... Felines. A full-length mirror is also present

Mrs. Gueermo

Sit up properly, Bridon. You know how strict your father is about posture. [serves out the casserole] All right dear, dinner's ready!

Mr. Gueermo

[struts in, checks himself out in the mirror, and takes his seat at the head of the table] Okay, let's eat!

Bridon

Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.

Mr. Gueermo:

Ooo, that sounds emotional! [holds his hand against his ear to listen better] 
What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time.



Bridon

No, Dad, can we just talk?

Mr. Gueermo


If you can talk it, you can sing it. [gets up and dances to the mirror again] You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-



Bridon

Dad, I want to join the basketball team. [his Dad is upset. He turns around and faces Bridon]

Mr. Gueermo

What did you say?

Bridon

This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.

Mr. Gueermo

Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!

Bridon

But Dad, it's what I really want.

Mr. Gueermo

There's no singing and dancing in basketball!

Bridon

I know. That's kind of why I like it.

Mr. Gueermo

Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club.

Bridon

It's my life, Dad!

Mr. Gueermo

Don't make me slap you! [raises his right hand, ready to slap] I will slap your face so super hard... [Bridon quickly leaves the table and his dad sits back down] I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!

Mrs. Gueermo

Maybe you should let him try it.

Mr. Gueermo

What did you say, woman?!

Mrs. Gueermo

You aren't being fair.

Mr. Gueermo

That's it! I'm gonna slap you!

Mrs. Gueermo

No, please.

Mr. Gueermo

[begins to sing and slap] 
I slap you!



Mrs. Gueermo

Ahh!

Mr. Gueermo


I slap you!



Mrs. Gueermo

Ohh!

Mr. Gueermo


I slap, slap, slap you!



Mrs. Gueermo

Dohh!

Mr. Gueermo


Slapping you, slapping you, silly, 'cause you disrespected me.



Mrs. Gueermo

Ooohohoo!

-----


South Park Elementary. The four boys approach the school

Cartman

You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.

Kyle

You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.

Cartman

Fuck you, Kyle! [upon entering the building, they are met by a pre-class musical production]

Kids


And you know, we're together at school again.



Jimmy


School again.



Stan

Aww!

Kids


With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.



Cartman

Oh God, shut up!

Kids


Together at school again. What a special day.



Cartman

Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!

Kids


We could say that neverrrrrrrrrrr
Goes away.



-----


The school bell rings and everyone goes to class. Stan catches up to Bridon

Stan

Hey kid, what happened?! I-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!

Bridon

Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.

Stan

Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself! [sees someone down the hall] Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett. [Mr. Garrett, the school coach, is eating an apple] This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.

Mr. Garrett

Really?

Bridon

[looks down and away] Look, I should be getting to class.

Mr. Garrett

Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department.

Stan

You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.

Bridon

I don't know...

Mr. Garrett

Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team.

Stan

Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!

Bridon

Okay.

-----


Recess. The basketball team is assembled in the school gym. Bridon is at the free-throw line and shoots

Mr. Garrett

Aayy, that's great, Bridon.

Bridon

Thanks.

Jason

We might have a chance at winning now. [the doors open at the far end of the gym and Mr. Gueermo enters]

Mr. Gueermo

Bridon! 
What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!



Bridon

Dad, I was just messin' around.

Mr. Gueermo

I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!

Mr. Garrett

Eh, your kid is really good at this.

Mr. Gueermo

Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! [Bridon puts his arm up in self-defense]

Mr. Garrett

Just... go easy on him, huh?

Mr. Gueermo

[gasps, then raises his right hand up to strike] You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!

Mr. Garrett

If he wants to play ball, you should let him.

Mr. Gueermo

I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!

Mr. Garrett

He's just a kid.

Mr. Gueermo

[slap] You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. [slap]

Bridon

Dad, stop!

Mr. Gueermo

You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself [slaps with his left hand this time] There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you- [right-hand slap] Slap it, I'll slap it! [left-hand slap. He then pulls Bridon out of the gym.]

Bridon

Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me.

Mr. Gueermo

Shut up, Bridon! [as he reaches the doors, they open and Mr. Mackey appears]

Mr. Mackey

Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?

Mr. Gueermo

Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?! [Mackey doesn't reply, but he slaps him anyway] I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! [exits the gym, but returns to slap Mackey again, then leaves again]

-----


In the hallway, father and son hurry along.

Mr. Gueermo

You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?! [Stan watches them walk by, his plan dashed] You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!

Bridon

You're hurting my arm.

Mr. Gueermo

Stupid-ass boy!

Stan

[sighs deeply] Ah, shit.

-----


Scott's house. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny are playing a video game.

Cartman

Oh that's good, that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle. [Stan walks into the living room and stands to one side of the sofa] Yeah, nice.

Stan

You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.

Kyle

What? Are you crazy?

Cartman

No way dude.

Kyle

We promised each other we would never do that, remember?

Kenny

(Yeah.)

Stan

I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.

Scott Malkinson

What's so bad about hanging out with me?

Cartman

Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."

Scott

Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!

Cartman

"Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson." [Kenny laughs]

Stan

You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?

Kyle

Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.

Kenny

(Yeah!)

Stan

That isn't true! [no one challenges] Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids

Scott

Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.

Cartman

"That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."

-----


The Gueermo house, living room, night. Bridon looks out the window as his father dances to High School Musical on screen

Mr. Gueermo

Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. [the doorbell rings and Mr. Gueermo pauses the video and prances to the door. He opens it and two adults appear]

Male CPS Agent

Mister... Gueermo?

Mr. Gueermo

[barks] What?

Male CPS Agent

[shows his official badge] We're from Child Protective Services. [puts it away] There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child?

Mr. Gueermo

What? Who the hell's been saying that?!

Female CPS Agent

We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.

Male CPS Agent

His name is Stan Marsh.

Mr. Gueermo

You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world of hurt about to come your way!

Male CPS Agent

Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son.

Mr. Gueermo

[performs a sweeping gesture to usher them in] Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! [the agents enter and walk over to Bridon]

Male CPS Agent

Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly. [Mr. Gueermo sneaks up behind him, ready to slap him at any moment] We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's okay and just maybe... [Mr. Gueermo whistles, Mr. Kelly turns around, and Mr. Gueermo slaps him]

Mr. Gueermo

Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?! [slap] No, there's another one!

Female CPS Agent

Oh my God!

Mr. Gueermo

[moves over to the female agent] Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you! [slaps her] There's a slap for you! [three slaps follow] Slap, slap, slap! [slaps Mr. Kelly three more times] Yeah, there you go! [slaps the female agent again] Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap! [slaps the female agent, then slaps Mr. Kelly. Mrs. Gueermo rushes in to intervene and take the slaps]

Mrs. Gueermo

Oh God, please, you have to get away! He won't ever stop! [he slaps her seven times]

Mr. Gueermo

Awww. I'm going slap-happy! [chases after the agents and slaps them several more times before they finally reach their car] 
I'm going slap, slap-happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house!

 [the agents pull away quickly. He notices his next-door neighbor looking on from his own doorway] What are you looking at, Robertson? [in a flash he slaps Robertson three times, and just as quickly he's back inside his house and closes the front door.]

-----


South Park Elementary, next day, hallway. Bebe has something to say.

Bebe

They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! [the kids react and gather round the results sheet on the bulletin board. Butters is on a stool checking out the results for everyone]

Butters

Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. [the girls congratulate her and Wendy says something in reply]

Clyde

Who's the male lead?

Butters

No surprise there. It's Bridon. [the boys and a few girls congratulate Bridon, who stays quiet] I get to be a stand-in! [moments later Wendy catches up to Bridon. Stan looks on from a distance]

Wendy

Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.

Bridon

[not enthused] Yeah, great.

Stan

God damn it! [walks away. The next scene is him walking down the hall] No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop. [some kids look at him and decide to follow] And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? [he stops, the kids stop walking but continue snapping their fingers. Soon they smile in anticipation...]

Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
[the kids' anticipation fades. Stan isn't singing as they'd hope he would]
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
[Wendy, Bebe, and some other kids arrive]
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
[no one is making a sound. Stan puts his hands in his pockets, hangs his head, then turns left and walks away]

The Gueermo house, night. Mr. Gueermo is getting ready for bed... in an unusual way.

Mr. Gueermo


You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-



Mrs. Gueermo

[enters in a panic] Oh please. You have to do something.

Mr. Gueermo

What are you interrupting me for?!

Mrs. Gueermo

It's our son, he's- he's running away.

Mr. Gueermo

What?! [rushes downstairs and stops with flair behind Bridon, who's steps away from the front door] 
What's going on here, what's this all about?

 [brings his arms up and out, pointing to Bridon at the end with his left hand] 
What do you think you're doing?



Bridon

Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-

Mr. Gueermo

Nono! Sing it!

Bridon

[throws his duffle bag down] No! I'm sick of singing!

Mr. Gueermo


Can you believe it? What'd he just say? What's the matter with kids these days?

 [fixes his gaze on his wife, who's terrified for a bit.]

Mrs. Gueermo

[slowly, carefully] 
Kids these days.



Mr. Gueermo


Kids these days!

 [Bridon ignores him and opens the door. His father flies through the air and slams the door shut with his body] 
Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!



Bridon

Just let me go.

Mr. Gueermo

Go ahead. Make my day. [gets down on his left knee and threatens] You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red handprints all over face! [Bridon punches him on the nose] Ow! [covers his nose and stands up] Oh my God, what was that? [runs to his wife] Did you see that?! Oh my God, it hurts so bad! [she punches him harder] Ow. What the "H" is going on?! [she punches him again, and he runs off, crying. Bridon looks on in awe] What are you doing?! Everyone's crazy!

-----


Stan's house, the same night. He's on the sofa immersing himself in the High School Musical movies. Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Scott enter.

Kyle

Well, I had to see it to believe it!

Cartman

I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.

Stan

Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.

Kyle

We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!

Kenny

(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)

Stan

Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!

Kyle

You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!

Stan

Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!

Scott

'At's enough, you guys, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-

Cartman

You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.

Stan

Look, guys. [gets off the sofa and walks away from the other boys] The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school. [turns around to face them] And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now, [points to them] everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.

Cartman

That's a low blow, Stan.

South Park Elementary, day, the school gym. A basketball game is in progress, five on five. Mr. Mackey and Mr. Adler are doing play-by-play. "Rock & Roll Part II" plays from the speakers

Mr. Mackey

Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.

Mr. Garrett

All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?

Bridon

[approaches wearing #11] I'm ready, coach.

Mr. Garrett

Give 'em hell! [Bridon goes in and faces off against the Bobcats' #9. He tosses the ball over to #7, Bradley, and then notices his parents on the bleachers. His mom waves hi, his dad looks away displeased.]

Mr. Mackey

Just a minute to go in the first quarter. [Bridon gets the ball back and shots from the top of the key for a 3 pointer. Everyone applauds him, but his father still isn't looking at him. Mr. Gueermo does, however, notice the crowd's excitement and soon gets into it himself. The song changes to "We Will Rock You" and the crowd gets into that with two stomps and a clap. Mr. Gueermo joins right in]

South Park, next day. The kids are milling around the entrance, so classes haven't started yet.

Bebe

Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?

Bridon

I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.

Wendy

You gave it up?

Stan


[walks into view with the other three boys] That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. [music begins to play]

'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. [walks up to a boy and girl]
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. [walks back to Bridon]
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball



Cartman

[approaches two other kids] 
But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.



Stan


Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
[the four boys form a chorus line and dance]



Boys


You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
[Kyle whips off his hat while approaching two girls]
True, girl, you know it's true, [returns to the chorus line] that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.
[Kyle dances away to two other girls]



Kyle


Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. [Cartman dances over to two kids]



Cartman


And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- [rejoins the chorus line with Kyle]



Boys:


Do what you wanna do.
Just make sure that what you're doing is what's cool and popular with everyone
Chew, baby, chew and chew.
When you're eating jerky, if eating jerky is what you wanna do.



Bebe

[arrives with Wendy, Red, and another girl during the song] Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?

Bridon

Uhh, sure. [the girls follow him to the gym. The other students go their separate ways.]

Kyle


Do what you want, don't have restraint.



Cartman


Don't stress about it or you just might faint.



Kenny


(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)



Stan


Try to do what you wanna do!



Boys


Do what you wanna do.
As long as what you wanna do is what everybody wants you to.
Glue, baby, buy some glue
Just in case if what you're doin' [Stan continues singing, they all keep dancing]



Stan


involves needing scissors and glue!



Scott

Hey guys. Hey guys! [all stop. Stan looks around and doesn't see anyone else]

Stan

Huh? [the other boys turn around]

Kyle

Where did everybody go?

Scott

The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.

Stan

But the girls like singing and dancing.

Scott

No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.

Stan

But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
