==Fictional character biography==
===Joseph "Joe" Timms===
'''Joe Timms''' was born in Miami, Florida. Timms is a petty criminal who escaped from prison to see his dying wife, until he drowned in the swamp bog for several years. Then, nuclear waste brought him back to life as a large, [[Slime (toy)|slimy]], and shambling monster named the '''Glob''', with immense strength, but with very little brainpower.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=139}}</ref> It terrorized [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]], fought the [[Hulk]], and got dissolved by an experimental anti-radiation fluid in the murky waters.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #121. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly thereafter, the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] resurrected it for a second battle against the Hulk. An explosion blew up the Glob into tiny fragments.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #129. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Glob's brain later reformed into the Golden Brain. Yagzan and the Cult of Entropy used it as a weapon, but lost by the Entropists in an encounter with the [[Man-Thing]]. The Golden Brain psionically molded itself into an amnesiac blond-haired man. The man had been captured and mutated by Yagzan into a clay-based [[Outline of life forms|lifeform]] of the Glob. It battled the Man-Thing, reducing itself to mud again, which suffocates Yagzan, and killed him.<ref>''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, it was later revealed that the Glob had been enslaved by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. It eventually rebelled against him with the assistance of the Hulk and the Man-Thing.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #197-198. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Glob then got taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody where they recruited it in their organization's [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Paranormal Containment Unit]].<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #2-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, the Glob became an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Sumner Samuel Beckwith===

|character_name=Glob II 
|real_name=Sumner Samuel Beckwith
|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]
|debut=''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #389 (Jan. 1992)

|alliances=[[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] 
|species=[[List of swamp monsters|Swamp monster]]

'''(As Glob II)'''

*[[Bog]] manipulation
}}
'''Sumner Samuel Beckwith''' was a geneticist working for the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] that injected himself with an experimental duplicate of the Super-Soldier Serum in which he created (after discovering the journals of Ted Sallis, who becomes the Man-Thing due to his own research in recreating the formula), turns out to be [[Product defect|defective]]. He transformed into a light-green semi-humanoid being seemingly composed of bog matter and became the new '''Glob'''. It fled to the Florida Everglades, menaced [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and even battled the Hulk, who mistook it for the original Glob. It got [[Incineration|incinerated]] by the Man-Thing's touch after feeling fear.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #389. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both the Globs were monstrous creatures resembling a semi-solid mass of vegetable matter, with inhuman strength, stamina, and durability, though limited in brainpower and athletics. The Globs' bodies are difficult to harm, because their [[Mud|muddy]] exteriors can absorb physical attacks painlessly.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Vol 1 #4 (September 2008)</ref>

Joe Timms became the first Glob as a result from exposure to [[toxic waste]] in the [[swamp]]. As the Golden Brain, it has the ability to materialize an electrically-charged duplicate of its Glob form and recreate a physically perfect human body for itself.

Sumner Beckwith became the second Glob when he injected himself with a duplicate version of the Super-Soldier Formula. Unlike the original, it could excrete slime-like material from its own body to smother living beings or regenerate lost limbs. He earned a Ph.D. in [[genetics]], before his transformation.
