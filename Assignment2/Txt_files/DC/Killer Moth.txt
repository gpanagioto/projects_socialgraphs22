'''Killer Moth''' ('''Drury Walker''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], usually as an adversary and dedicated original [[Foil (narrative)|foil personality]] of [[Batman]] (prior to the creations of [[Wrath (comics)|Wrath]], [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]], and [[Hush (character)|Hush]]). Like Batman, he has no superpowers and relies on his technical equipment, including a Mothmobile and numerous gimmicks. Killer Moth originally wore a garish costume of purple and green striped fabric, with an orange cape and a moth-like mask.<ref name="dc-ency1"/> In ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', Killer Moth is transformed into the monster '''Charaxes''' with superhuman abilities.

== Publication history ==
[[File:Batman063.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Killer Moth's debut.]]
Killer Moth first appeared in ''Batman'' #63 (February 1951) and was created by [[Bill Finger]], [[Dick Sprang]], and [[Lew Schwartz]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=63}}</ref>

== Fictional character biographies ==
=== "Cameron van Cleer" ===
The original Killer Moth was a prisoner identified only by his prison number, 234026.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=62}}</ref> While in prison, he reads a newspaper article about [[Batman]] and decides to set himself up as the "anti-Batman", hiring himself out to [[Gotham City]]'s criminals to help them elude capture by police. Upon his release, he uses the hidden proceeds of his crimes to build a "Mothcave", modeled on the photos of the [[Batcave]] in the newspaper article he read. Killer Moth also establishes a false identity as millionaire philanthropist '''Cameron van Cleer'''. In this guise, he becomes friends with Bruce Wayne.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 1: Batman |date=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co |isbn=0-02-538700-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco01flei |url-access=registration |access-date=29 March 2020 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco01flei/page/256 256]–257}}</ref> Meanwhile, he promotes himself to Gotham's criminals using his identity as Killer Moth, giving them each an [[infrared]] Moth-Signal. In his first job, he rescues some criminals from the police and then uses his Mothmobile to defeat and capture Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. The duo escape and lead Killer Moth to a climactic battle on Gotham Bridge, in which he is defeated.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=176}}</ref> In his third appearance (''Detective Comics'' #173 (July 1951)) Killer Moth kidnaps Bruce Wayne and learns his secret identity. However, he is shot by other criminals and the resultant cranial injury causes [[amnesia]]. He remains a persistent enemy through the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], being the first villain [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] encounters in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359 (January 1967). He teams up with the [[Cavalier (comics)#Mortimer Drake|Cavalier]] twice: the first time in ''[[Batman Family]]'' #10 (March-April 1977), where they battle Batgirl and [[Batwoman#Publication history|Batwoman]] (Kathy Kane, who comes out of retirement for the first time in years) and the second (and final) time in ''Batman Family'' #15 (December 1977-January 1978), where they battle Batgirl and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].

=== Drury Walker ===
In the 1990s, in the Post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' continuity, Killer Moth's real identity is revealed as '''Drury Walker''', an unsuccessful criminal whom no one takes seriously. He again adopts the false identity of Cameron van Cleer and the persona of Killer Moth to fight Batman. This version first appears in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7-9 (December 1992-February 1993), with a more detailed origin story appearing in ''[[Batgirl: Year One]]'' #1-9 (February-October 2003).

In ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #7-9, Killer Moth sets up a team called "the Misfits", comprising Batman villains such as the [[Catman (DC Comics)|Catman]] and the [[Calendar Man]], to make another kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne, as well as other prominent citizens. This team proves unsuccessful, turning against Killer Moth when they realize he plans to kill the hostages.<ref>''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #7-9</ref> He is one of the villains who sells their souls to the demon-lord [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' #1 (November 1995) and in ''[[Robin (character)|Robin]]'' (vol. 2) #23-24 (December 1995-January 1996), where he asks to become feared instead of always being laughed at. He is metamorphosed into a carnivorous moth-like monster called Charaxes. As Charaxes, Walker resembles a vaguely humanoid, giant brown moth. He consumes humans and spins [[Silkworm cocoons|cocoon]]s in which to keep his prey.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=85–86}}</ref> In a later story, Charaxes begins laying hundreds of eggs, all of which hatch into duplicates of Drury Walker. Charaxes despises his progeny, but is unable to destroy them. Following his capture, these duplicates are taken into government custody. During an argument between various bodies as to what should be done with them, they attack a scientist and are killed.<ref>''Robin'' (vol. 2) #107-110 (December 2002-March 2003)</ref> At around the same time, the [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] is confronted by a criminal named Danko Twag who claims to be the "real" Killer Moth (the one she had defeated), and that Drury Walker had been an impostor. During a rant in which he claims they are going to be a team, she captures him in an energy cell and he seemingly disintegrates himself.<ref>''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #50-52 (February-April 2003)</ref>

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Charaxes is killed by being ripped in half by [[Superboy-Prime]] during the [[Battle of Metropolis]].<ref name="dc-ency1">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Charaxes | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 77 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017 }}</ref> In order to ensure the existence of [[Batman]], [[Rip Hunter]] tells [[Booster Gold]] and [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]] that they have to make sure Wiley Dalbert, a time-travelling criminal who had hired Killer Moth, completes his crime successfully. Booster does this by dressing up as Killer Moth and taking his place. During the robbery, he is forced to fight with Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and takes them both down. An unfortunate, unintended side effect of this is that, when they return to the present, Gotham still has no Batman and Killer Moth is now a serious threat, thanks to the "[[street cred]]" from the robbery.<ref>''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #11 (October 2008)</ref> Booster, Skeets and his sister [[Michelle Carter (comics)|Goldstar]] attempt to fix the anomaly they created by taking Batman's place in the robbery, but things go wrong when [[Alfred Pennyworth]] intervenes; the Time Masters barely escape in the [[Batmobile]]. Instead they steal [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl's]] costume and purchase an [[Elvis]] costume for Booster. Booster stops the version of him dressed as Killer Moth from defeating Batman and makes sure that Wiley gets away with the loot, thus restoring the timeline.<ref>''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #12 (November 2008)</ref>

During the ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' series' ''[[Blackest Night]]'' tie-in story, Charaxes is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #4 (November 2009)</ref> Superboy-Prime destroys Charaxes on Earth Prime, using the black ring cycling through the power set, resulting in a burst of colored energy that destroys Black Lanterns.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #5 (December 2009)</ref> In ''[[The New 52]]'', a more serious, less garish Drury Walker/Killer Moth appears as an enemy of [[Green Arrow]]. <ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #25</ref> This version, preferring the title "Moth", utilizes a gas mask and a compression gun which he calls a "Stinger". Moth later appeared as a member of [[Richard Dragon]]'s [[Longbow Hunters]].<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #31</ref> He first appeared in the "[[Zero Year]]" story arc in which he was defeated by both Batman and Green Arrow, teaming up for the first time.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #25</ref> In ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Killer Moth is again Drury Walker, a low-level criminal sporting a purple outfit and helmet.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #958</ref> 

=== Unknown ===
A new Killer Moth appears in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #652, during the ''[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]'' storyline wherein he displays competence in hand-to-hand combat and the ability of flight when facing Robin. He later appears working alongside fellow Gotham criminals the [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]] and [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] in the ''[[Gotham Underground]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]]. The identity and origins of this new Killer Moth remain unrevealed. Several villains clad in Killer Moth costumes appear in ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' (vol. 3) #7. At least one of them is killed by [[Deadshot (comics)|Deadshot]]. Killer Moth recently appeared in the first issue of the miniseries ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]''. He was hired by [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]] to kidnap and torture Mike Dante, ex-assistant to Atom ally Professor Hyatt. The two current holders of the Atom identity, [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] and [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]], tracked Killer Moth and his goons down to a hideout in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] and defeated them all. Ray Palmer then tortured Killer Moth by entering his head via the nasal pathways and growing inside his skull. Killer Moth immediately gave up Prometheus as his employer. In ''[[Red Robin (comic book)|Red Robin]]'' #9, Red Robin returns to Gotham City where he runs into Killer Moth in his classic costume, holding a man at gunpoint. Red Robin thinks to himself: "I think this is Killer Moth. The costume and the man change from time to time, so you can never really tell". This Killer Moth seems to be scared and on the run, stating: "Are you with him? Are you with the Atom? I won't let you torture me, too!"

== Powers and abilities ==
In his original incarnation, Killer Moth has no [[superhuman]] abilities; he relies on the vast array of equipment he has developed. Killer Moth’s range of gimmicks includes a Mothmobile, a Moth-Signal, and a steel line, which allows him to swing through the skies as if he were flying. He carries a [[pupa|cocoon]] gun that fires a stream of sticky threads that can totally envelop a victim. The gun can also fire a grenade. As Charaxes, he has superhuman strength, agility and endurance, an exoskeleton that gives him some protection from physical and energy attacks, a set of wings that allows him to fly, sharp claws and sharp, prehensile antennae. Charaxes secretes a sticky [[acid]]ic substance that can trap the strongest of men and dissolve their bodies. In ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', he uses a highly compressed air gun to great effect as a weapon, shown to be powerful enough to stop a bullet in mid-air.

== Other versions ==
=== ''Teen Titans Go!'' ===
In the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (2004 comic series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic book series, Killer Moth was the second villain to arrive at the tower for the [[Teen Titans|Titans]]' Party Party and informed them that he only attended to spend more time with Silkie. Throughout the party, he cuddled with the mutant moth larva until [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ordered all the villains to leave, including Killer Moth. Killer Moth attacked Jump City and told the Titans they were outmatched. He noticed [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], who had been disguised, and asked about his identity. [[Beast Boy]] lied to him, telling him that Cyborg was their brand new Killer Robot Titan and asked Killer Moth if he wanted to see how he fared against one. The villain, however, immediately left.

=== ''Batman: Arkham Knight'' ===
In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'''s prequel comic, after the events of ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', following the defeat of [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]], Drury Walker checked out books from [[Barbara Gordon]] at the local library about moths and staked out her and her father, the newly-promoted [[Commissioner Gordon]], which Barbara noticed. Later, at a GCPD panel that proved Batman was simply a man with gadgets instead of some 'paranormal entity', Killer Moth crashed it to advertise his services with a free trial of killing Commissioner Gordon while his henchmen kept Batman preoccupied on the other side of Gotham. Barbara quickly put on the sample Batman costume, managed to defeat Killer Moth's henchmen, and disarmed the villain. After he realized that his plans were falling apart, Killer Moth threw Gordon off the rafters to kill him and used that as a diversion for his escape. As Barbara saved her father, Walker made his escape and tried to calm himself down by saying that Batgirl was just a girl in a suit like Batman, who happened to arrive just in time and subdued him.

=== ''Injustice 2'' ===
Killer Moth appears in the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice 2]]''. Following the events of the first game, Killer Moth is shown to be a member of this universe's [[Suicide Squad]],<ref>''Injustice 2'' #1</ref> but after an impostor Batman (later revealed to be [[Jason Todd]]) surprisingly appears and takes control of the Squad, he kills Killer Moth using the bomb implanted in his neck, considering him to be useless.<ref>''Injustice 2'' #2</ref>

* A short episode of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' series that introduced [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] featured Killer Moth (portrayed by [[Tim Herbert]]), but it was never aired.

* When asked about Killer Moth's inclusion in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', producer [[Bruce Timm]] expressed little interest and joked that the only way they would use him is if they can cast Canadian actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] for the role and have him scream, "I'm a bug!". Producer Alan Burnett, on the other hand, stated, "we just haven't thought of a good story for him yet". Ultimately, Killer Moth never appeared in the series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/unused/batman/killermoth.php|title=The World's Finest - Backstage - Unused Villians Database - Killer Moth}}</ref>
