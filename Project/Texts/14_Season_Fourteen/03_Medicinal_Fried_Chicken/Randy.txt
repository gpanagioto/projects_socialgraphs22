 Hey, uh, what's up with the KFC? Alright, boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on.  Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC? Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!  My huh? Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back!   KFC's gone, been replaced. Yeah, well, I gotta get to the doctor.  I gotta get to the doctor!  All right! That's great. So can I get a referral from you? Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed. But you said I'm totally healthy! ...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer? Yeah, but what's the quickest way? Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver? Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay.   Stan? Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon! SCORE!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?! Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival... One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush! Uh that is nice! That is nice! I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh? Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer!    Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing. No, Peter Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer. Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em. Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies.  See? Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed? I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed. Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh? Hey. My eyes are up here. It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe.  Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please? Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over? Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high? What do we want? Where do we want them? What do we want? Where do we want them? Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls.  Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir.  And when it gets cold it shrinks.
