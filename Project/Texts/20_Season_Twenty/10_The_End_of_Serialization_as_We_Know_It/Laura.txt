 The son of a bitch. He's such a bastard. When you marry someone and you think you know them... TrollTrace. Its up and running.  It can tell you anybody's Internet history.  I couldn't resist. I looked up my husband.  The websites he's visited are just...disgusting! Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see. About what? Its not our kids we have to be worried about.  My husband was on three "married-but-dating" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends? Sure, yeah. Respect. Nice of you to give him that.  Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?
