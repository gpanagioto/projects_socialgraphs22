Well the way I heard it was that the girl in the school wasn't even doing anything. Just talking too loud. And someone ends up getting shot.  Mayor, what are you going to do about this? My wife and I can barely eat or shop. Why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that? Jeez, this is so embarrassing.
