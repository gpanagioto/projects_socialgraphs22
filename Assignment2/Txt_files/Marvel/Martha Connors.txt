'''Martha Connors''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is usually depicted as a supporting character of [[Spider-Man]], and the wife of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], also known as the Lizard. Much of her character's story revolves around her constant suffering, yet perseverance through her husband's constant transformations. Martha was later injected with Curt's Lizard Formula to cure her of a deadly virus, which also mutated her into an anthropomorphic lizard. 

==Publication history==
The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #6 (November 1963).

==Fictional character biography==
Sometime before her first appearance, Martha met and married surgeon and biologist [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]. Together they had a son named [[Billy Connors (comics)|Billy]] and their life seemed perfect. However, Curt, an amputee, was looking for a way to regrow lost limbs. Despite Martha warning him about the dangers of experimenting on himself, fearing for his safety, Curt created a Lizard Formula and injected himself with it, transforming into a feral lizard monster. Martha later ran into [[Spider-Man]], who already had an encounter with the Lizard, and told him what really happened, prompting the wall-crawler to track down and cure Curt, albeit temporarily.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #6</ref>

At one point, Martha and Billy were kidnapped by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] branch led by [[Silvermane]], who wanted Curt to decipher an ancient tablet. Once again, Curt transformed into the Lizard and it took the combined effort Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] to save Martha and Billy, who were happily reunited with a cured Curt. Although Curt would continue to transform into the Lizard time and time again, Martha would not abandon him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #74-77</ref>
