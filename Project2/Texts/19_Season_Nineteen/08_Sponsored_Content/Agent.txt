The average human can no longer tell the difference between the news and an ad. You seem to have some mental ability that allows you to know the difference. The PC People are simply being manipulated, unwittingly setting the table for the new enemy of humanity.  What if I were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us? And now they're manipulating everything we do?  It was our own fault. Mankind became tired of ads, so we kept inventing ways to make things ad-free. We even created ad blockers. That's when the ads had to adapt. They had to disguise themselves as news in order to survive. If you really can tell the difference, then you could be the key to saving our species, Jimmy. We'd like to run a test on you. Jesus Christ, he's off the charts. That's a perfect score. You are a very special child, Jimmy. We have another child here who's special too.  Well Jimmy? What do you think?
