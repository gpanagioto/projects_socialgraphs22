You just want ''Family Guy'' off the air... You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! What the hell is going on?  Who? Thanks a lot for the ride. I'll do everything I can.  Do you know which way the network president's office is? Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting ''Family Guy'' off the air. Oh thanks, dude.  Ow!  Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this? Cartman! You fat son of a bitch! Well, a lot of people like ''Family Guy'' too! Who are ''you'' to decide it shouldn't be on the air?! Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!! WHAT?!  You fucking fatass! That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a ''monster'' like you!  You are not. Killing. Family Guy!  Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass! Ow. Quit it! Ow. Quit it! No more timeouts, fatass!  Thanks, kid.  Sir! Mister television executive! Stop! Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of ''Family Guy'' forever! Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to ''Laverne & Shirley''. What manatees??!!   No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President! Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech! Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants ''Family Guy'' off the air! You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence! Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're ''allowing'' terrorism to work. Do the right thing here. Do the right thing, Mr. President. I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more. If you don't show Mohammad, then ''you've'' made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.  Do. The right. Thing. Yes!
