Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too- Hey Eric!  Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!" Well, sure I can see you.  Well, jeez Eric, why ''wouldn't'' I be able to hear you?  You died?? How?? But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you? HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people! Me! I saw a ghost! But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now! Ruh, really? So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then? Huh s-s-super-AIDS? AAAH!  Oh Jesus. Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.   Go away! You aren't real!  Well I saw...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare. Y yes, yes sir.  AH-  But I don't want to see you! Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven? Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck. Oh. I can't. Ahah, I have school tomorrow. Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you! Mrs. Cartman? This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something. He says, he love you.  He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes. He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted. Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times. He can't! Don't you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him! Uhh alright then.   Aww, that's okay, Eric. So I won't see you again? Wow. Yeh you're still here. Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough. Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did. Did you ever do anything really bad?  Broke fence... Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for. Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know ''how'' you're gonna make up for all this. Does this mean... you have to go now? Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason. Eric! Calm down. I-I-it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!  So... the ghost ''was'' in my head. The whole time. Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore. Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event. Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!  Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you? Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably ''isn't'' a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane. Really? Well, he's sittin' next to me right now. Hey, I think she could see you too. You really ''are'' a ghost. Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me. Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal. Hurry. Go, go!  Boy, we sure did. Yeah. Uh I feel that way too. I'll miss you too, ghost pal. Huh? Huh but I thought you ''were'' one! Oh hamburgers.
