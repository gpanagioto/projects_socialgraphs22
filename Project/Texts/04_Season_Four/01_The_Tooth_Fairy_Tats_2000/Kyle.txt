He's fat and he's stupid? No way! ''I'' only got a jar of gefilte fish. ...Totally ''what?'' Me too.  You still have baby teeth, Kenny?  Almost. You ready, Timmy? When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy? Right. You're Timmy. Alright! Get ready, Timmy.  Dude, maybe we ''don't'' have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth. Yeah, let's go.  No, Timmy, wait! Come on, fatass! Did the tooth fairy come? Four dollars? No more money?? Cartman, what's going on?! What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?" That can't be. ''My'' parents wouldn't lie to me.  You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real! It's not true!  Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?  Oh my God! You ''did'' lie to me.  Peter Pan, too?? What about Moses and Abraham? ''Pro''bably?! Is Atlantis real??  Wahahahah! Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah!  What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real? All made up. Not real. Nothing's real. Oh my God, what if ''I'm'' not real? I mean, what if I'm just part of my ''parents''' reality? What if this is all just somebody's dream? Two years? Cartman! See ya.  Dude, ''this'' book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality. Oh my God, ''this'' book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.  Dude, ''this'' book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't? I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist! But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together?  Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading. Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means ''all'' matter is just a wave.  I am nothing, and everything. Hunh. That was pretty weird. Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
