Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns Where?  Go away, please. Two hours. Damn, dude.  Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in? Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over.  Dude, this isn't working. Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again!  I'm tired, Grandpa. I don't know.  Hurry up, you guys! Dude, you're not gonna believe this. Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania. Will you guys be in ''our'' Cirque du Celville? Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first. Okay, hold it, hold it.  What?!  Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they? They have nowhere else to go.  Please? That's your dad?  Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you?? No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on!  Okay, let's try it again. Hup! No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America. ''Now'' what do we do?  Dammit, now I'm ''never'' gonna have my own circus! The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us. Yeah! Well, not this time! We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now! Uh, sure, you can all get overtime. Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!  Yeah. Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways. Whatever happened to Kenny?
