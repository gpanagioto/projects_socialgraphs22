This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake.  Well, keep looking.  This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes? Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh... Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake! Ooooh!  Comanche helicopters... ...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time... Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play ''The Stars and Stripes''! Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus! Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole! Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours! Shut up! Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing. Wait a minute... It's the snake! Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare! Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing ''The Stars and Stripes''! What is fuck is that?! Oh, hell. Light the snake! My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity. Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out? Yes, you know, expire, end. Hello? I'm asking you when it stops? What?!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?! So when does it run out?! Oh, hell..! Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly.
