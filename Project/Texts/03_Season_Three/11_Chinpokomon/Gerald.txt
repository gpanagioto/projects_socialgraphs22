Yeah, I guess so. Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something. You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand? Hm... Good point; here's $10.  Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too.  Oh God, is there nothing we can do?
