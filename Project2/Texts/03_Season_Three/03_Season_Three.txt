Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people <i>[she walks to the group and smiles]</i> for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame <i>[she frowns]</i>, but please, give her your full attention.  Go ahead. <i>[angrily]</i> Eric Cartman, you say ‘’excuse me”! <i>[to the choir teacher]</i> Go ahead. Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! <i>[to the choir teacher]</i> Go ahead. Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! <i>[sighs deeply and tells the choir teacher]</i> Go ahead. All right, that does it!!  Oh, here comes the guilt trip again.  I, I do not know you, sir. And that, children, is what you need to know about ''The Facts Of Life''. So, let's review.  Sure.  Well children, I ''am'' your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so. Oh, the old succubus syndrome. A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man. Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love. Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!" Sure, kids.  Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!  Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day!  Poontang's poontang. <poem><i> And never let poontang come between you and your friend.</i></poem> I'll keep it at my house. What?! How dare you say that?! Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut. Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever! Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class.  O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history.  Yes? O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?  Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!  Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything! Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school. Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric? ...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Peetie, the Sexual Harassment Panda.  Say "hi" to Sexual Harassment Panda! No, I had no freakin' idea! Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment! I'm sorry, toots. Yes. Well, he ''is'' a little ass-sucker.  Okay, baby, I'm sorry. Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions?  Yes, Stan? Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits. Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun.   Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today.  Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president? Uh, Craig, how about you?  Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum... Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda.  That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that? Well, hell, turn it up. He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up. And the winner of the costume contest is  Okay, children, I want it quiet!  Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three? '''''No, goddammit, it's eighteen!!''''' For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand! '''''What did he say?!''''' '''''Damnit, this is not Japan!!''''' '''''Aggghhh!'''''  I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp. What? Well, uh-I guess that's true. You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe. Okay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark?  Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark? Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark? Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk ''all'' these little bastards.  Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff. Oh, please God, let it be forever. ...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay.  Uh, can I help you? Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?! I hope you give them the chair!  Mmm. It ''does'' taste like s'mores. Jimbo! Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!  You Yankee sons of bitches! That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too! I'll bet we could!  That can't be.  Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.  Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of "grab ass." You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses. Hohoho. Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season. Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake! He's coming out! Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas!  This sucks balls! Well, yeah, but that??  ...Well not like that! Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it?? Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma. Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?!  God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering! Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up.   Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.  Arkansas? Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second? Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.  ...father still lives there. I haven't seen my father for 23 years. ...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me. Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—  Aaaaaah!   Hello. Dad. Can I ...come in? No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did. I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things. Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it!  I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad! I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this! I know! I wanna know why not?! Was it that I was ugly?! I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?! Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy!  Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about.  Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me? He never did, Mom, not once.  He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did! You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep! Face it, Mother. He never abused me!  Mother won't hear the truth! You can't close your eyes forever, Mother!  Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.  Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.  Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something.  Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.  Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers. You don't love me!  I wanna die!   Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!  Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon. No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have. We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to. I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! ''[turns and heads cheerfully out the door] Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...'' Oh, no. What are they doing? Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus.  Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G. M-m-m.  Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home. Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning.  Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. <i>[cheerfully]</i> How are we all doing today?! <i>[the kids' eyes wander]</i> I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! <i>[Cartman farts]</i> Children, we are a national choir called, "Getting Gay With Kids!" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it! You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir <i>[Pip yawns and Bill notices. Clyde nods off]</i> where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest. So, who wants to join the fun?? Excuse me? Well, uh, that's all, really. <i>[the girl picks her nose, smiling at Kenny]</i> So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front. Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints. Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest. And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures. Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo. Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. <i>[the kids move to their windows and look out]</i> Oh! This is so exciting! Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S. Eric, sit down! Eric, SIT DOWN! Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their- Alll right, that does it! <i>[turns Cartman around]</i> Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant! You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me- Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President? Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do. Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow. Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States? We're the group singing for the "Save The Rainforest" summit tomorrow? <i>[her head is cocked way to the left by now. El Presidente has no clue. Now the teacher is worried]</i> Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. <i>[faces the kids]'' Children, do any of you speak Spanish? ''[Cartman waves his left arm]</i> Don't you dare! <i>[the main door opens]</i> Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish. Yeess! Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. <i>[moves aside]</i> All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin. Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. <i>[chuckles and shrugs. The people just look. She presses the play button. The kids begin to dance to the music]</i> Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle. Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be! Eric, what the heck are you doing?? <i>[the monkey flees]</i> <i>[pulls him away]</i> Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!! Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?! The Yanagopa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-! Stanley, what is it? <i>[in horror]</i> Oh my God!! <i>[the snake starts swallowing Pablo]</i> <i>[petrified]</i> Jesus Christ, is he dead?! <i>[Pablo's bones come out of the snake's anus]</i> Oh, no! God, no, no! <i>[spins around]</i> Don't panic, children. Maybe we came from that way. <i>[points to her left]</i> No, nno. Let's try this way. <i>[points to her right and moves that way]</i> Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick! Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here? Who's not?! No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley. Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us. Oh, really? Could you brush it off? <i>[shows her backpack, and a huge insect half her size growls on it]</i> <i>[panics]</i> Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! <i>[the insect growls and falls silent. Miss Stevens returns]</i> Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. <i>[sees the insect, still on her back]</i> Oh my God!! <i>[runs off]</i> Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps- Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost. <i>[giggles]</i> Cah heh, can you help us? Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. <i>[the soldier points a way out with his thumb]</i> Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! <i>[they leave]</i> Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government. <i>[addresses them with a lilt]</i> Oh, hello. Do you speak of English? Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. <i>[the soldiers just stare]</i> We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? <i>[no response]</i> Um... <i>[thinks]</i> Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song <i>[she moves aside]</i> <i>[through clenched teeth]</i> Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography. <i>[as the chorus nears, Kyle is still doing the wrong moves]</i> Oh, Kyle, please! <i>[the kids dance through the first line of the chorus...]</i> Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts. Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use? <i>[sullen]</i> Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography? Run, children, run!  Hello?? Anybody?? Help?? Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay?    Aaaah! Eric, where are you going? Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way! Young man, I have had it!! Good! You ''deserve'' to die, you little bastard!  Eric, we ''have'' to stay together! No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way. Oh God, this is a ''nightmare!'' We're ''never'' going to make the festival! Let's go, quickly!  Children, it's the Yanagopa.   Run for your lives, children! Run run ruuun!  Waaah! It's quicksand, people!   AAAAA!! All right, that does it!!  I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!  Hooray, children! How did you know where we were? Eric? What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment? Really?  That's great!! Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing! Does everybody remember the new lyrics?  And… Okay. What if you don't have any rhythm? Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm. Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. <i>[the other kids laugh]</i> Hey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch! <i>[drops down and pleads]</i> Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey. <i>[as he enters the bus]</i> Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls. Whoopee. Yeah, pretty much. <i>[hushed]</i> The nightmare begins. Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is! Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! <i>[Throws open his window and yells]</i> Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college! <i>[sits]</i> Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? <i>[Kenny looks at him angrily]</i> Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor. Whoa, dude, look over there! <i>[The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.]</i> Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys! Okay. <i>[pretends]</i> Cleek! <i>[grins]</i> <i>[rushing out]</i> Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here. <i>[covers his nose again]</i> I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass. I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks! Why? Eh-heheh! I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm! <i>[impatient]</i> Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We hear this a million times back up in the States. <i>[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey]</i> Bad! Bad monkey! <i>[it screams in pain]</i> <i>[stops]</i> I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head! <i>[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth]</i> It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth! <i>[throws the branch at the sloth]</i> Re’spect my authoritah! <i>[fed up, buries his face in his mitts]</i> Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!! He's a little wuss, what's it look like? <i>[Stan is hiding behind some foliage]</i> Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right! <i>[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him]</i> Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! <i>[hurries away, and the snake gives chase]</i> <i>[moves forward]</i> Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. <i>[the soldier listens]</i> We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. <i>[rubs his belly]</i> Y taco. Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.  This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore. I'm going this way!  Nononono! You ''nyah'', me ''nyah''!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home. <i>[walks away]</i> God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-   Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm ''starving'' to death! I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast! Food! I have to have food!     Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin? Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again? Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't- What the hell happened to him? I'm gonna be Jesus! Oh, and like you're gonna do it, ''Jew''?! Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home!  Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves.   Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't. This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home.  Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.  This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak. Peter! Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess. Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me. Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.   Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys. Up your ass with broken glass! Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!  Well, get me down from here! What?! Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  God!  Hey, there you guys are! You guys are in ''big'' trouble! Now get me down from here! You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down! ...Really?  Dude, superpowers are sweet.  You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here! Officer Barbrady!  Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here. You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down. Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.  Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now. You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this! Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stan and Kyle" song?! Ahem.  Chef! Chef! Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me! Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys! What? What?!  Oh, damnit! Hello-o.  Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now. Get me down from here! Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts. Mom, ''please'' can we just leave? But I ''hate'' the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat. That's what I ''told'' him, but he doesn't listen to ''reason''.   Hi, Doctor Lout.  Ey! Don't call me a little piggy! I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!  God damn it! Yes. I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! ''Mom!'' Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian! They look exactly the same. I don't know, two! Uh, one.  Two. Ow! I hate you!  Hey dudes. My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated. Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it! Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do. Hey, yeah!  Ow!  Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy. Can I have the yellow with a ''side'' of white? I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny.   Ow! My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean. Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a ''bitch'' she is. Bitch, I hate that bitch!  Stop calling me piggy! So, what does that mean?  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!  Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me. I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave! Ow! Son of a bitch! Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha! I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.  Uh, yeah, sure sure. Ey! Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses. Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef! Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind? Oh, no! Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow. But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus! Hey! You son of a bitch! Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days! Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus? Okay.  Aaah! It's the succubus!  What? What happened? You guys, it's six in the morning, I ''have'' to get some sleep. You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep.   What what what? I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard! Okay.  Ow!  Oh no! The tape jammed!   I can't see anything!  What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay? After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again! No, not with ''my'' eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Eh-sure. I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom. I have to go number two. No way, dude! What would I wipe with? Well what do I sit on?  Urgh. Come on, now. Stop, you guys! I can't think! I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream...  Oh, that did it.  What the? Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!  You guys, get over here! I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes. Come on! Let's kill it!   Come on, you guys! Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.  No! No. Don't. I like it. Wow! Cool! Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door. Should I get it? Okay. Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature! You mean the other jakovasaur? ''You're'' a jakovasaur; that's what they call you. But the other jakovasaur talked different. I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it. He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left.  Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke! No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in.  Jakov, I want you to meet my friends. Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny? We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend. No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.  Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.  "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..." I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."  Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction. You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor! If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct. Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!  Aren't they cute, you guys?   Hey, Jakov, how's it going?  Moving? You... can't leave. You're my friend.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you. Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. ''I'' need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?  Yes. Who would take care of them?  I have authoriteh?  Fine. Hi, Jakov.  Who's laughing? Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready.  What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show. Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.  Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys? Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix!   Jakov!  Open this door!  No! Jakov, don't go!  Don't, mother! Just, don't. No. That's okay. I'll see you guys.  Ooooohh. Oh, hello, excuse me, but ''Craig'' is the biggest troublemaker in ''our'' class. Told ya! I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class?  You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is.  Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass. ''Yeah'', I'll bet. Five bucks. Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater. Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it. I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.  No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today. You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked. Why don't we just raise our bet to ''ten'' dollars?! Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny! Those sons of bitches! Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek! Craig, you can watch ''Red Racer'' any day of the week!  Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig. Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed. Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?  After ''Red Racer'', of course.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge. Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something. Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch!  When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world. Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000. You're gonna be eating those words, asshole. Come on! What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other. You just hit each other, smack each other around.  I don't think ''that's'' very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna ''really'' kill Tweek.  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts! Fine!  Fine, that's fine! I'm ready!  Respect my authoritah!   Dude. Come on, now. Come on. I win! Hey, maybe.  The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right? Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong! Come on, Craig! Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass!  Come on, Craig! 'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it. Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad. Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig. Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar! When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind. I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool. What did you call me?  That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment! You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money. Oh, you did it again! You all heard him! Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second. Th... That is correct, my honor. He talked about having oral sex with my ass. Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  Hooray! Sweet..! Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game  Do you really like this remote-controlled truck? Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites? Oh, then you won't mind if I take it!  Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on. What? But uh, why should I sue the school? Interesting.  All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass! No way! This is ridiculous! Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no! Oh my God! You guys have to do something! Noooo!  What?! Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not? Where's that? I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors. You're-you're a worm. That's-that's cool, that's cool.  Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek! Are you okay, Salma Hayek? Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!   But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West. But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek. No, Kitty! I don't have anything! What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty! No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty!   Uh-huh.  Right. Aw, Ma.   Ow! You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV?  You're not allowed to have people over! This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!   Ey! I need to use the phone! Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah!    Ey, I was watching ''Aliens'' on TV! Who the hell are you? You know this guy? Christ, he's like 50 years old! Dude, that's not cool. Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit! Hey, what are you doing?  I'm gonna tell my mom on you. Ey! You ate all the pizza! That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass!  Give me that phone number!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over. God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip.  Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip.   Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now! Aaaaa!  Yes! I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home! You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can ''prove'' you had a boyfriend over heuh!  Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Oh! God dammit! Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!  You just want me to open the door! What?? Ih- is she okay? Huh?!  A''ha!'' I ''knew'' it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture! Haa''ha!'' I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it! O-kay! Let's see heuh. Ha''ha!'' Um... Aw, dammit!  Aw, man, you guys suck. You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!  Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head! Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh!  Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over! Well, there's a whole crappy band here!   Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?! I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here!  My Speak and Record bear. Of course.  Okay. See you in a while. Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly. Well, I just, I kind of like having you around. No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could ''pretend'' like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, ''we'' could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day. Yuh, you mean it? Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.  Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother ''is'' away at a party right now. That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve. I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh? I'm sorry. Did ''you'' say something, Skyler?  Agh! Gotcha!  Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway? You're not ugly. Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls? Weh-hull, I ''could'' ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know. If you want, I could help you. Just let me get my cowboy hat.  We don't have much time! Hurry up in there! That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face! Oh my God!  You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!  Uh oh. Yeah. I think we get along okay. Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat! Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush. That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West.  Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is? That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! ''You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—'' ''—Christmastime is presents for me.'' Eeyyy  Well, ''I'm'' going to Spooky Laboratory! ''[throws open the doors and enters] Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...'' Cool!  Ewww-hoohooo.  Oh-HO, grohoss. Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!  We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary. Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay  and, let's see...  Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas? That's only 72 shopping days left for ''you''! Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.  I can't go with you guys right now. Mom, seriously!  God-damnit, mom!  God, I hate you guys! How?  Spooky spider? You mean, we make something that ''looks'' like a dead body? So where the hell are we going to get a dead body? U-hi think that's a sweet idea!

Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.'' Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"  U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!  Uuh, problem, guys. Nno Grandma. Nno Grandma. Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff. How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?  Oh, no! This is ''my'' Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early! Wow, cool! That didn't help at all. Antonio, no!  No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders! No, Kitty!   No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?  Yes. Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!  Mom! Mom!  Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store! Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!  Mom-Mom! I've only just heard.

Sweet. Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon.  Oh, god damnit!  Hey, dickhole. I guess you saw the commercial, too. Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the cutest.  C'mon. C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha-- C'mon. C'mon. Give me Pengin! C'mon! Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin. God damn it, you're supposed to trade, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!  You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon? Oh, please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday. Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle. It's all Chinpokomon now. You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?  Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master! Duhhh! Duhhh! Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.  Cool!

Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?! Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!  The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power. Oh, my God, that's so yesterday! Like, eight days ago. Get outta the way! Move it! Ohhh. Is this cool or not? I can't tell. Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana.  Minna-san! Kite kite, churi...  ...Gay. Gay. Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.

Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys. Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.  That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that. No, Fonics Monkey!  You're damn straight, he did. Now you're gettin' it. Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal! Oh, dude, this is not cool! No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard. Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!  Whoa, cool. Totally! Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin. Oh. We don't know him. Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one?   K-kill me. No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him. Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers. Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off. Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this?  Oh, my God, ''this'' guy again.  Oh! Aww!  Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house! Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off?  No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries. Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this?  Ey! I'm the leader of Earth! Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true!  No, never. It's perfect. Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait! Forget him! He's done for!  No, no, he's done for. Come on!  U-u-huh. I don't remember. Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one.  Holy shit! It's Sally Struthers! Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers! Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now.  Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you.  She bought it. Wait. I remember. It was the ''red'' button!  Alright, Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh. What? We're not gonna come visit him. T'heh, whatever.  Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore! I'm playing the drum. You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  That's how you ''rock'', dude. I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks! Ey, I'll get it! Yes I will! Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damn it! What? No way! Flutes are totally gay! Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Later.  Good morning, gentlemen. Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time. Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did. Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win. Yes we are! Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month. Right. Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield.  Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!  Hooray for the South! But why? Why should they get the bell? But we don't ''have'' to lose.  God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!  So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?   Perhaps we should ''take'' Topeka. They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah. No. I say we take Topeka.  I'll bet you can't.  I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!  Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be ''my'' slaves for a month. Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.  Excuse meh.  Where did the Confederates go, son? Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.  Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.  Where are you going? We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!   No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?! God, I hate you guys! This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot!  Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.  Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take. Yes! Yes! Take the fort! Suck my ass! We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up. I knew they would! Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.! I don't. I made it up.  What the hell are you guys doing?! What?! No! We still have to fight! NOOO!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH! Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit! Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave. The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished! Hahahaha haa ha! Hey, what the hell are you doing?! <poem><i>Jews...</i></poem> <poem><i>...play stupid games.</i></poem> <poem><i>Jews...</i></poem> that's why they're lame. It's sooo amazing!

Guess what? I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys!  Yes! I really did. Well, because yesterday I got my period.  My ''period'', you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month. Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!  You did? Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear. Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny? Tampon? What's a tampon? Ew, doesn't that hurt? Wow, cool! All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers. Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!   Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind? Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?! And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool. Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first. What's the matter, Kyle? ...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too. Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us.  Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet. Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew. Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go. Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she- Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has- Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!  Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there. Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas.  That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long. Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh.  That was pretty cool.  No? How about this?  Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this?  We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control. That's a scientific term for crapping your pants. Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II! How about this one, Kenny?  That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.  Stan, what's a queef? Of ''course'' we know what a queef is, you queef! Aaaa-  Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it! I ''told'' you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise." "An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does ''that'' mean? How about geebo, or, or mung? Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.  You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys! The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?  I ''told'' you guys! That they should bring back ''Chicago Hope'' for another season? Totally. Ooooh. They ''should'' bring back another season of ''Chicago Hope'' though, seriously. Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this.  Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys. Uh-oh.  Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay? (That sounds fucking screwed.) <i>[the others laugh]</i> (Woohoo!) <i>[the boys look at him]</i> (I mean, 'Oh...') <i>[looks down]</i> (My name’s Kenny.) (No, Kenny.) (KENNY!) <i>[to Kelly]</i> (Argh! That's not true.) <i>[in bliss]</i> (Uh-huh.) <i>[Kelly picks her nose again]</i> (Yeah, I think so.) <i>[stops]</i> (Yeah. Everything is fine.) (Okay.) (Really?!) (Oh, that's great!) (That's ''not'' good?) <i>[pissed]</i> (Aaaargh!)  (Well, I like you-)  (Oh, God damn it!) (Kelly, you said it!)  (Okay. I can do that.)   (How about this?) (I know, fucking seriously!) (Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.) (Yeah, dude. She saved me.) (Ach.)  Uh, no. {Maybe he took a dump and got sick.}  {And a real huge dick.}  (Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.) (And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!) (That's what that means!)  (Here you go.)  (Hey you guys, wait up for me!)  (Woohooo!)  (Woohooo!)  (Hey guys, what's going on with you?) (Bye, ladies.)  (I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!) (Sure you can.)  (Why?) (You don't?) (Shop class?)  (No, I won't!) (I don't wanna take shop class!)  (Hi, Mr. Adler.) (Hey!)  (Hey!) (Hey, God damn it!) (Ugh!) (Richard.) (Woohoo!) (You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!)  (Argh--!) (Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?) (What's that?) (Oh, that's alright.) (Really?)  (Aw.) (Yeah.) (Woohoo!) (Squirts?) (Oh.) (Uh huh.) (Uh huh!) (Uh huh?) (How do you do ''that''?) (Kenny McCormick.) (What's that?)  (''Nahit chaim.'')  (Hah! Oh my God!) (What the fuck are we doing?) (Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)  (What's happening now?) ('''''What the fuck is that?!''''') (Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?) (What?!)  (I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.) (What?!) (Oh no!) (Stop!)  (Shit!)  (Aghh!) (Haaarrrrrh!)  (Huh?) (Aww.) ) (Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!) (Woohoo!)  (Ow!)  (Ow!) (It's okay, I'll use my head!)  (Heeeeeyah! Ugh--!)  (You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)  (Hoh!) (Yeah!) (Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!) (Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?)  (Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)   (Awww.) (What the hell? What the fuck is this?!)  (Nuh uh.)  (Nuh uh!) (No!) (No!) (No! This is mine!) (Fuck you!) (Hey, you guys...)  (Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)  (Heey.)  (Hey, Cartman, help me.) (Huh?)  (To pay for the pockets on his peehole)  (Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.) (You guys, just fly away!) (Oh my God, I get it.)  (Flutes are gay?) (Woohoo!)  (What?!) (...What?) (Me too.)  Woohoooo!)  (You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own ''period''!) (Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)  (Woo-hoo!) (No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.) (See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.) (A little.)  (Dammit, here!) (Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.) (And mine too.) (Ooooowwwwwwwhh.)  (Oh- ooowww!) (Aaaaaa!)  (Uh-uh.) (Nope.) (Nuh-uh.) (I don't know!) (Yeah.) (Ready.) ) <i>[steps forward]</i> Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year? Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day? I wish we could have seen the Yanagopa. Wow, look at the pretty flower.  Aaaah. Ugh, help! <i>[steps forward]</i> That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen <i>[Kenny sees her and begins to swoon]</i> is made in the rainforest. <i>[smiles back at him. Kenny's in love - ahem, distracted. The camera stays on him]</i> Lenny? Johnny? Oh. <i>[looks away and picks her nose.]</i> <i>[picks her nose]</i> Your family isn't poor? <i>[picks her nose]</i> Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh? <i>[walks over to Kenny, her partner]</i> Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny? Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? <i>[takes a picture]</i> <i>[walking behind Kenny]</i> Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay? That's good. Can I tell you something? I think I like you. <i>[holds his shoulder]</i>  Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well. <i>[looks away]</i> No, that's not good. No. See, if I start to like you too much, <i>[looks away]</i> I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. <i>[looks at him again]</i> Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. <i>[grabs him and gets emotional]</i> And that would devastate me. <i>[lets go]</i> So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! <i>[walks away]</i> Benny, will you hold my hand? <i>[picks her nose. When she lowers her hand, Kenny grabs it, but she looks away]</i> I don't want to get emotionally attached, though. We are? Me, too! <i>[the rest start to groan]</i>  I hate the rainforest!   Oh, but I do like you.  Oh, but you're only going to leave me.  Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care!  Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens! Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day. Aaaah! Lenny! No!   Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?! Who's "they"?! Well don't just stand there, help him!! Aaagh!  Shut up, fatass! Hey, Craig. Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes. You can't do that! <i>[Cartman's jaw drops]</i> Thanks! Fuck off, Cartman! <i>[alarmed]</i> No! That's a stereotype. God-damn, it's hot out here! No, dude. That's a branch. No. That's the same branch again. What's the Yanagopa? My guess would be yes. Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here! Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back. Um, no. Rainforests suck! I wanna go home! <i>[Kyle runs into an adult]</i> Aaaaa! There's a dude here! <i>[a soldier holding a shotgun]</i> I want two tostadas and mild sauce. Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here. Hey! Yeah. It happened once before. Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people.  What the hell? Yeah! Fragile my ass! Dude! Bulldozers rule! You bastards! They're... they're bastards. What? Whoa, dude! No, I don't think so. No, that's a hair dryer! Yeah. Do you have any "nurections"? I need to get a nurection for my dad. Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom. You bastards! Yeah.  Well, I'm Jewish. I guess not. Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs! We'll do it! We'll do it! Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan? He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend. This is gonna be fun. You're too fat to be Jesus! Stan should be Jesus. You're such a fat baby! All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby! Die! | I don't know you, dude. Hey, that went really well. They really liked it. Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds! Yeah. That looks pretty good. Yeah, me too. Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days. Then I can give it to my dad.  Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection. Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad. How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?! Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap!  We ''know'' how to fart, Mr. Mackey! Jesus Christ!  Dude, I think you pooed a lot. God, that was ''not'' cool at all, dude! Yeah. We're having him resurrurected. Sick! It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this. Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too. Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak. Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up!  She's not worried about you. How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I ''kick your ass''! Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.  Yeah, take that! ...Oh, yeah. Sorry. Dude, those people are pissed! Where's your dad? Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help ''my'' dad. Dude, that was ''Star Trek'' again. "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was ''Wrath of Khan.'' She's upstairs. Really? Great! I don't have to worry about ''that'' anymore.  Well, my dad is, too. I forgot all about him.  Wow! Dude! You're still alive, Cartman? I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today? Yeah.  Oh, here he comes. Why? Dude, just ask Chef for help. He ''always'' knows what to do. Mr. Derp? Dude! I ''hate'' Mr. Derp!  Shut up, Cartman! Yeah, but we didn't believe them. Moving ''in''?! But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better. This... is insane.  That bitch! He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man. Yeah, so? Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around. Good idea. They said that Chef works in one of these buildings  Dude! Just take them off! He's a big guy, with a beard. We need you, Chef. Chef, this place isn't you! No way, dude! Chef should be here any minute.  I can't believe it! All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball! Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, ''Chef!'' Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you? All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off? That's it! This is totally what's happening! Thanks, Mr. Garrison. Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus. Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him. There he is!  We ''have'' to talk to him! What's tree-fitty? Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus! Well, you are taking Chef from us.   This is not a woman! It is a succubus!  Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody! I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us. Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power." I don't know. Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? <poem><i>There's got to be a morning after.</i></poem>  In three hours. Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open.  He's asleep. Wake up fatass!  Bitch. Dirty bitch. Now, Cartman!!  Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!!  You bastard! It's great to have you back Chef! This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Just go behind a tree. Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen! You just squat, stupid!  Watch out for ground eels!  What do you have to ''think'' about? No way, dude! What?  Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it! Over here! It just ran by here a second ago.   It's stupid. You don't like anything, Cartman!  Did you smoke some of your mom's crack? What are we supposed to do with him?  Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?! What are you doing, fatass?! They want you to have sex, God-damnit!! Shut up!! Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby. Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was.  Gross! Dude, this sucks ass! We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.  That must be of the antelope family. Cartman! Wait! Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something. Mr. Adler? Yeah, you are! You ''always get in trouble''.  Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we ''should have'' taken home ec. Do you wanna bet? Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him?  There. Did you see? He just flipped you off. So, do you agree to fight him after school? We'll see! Yeah. That's not cool, dude.  Tweek and Craig are gonna fight. What? Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!   Tweek? Well, Craig showed up. And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it! Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya.  He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked! Shut up, fatass!! That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass! Tweek's gonna fight Craig! Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy. No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby.  How??  Not like that! Fine! Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm! Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low. This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek. Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him! Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear ''that''? Craig just called you a boner!  We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight. You bastards! Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other.  Boy, do we ever. Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters. About what?  This is freaking me out, dude.  Dude! He got a lawyer? Dad?! It's... big. Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?  And you don't see a problem with that? You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you? I've ''tried'' talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money. Hey, what about that stupid panda?  Huh? Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough? Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!  Hoh God, here we go. Isn't that fascism? Do you? What?? You bastards!  Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all! '''''No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume!'''''  Okay, sorry, sorry. That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.   Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had. Hoh, dude, weak. Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me.  I'm coming, Ma!   Oh! Hey, Kenny. I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee. It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure. Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard. Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me? ...Oh. Kenny isn't special? Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to. Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight. No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform! No, Ike! I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts. What? You want me to lie? Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun-- Wow, cool. He was huge.  Who are you? You have to go with him, Ike. Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building.  Kyle Broflovski. Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg. This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting. That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand.  This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up.  Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle. This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee. It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!    Don't worry. I know what to do. Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish. He doesn't get cake? Dude, what the hell is going on?! Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us. Kenny will find a way. Go, Ike! What is that? Look!  Kenny! Noooooo! Kenny!  You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass. Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.  Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.  The what? Nuh-uh. Yeah! Let's see how ''they'' like it! That's not scary, fatass! He must have a ''huge'' bone in his ass, then.  Yeah, fatass, a dead body. Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary! Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma?? Are you insane?! Dude! We're not digging up ''my'' grandma; I'll get in trouble.  Naww, let's dig up somebody else.  Wait. I don't know if this is cool. I don't think my mom would want me doin' this. I don't really care, dude. Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.  Aaaah! Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny! Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back! How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them? Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect! Cartman?! Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads. Shouldn't we hide her better than that? Wait till you guys see ''my'' costume! It's gonna be sweet! No Grandma??  She's not here! Well, she's ''not'' here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again! God-damnit! ''Now'', what the hell are we gonna do?! Somebody took my dead grandma. Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.  Then, you'll help us? Right.  Wow! That was easy. Whoa. What was that? Yeah! Where's Grandma?   What are those? Huh? No, but look. I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll. Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore? Why the hell don't people tell me these things?! What's the Primary Main Objective? Well, what's the Evil Power? What?  Shit!  Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon? I'm not sure. I don't know. Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon. Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass. Thanks. Neither do I.   Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll! What?  Huh? No. Damnit!   Camp?   Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight? What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen? God damnit!  ...our hearts.  ...Power. Destroy it? Liberace gay. Owatta Beikoku!  But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master! What? Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master! So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't? But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya.  Aw, screw it; I'm too confused.  Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while. Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you. What's a "home-schooled kid"?  What?? Definition? Uh, could you use it in a sentence? "Krocsyldiphic." "Krocsyldiphic." C  Damnit!  Wooww.  Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home? ...Uuh, can I talk to her? U-u-uh, hi.  Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all.  ...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet. Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance! What?? Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school. Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um, Huh? Uuuh, okay.  Gah! Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go. You will? No no. I mean, go with me. You got my note? Uh, can we sit down? Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there? Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us. From public school, ''your'' house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study Love, for one thing. Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss. When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together. Rebecca, in public school,  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy. I'm not completely sure. No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right.  Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?  I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up. Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams! ''You'' suck! Rebecca. You... Uh. All I did was show her how to-  Aaaah! Ooww! No it wasn't, fatass! I saw ''you'' do it! Relax, fatass. You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls! Cartman! Good job, fatass! Why would ''anybody'' send this asshole money?  Yeh-hah.  Starvin' Marvin! He ''did'' take a ship. I think he wants us to get in. Let's go somewhere.  Yes! No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too. Oh, my God! What the hell is ''that'' thing?!   Where are we? This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.  Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar. Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'. Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there.  Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do! No!  Oh, no, dude!  I ''told'' you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass! Watch out! Here I come! Kenny! Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home! What was that?  Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar. Well, how'd we do it last time?? Which button did you press, Cartman?? You don't remember?! Yeah, now finish 'em off!  Where did ''that'' come from?? Sorry, Marvin. We tried. It's pulling us in!  Marvin...   Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for ''their'' marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars. Thanks. No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth. Cartman, what the hell are you doing? Well, you ''have'' to hit it softer! You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat! Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow! Cartman!!!  Give me the drum, and you play the flute. You dick! He'll show. Wow, dude! Your grandpa ''still'' isn't dead? Yeah! You're dressed up like the South. The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war! No they're not, stupid! How much do you wanna bet?! Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?! And if the North wins you're our slave for a month?? You're on! Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War. What do we do?! You cheated, Cartman! Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have ''known'' that! They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop. I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do ''we'' have to wait around for them to come back? Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves?? We have to stop him, dude. We'll give you 10 bucks. You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves! Hey! Yeah. Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno- We'll never stop them now. Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States. Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year. Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off!  Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month! What?? Yeah. Thanks, dick! Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?  Hey, shut your mouth, fatass! <poem><i>Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>I made you out of clay.</i></poem> <poem><i>Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>with dreidel I shall play.</i></poem> <poem><i>Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.</i></poem> <poem><i>Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.</i></poem> <poem><i>Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>I made you out of clay.</i></poem> <poem><i>Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>with dreidel I shall play.</i></poem> <poem><i>Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>I made you out of clay.</i></poem> <poem><i>Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>with dreidel I shall play.</i></poem> Hi, Mom! <poem><i>Oh, hi Dad.</i></poem> <poem><i>Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>I made you out of clay.</i></poem> <poem><i>reidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>with dreidel I shall play.</i></poem> <poem><i>Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>I made you out of clay.</i></poem> <poem><i>Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,</i></poem> <poem><i>with dreidel I shall play.</i></poem> Dad?

See you next year. I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives! What, fatass?! You got your what? Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right!  Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out ''my'' ass. Dude, did you get your period yet? Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty. Yeah. You got ''your'' period too, Kenny? Ike, can I talk to you?  Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't! Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore. Yeah! I could just ''say'' I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just ''say'' I got my period, 'cause I really ''will'' get it someday! It's not ''really'' lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.  Thanks a lot, Ike!  You guys! I got my period, too! Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place. Awesome! We get powers?  Here. I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde. Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m. Nothing. Um  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.  Phew.  Hormones? Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones. Whoa, dude!  Hey, here comes Stan. Did you get your period yet, Stan?  How do know that?  Shut up, fatass! Cartman, what the hell are you doing? Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants! Nuh-uh! There is no brown noise, fat boy!  Who the hell are ''these'' guys? Yeah! That's Texas, butthole! Kenny? Alright, dickhole!  Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere!  Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef. What's it mean?! What's it mean?! Awwgh! Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means. Yeah. That'll make 'em look ''stupid''! How about... finkleroy? Mung's good. Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh? Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up!   Eewww. Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists! What the hell is that lady talking about? Yeah. They think they're so cool. Calm down, Cartman.  I don't believe it! That's amazing. Yeah, dude! We ''have'' to watch them! We can't miss it! This is gonna be sweet! Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time- Well, that whole experience sure did suck. Huh? Oh, no! Huh? Choirs suck. It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing. What?! But we don't even ''care'' about the rainforest. <i>[As Sharon drags him to the bus]</i> Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please! Nooo-ho! <i>[The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]</i> No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right. Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. <i>[Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle]</i> <i>[sees a branch]</i> Aaah! Snake! Oh. <i>[sees it again]</i> Aaah! Snake! Oh. AAAAAAA! <i>[hides behind a girl]</i> SNAAAKE! <i>[all see and gasp]</i> AAAAAAA! <i>[runs farther back]</i> <i>[lifts some away]</i> I'm just a-scared of snakes. Dude! Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!! I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme. This doesn't look very safe. Hey. Maybe Cartman was right. Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke?  Holy crap!  Jesus Christ! We're sinking. All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"! Oh, ''now'' she figures it out. Wow! Oh my God! They killed Kenny! ''They'' did.  You know, "they." Help ...him?  Is this what you're looking for, Kyle? Why is ''that'' funny? That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! He just... ignited. Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on. Wow, that was short.  The what? I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible. Dad, where's our Bible? Or else what? ...What?  Where's our Bible? Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death? ...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection.  Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets. Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight. Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate. Station Two: Jesus takes his cross. And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him.  Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross.   Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks." And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrection three days later. This spot looks good.  Okay, cool. See you, Cartman. Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess. Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection. Whoa, dude, my dad's famous. Wow, he died. Cartman?? Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus. Sick, dude! Okay, okay, just go away!  Uh. We've been taking care of him. Apples? Dude! I don't think I like this new law. Yeah. Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to ''my'' dad! Dude, he's still not dead. That's not your mom calling! He is right. It ''has'' been getting really hot lately. Hey, yeah!  Dad, where's the phone book? Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect? Oh. Uh, it... sucks ass. Oh my God, what's going on? Dude, that's my dad! I know, huh? He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do. What are you doing, dad? No, he's not. He can't even get an erection. Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution! Well, ''that'' doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross. See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few." It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime.  Huh? Uh, well, Bible, ''Wrath of Khan'', what's the difference? Dad. Dad!  Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!  See? My dad ''is'' the coolest after all. Cartman! He's been up there for like, three weeks. That's amazing! Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body? Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.   Why do you have to see an eye doctor? Where's Chef? Why did Chef quit?  Could you just hand us some food please? Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back. Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today. But why? Why would you quit? So you made sweet love to her down by the fire. Talked?!  That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?! What the hell is going on?! She's stealing Chef from us. Wait you guys.  ...Yeah, screw that bitch. Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow. We wanna talk to Chef. And a chef hat. Huh? Chef, you have to dump the bitch! But we don't like her. I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.  Dude! He bailed on us! Come on! We're going to his house!   You forgot! Oh no! No nononononono! Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time. What's a succubus? Yeah! Wow, you ''are'' smart, Mr. Garrison! Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him.  Who are you? Chef, we have to talk to you! You're Chef's parents? No, that's okay. He wanted money? Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?  Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman. Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us. We know what you are, lady! A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men! I guess. Jesus dude!  Excuse me!  Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him Chef, but- No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us! Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to ''stop'' them. Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus. What the hell does ''that'' mean? Right. Yeah? Oh-hoho! That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards. We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  God-damnit! You can't fall asleep. There she is!   Bitch. Bitch. Bitch.  All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.  Here it goes. Now, Cartman!  Come on Cartman! Oh my God! She killed Kenny!  We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!  We'd love them! Where are you going? So? You can poo in the wilderness. Not here! Go further away! Sick, dude!  We don't wanna ''look'' at it, Cartman! I see it!  I saw it this way! Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way! I think his name is Junjun. Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends? Wow!  No, he's annoying. Why don't we just tell our parents?  Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.  Sh! Keep quiet, stupid! Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond? God-damn!  Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?  Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing. Dude, it's crowded in here. Oh, no! ''Nothing's'' worse than Cartman with authoritah! Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.  Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that. Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is. Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?  Tweek is! Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls. I don't know. He's such a wuss. No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss. How much? You're on! Hey Tweek. Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight. Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight? He's really got it out for you, dude. Super. See you there.  Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler! The bell rang. Can we go? Come on, you guys.  This is gonna be so sweet, dude. You're on, fatass!  How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny? Aw, hell! Tweek? How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?! Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!" Yeah, it was weak. Tomorrow? Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45. Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go. Well? Huh?  Aw, dude, come on!!  All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight. All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig. Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box! Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow! Damn it! Okay, the time has finally come.  You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on! Ye-hah! Come on, Tweek! You got him! Yeah. Here they are. Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching.  Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig. Hey, you guys. How are you feeling? Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you. So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies.   Well, I mean, that's what was on the news. Come on, Tweek! You got him! Ohh, dude, get me ''out of'' here! You would think that, you little ass-sucker. An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker. What? No you can't, you little ass-sucker! Hoh, whatever!  I called you an ass-sucker! What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time! Wwhat do you mean? Uh... I'm eight? Huh? I have to give him half my stuff? Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy. Uh, no! I hate that toy! Damnit! Where's our desks?  You see, Cartman? You see what this has done? Bad. Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits? Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!  'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please. We want Sexual Harassment Panda. Well, where is he?! What the hell is wrong with these people?!  'Scuse me. Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here. ...Coats? Dude, what the hell is going in?! Well, we don't take kindly to you! Come on, we'd better hurry.   Whoa! Who are you? ...Thanks a lot, dude. Have you seen any panda bears? Oh my God! They killed Kenny! Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick! Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.  Okay, you are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a ''new'' message. A new message that people will find useful again.  No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say. I don't want to go to this stupid party! No, ''you'' guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels. Awww! I don't ''wanna'' hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody  Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!  No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school! Shut up, Pip. Butters, is there any way out of here? Oh my God. No.  Yes.  Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me. Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!  What?  What do I have to do? Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.  What, Pip? What the hell do you want?! You did?  We're going upstairs. Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs!   Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set. I don't care, just hurry!  Rad!  There are no more missions. I have everything I want.   Just... play something else! God! Whoa, cool!  Dude! That's this house. They think ''our'' parents are the religious cult!   Mom, go look outside. Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves.  We don't have any weapons. Get back inside!   Dad! Dad, they shot at us. Mom!  Get a hold of yourself, man! Come on. We have to find out what's happening.  Sh! We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party. Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real.  Tell them not to burn us down.  Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters. You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job.  Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters? We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there.  Can you hit a target, Pip? Hit something nice and solid now.  Nice job, Pip. Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn.  He made it down.  But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along. You?! You think ''you'' had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins! Super weak. This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt.  ''Christ''mas? W-we weren't scared! That's just an old legend. I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare ''them''! Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary. Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts!   Come on, fatass, we have to go! Yes you can, porky.  Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders. What's the scariest thing we could get? No!  A dead body. We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.  We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.  Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right? All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone, Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to. Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted! Well, let's dig 'er up!  Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary! You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?! Yes you do! Now, dig!  Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.  Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh. Okay, grab the sled.  Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders. Who was that? Dude, not cool. This is scary.  Hay, you're that band KoRn. What are you guys doing out here? Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders. Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.  Yeah, dude. It's right over there. Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes.  Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!   Where's your costume, fatass? Hey, Kenny.  This is gonna be sweet What's the problem? She ''has'' to be here!  We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away. Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside. How should we split up? This place gives me the creeps. We've got to hide! Ow! There she is! Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back!  Boo! Hey, fatass. Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe. What are these? They're Chinpokomon! Yeah, like ancient history. No, dude! Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective. The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.  Ogh..! Yeah, get with the times, dude.  Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller? Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!  How's it goin', fat ass? What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp? We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure.  Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp. You didn't know that? Dude, did you just say "a-ight"? Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore. Can you see anything?  It's starting, it's starting! Juuhachi desu ka?  ''Juuhachi'' is eighteen, Garrison-san. He said, "Garrison-san sabuchii da naa." Yeah, dude. That was totally gay. Totally gay. Kore wa watashi no uchi desu.  Nan da kore?  What? You like it?  Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something.  Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?  Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore. No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused. ...Ye-eah. Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes. Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards? What the..?  I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before.   Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart. We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something? What's that? Shut up, Cartman? You shut up,  gaywad! No, we're friends. What? Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos. Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground. You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass. Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me." No! I'm gonna hit you if you ''don't'' say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you. All right.  Alright, we'll try this again, Pip. Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own.   Aw, man, if you have to. Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now.  Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff. Ah, dude, you don't say ''that''. Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling. Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going? Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid! But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole. Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny! Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole. Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!  Oh, brother!  You suck now, Kyle!  Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle! Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark.  Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark?   Nice speech, nerdo. What?? * I told you, fatass. Sshh! We don't know.   Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV. Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news. Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing. Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!  Wow! This is great! Yeah, that's better. Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world.  What the hell did you hit, Cartman?!  We're on like, some foreign planet. Uh, thanks. U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth. Cool! Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!  Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here. Uuh. Thanks. Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar. What?? Oh.  Run for it! He's not done for, he's standing right there. Alright, we made it! They're shooting at us. Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself. You dumbass, Cartman! You got 'em, Marvin. Sally Struthers is saving us! Now's our chance! We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.  Wow! Good job, dude! Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again. Maybe we'll come and visit sometime. Dude! I know, but you don't tell him that! Ready? 1-2-3-4.  That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer! Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4.  Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute! Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment.  He'd better! Dude, that's not cool. Cartman, what the hell are you doing? You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass! Hoohoo what a dumbass! It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave. Cartman, you can't do that! Run for your life, dude!  Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the ''war''! And the South ''still'' didn't win the ''war'', dipshit! Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas. Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back? ''What'' battlefield?!  God dammit, that fat piece of shit! That would suck so much ass. I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters? Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.  Mom wants you to come home. Oh, my God! They killed Kenny! I know! But we'll have to wait until dark. There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home. Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.  Haha! You lose, fatass! Where are you going?  Oh, no.  Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here. No, you can't do that. Our dads are there. Aw, dammit! Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves. Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do? Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy. Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.  It's finally over, Cartman. You lost! Don't touch me.  Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is- Awwww! Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton! <poem><i>I'll try to make it spin.</i></poem> <poem><i>It fell; I'll try again.</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try</i></poem> <poem><i>to make it spin.</i></poem> <poem><i>It fell;</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try again.</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try</i></poem> <poem><i>It fell,</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try again.</i></poem>}}</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try</i></poem> <poem><i>to make it spin.</i></poem> <poem><i>It fell;</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try again.</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try</i></poem> <poem><i>to make it spin.</i></poem> <poem><i>It fell,</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try again.</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try</i></poem> <poem><i>to make it spin.</i></poem> <poem><i>It fell,</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try again.</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try</i></poem> <poem><i>to make it spin.</i></poem> <poem><i>It fell,</i></poem> <poem><i>I'll try again.</i></poem> AAAA!  Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome. No you didn't! How do you know? You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period? Please, it's important. Dude, Cartman ''can't'' hit puberty before us. Hello? No, there's no blood coming out of ''my'' ass. Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways. Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's. So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?  You did? Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan  Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!  I'm not bleeding out my aahass! No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.  Hey, Chef. Bad. Can I come in? Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't. No. Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't. Yeah, Cartman told us. Okay.  ...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time. But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it!  But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty. Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad. No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself. So do you know anything that can help him? Hormones?  Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best!    Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones! Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's! So what are we gonna do for New Year's?  Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.  Have I missed anything? No. I didn't, but-  Jesus, why does God hate me? He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me. Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted? What do you mean? I just wanted my period. I have it. I have the question.  <poem><i>Let's have a cup o</i></poem>-Aaaa!  What's Arkansas—is that a state? What's "lose bowel control?" Who's Karen Carpenter? Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting.  We're not rednecks! Why?! Don't ''you'' know?!  Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again! Damnit!  You did?  Damnit Cartman, wha-?! Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading!  Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means. No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a ''great'' idea. Let's make up our ''own'' word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em. What word could we make up? No, uhno, not finkleroy. Yeah, mung. Sh. Here they come.  You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung? We busted you!  It is? Ooogh. You dumbass, Cartman! I have no idea. I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids. You found what?  No way.  Dude, are you thinking what ''I'm'' thinking? No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids. How do we write the note, Cartman? Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  That should do it. Okay, let's get back to the room.  Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants. Oh no, dude. Look!  Stop! Stop!  Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means.   Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here. Uuuuh... You do? <i>[behind the door]</i> I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man! <i>[The camera is now inside]</i> You get sent here every day, Craig! I know. Why can’t you behave? What do you have to say for yourself?! <i>[nothing]</i> Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- <i>[Craig sticks his right middle finger up]</i> Did you just flip me off? Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- <i>[Craig flips Mr. Mackey off again]</i> There! You just flipped me off again! Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! <i>[Craig hops off the chair as the door opens. The boys enter.]</i> Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. <i>[Craig exits]</i> Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation- Uh, young man, "Getting Gay With Kids" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors. Well, guess what, boys? I think that "Getting Gay With Kids" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you. I think this will be very good for you <i>[writes their names down]</i> And that's exactly why you need to go! <i>[rushing in]</i> Sorry I'm late. Oh, no problem. <i>[to El Presidente and his men]</i> Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien? Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour. <i>[approaching]</i> Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente) Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?) Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...) Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llega- llegarán. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.) No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estarán aquí. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.) Estoy seguro que llegarán. Eh-sólo poquito más de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time) Mbien. Hi, boys. Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust? Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay?  I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night.  So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay?  Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay. Uh, Your Honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass. Mhm, mkay?  Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm. Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.   We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts.  Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.  Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week. Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub. Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy? Hm huheh, that's okay.  Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay?  Would you like a meteor mai tai? Well, are you sure you have to leave so early? Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay?  Uh this is Cher. This is her new album. Only one? M'kay, that sounded great, kids.  M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas. Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay?  M'kay.  What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas? Well, don't you want to see them? Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay?  Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family? When was that? M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy?  Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay? M'kay. Mr. Garrison, are you alright? M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay? M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father. M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?! What did you say?! Why, you son of a bitch!  I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?!  Yuh-NO!  You may have won this time, Mr. Hat. M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move! Excuse me? Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?  Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.? Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay. Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay. Eh, you didn't? Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different. Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about "sexual molestation", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality. I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him. There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, "How far will I go to save my son's life?" Well, I've said all I can say.  Uh, aren't those our boys?   ...I don’t know. No. No I didn’t. No. No. He did? Why would he say that?  Well, I've gotta go over there and- Okay.  ''Red Racer's'' on. I ''do'' watch ''Red Racer'' every day of the week! Nope.  What?! What did he say about Stripe?! That son of a bitch, I'll kill him! After ''Red Racer''. Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow. Some kid. Yeah, don't just "Oh" me! I uh...  What do we do? I've never been in a fight before. Meatloaf? Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop! How can I resist an ass so great? This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master.  Okay. Okay, okay! Respect my authority. Ugh. What was on the news? Huh? I'm gonna kick your ass! This girl touched my thigh. Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me. Incriminate. Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball. Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out! Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!  Enjoying your lunch, nerdo? Get him!  Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole. That's the point, buttpipe.  Oh my God!  No! He's my friend! Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest. Oh, I didn't realize. It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.  I'm just kidding. Why? Kyle.  We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.   Behold, the miracle of childbirth! It looks quite inviting. No hot tub for me! Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle? Kyle! Go get the door, Kyle! ...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...''special'' thing. No, no, you're ''very'' special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids.  Kyle, eh, the problem is... Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts! You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout. Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there.  And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid." Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it. Ike, you behave! Oh my God, what is that?!  This retreat really ''is'' out of the way, isn't it? I'm sure they are. Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny? Try and act Jewish.  Hold on, kids.  Yes? Eehh, sure, come in.  What is it? Defiled? How? Dug her up? Why?? What?! Hoh, dear God!  Oooh.  O-o-o-o-oh! Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it! O-o-ogh!   People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong? Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body! What's a Chinpokomon? Well, why do you need one? ...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll. Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did. Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them. Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be? But what toy? How? Kyle, it's over! Hello, boys! Oh, how precious! You boys are all playing dreidel. Now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people. <poem><i>to make the dreidel spin </i></poem> <poem><i>You'll know </i></poem> <poem><i>our people always win.</i></poem> <poem><i>Now when you learn</i></poem> <poem><i>to make the dreidel spin </i></poem> <poem><i>You'll know </i></poem> <poem><i>our people always win.</i></poem> <poem><i>Keep spinning: learn</i></poem> <poem><i>to make the dreidel spin</i></poem> <poem><i>You'll know</i></poem> <poem><i>our people always win.</i></poem> We'll talk about this later, Gerald! <poem><i>Now when you learn</i></poem> <poem><i>to make the dreidel spin</i></poem> <poem><i>You'll know</i></poem> <poem><i>our people always win.</i></poem> <poem><i>Keep spinning: learn</i></poem> <poem><i>to make the dreidel spin</i></poem> <poem><i>You'll know</i></poem> <poem><i>our people- know our people always win.</i></poem> Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. <i>[tosses him into the bus]</i> You have fun, Stanley. Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol. Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment.  Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut. Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear. Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.   Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet. Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment! Whoopee!  Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town! Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party? Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things. I'm watching one of Stanley's ''Chinpokomon'' video tapes. Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values.  I don't know what the hell they're talking about. This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what? Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff! No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what ''Battle of the Network Stars'' did to an entire generation. We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel. You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.  My son hasn't made any sense in days. So, what are we going to do about our children?  Ahhh, hello-o? Of course! That's a great idea! Stan? Stan, it's Mommy!  Stanley--  --you need to come home right now. Mommy misses you. Stanley, I'm talking to you!  Stan, please, come home! No, it's not okay! What? Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis! Oh!   Come on! We don't have much time!  That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  You bet, Stanley!  Stanley, honey, what's the matter? Well, that's good, honey. Stanley.  What should we ask him? <i>[Kenny sits next to her]</i> My name's Kelly. Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography. <i>[with heavy accent]</i> What are chu looking at, man? Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture? <i>[long pause]</i> ¿Qué? <i>[long pause]</i> ¿Qué? ¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest. Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla. <i>[Pablo appears]</i> <i>[long pause]</i> ¿Qué? <i>[on stage]</i> Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.) <i>[the worker moves along]</i> ¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?) ¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!) ¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderán este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!) ¡¿Dónde putos está el coro?! ¡El espectáculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!) La gente está ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.) Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos.  (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)  ¿A cuántos Polacos les toma a manejar a Panamá? (How many Pollacks does it take to eat a burrito? Two. How many Pollacks does it take to drive to Panama?) This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage. <i>[turns and stops the group]</i> The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it. Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. <i>[one sits in a tree, resting]</i> Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest. And here is a three-toed sloth. <i>[hangs from a branch with all four legs]</i> <i>[standing next to the snake wrapped around a tree trunk]</i> Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature. What's the matter, little boy? Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. <i>[the snake jumps out of the tree and wraps itself around him, suffocating him]</i> Oh!! <i>[the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls]</i> Agh. YEAH! Honh. <i>[she presses the play button, and the song plays. The kids begin to dance]</i> HOORAY!! Hey, Chef. Okay!  Must collect Chinpokomon. Yay!!!  Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts! To destroy the Evil Power! Destroy it! Ichi, ni, san, shi! Ichi, ni, san, shi!  Beikoku!  Beikoku!  Beikoku! Nihon ima hajimaru!  Beikoku!  Beikoku!  Beikoku!  Beikoku!  Beikoku!  Beikoku!  So desu née.  Beikoku!  Beikoku!  Hai, shachou-san.  Alright!  Mmm-mmm. <poem><i>Howdy Ho!</i></poem> Howdy-ho! Howdy-ho! Howdy-ho! I’m not. Me. ¿Qué? <i>[crisp]</i> Who are you?! Enough! <i>[the music stops]</i> We're not getting gay with any kids, okay? Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi. <i>[the other men begin to laugh]</i> Now, get out of here before we kill you! <i>[the soldier next to him cocks his shotgun]</i> You white Americans make me sick! <i>[emphasizes his disgust with thumps on the table]</i> You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers. <i>[waving the choir away]</i> ¡Rápido, rápido! <i>[Kenny steps in front of Kelly to shield her from any shots coming their way]</i> We're here live in San José, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril. That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, "Getting Gay With Kids," all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment. What are you doing here, little boy? Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others? Chicken wings! Quick! Everybody help the children!  Come on! Let's get you back to civilization! Your little friend helped me out. We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard. You mean, you don't mind? That’s swell! Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick! Start the show! Start the show! Start the show! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Awww. Awww. Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! It's a great name, isn't it?  Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!  Good-bye! Hooray!  Awwww. Awww.  Ee-oooh! Awwwgh!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Aaaaaah!  Aaaaaah!  Oohh?! Churrah!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! We want God! We want God! We want God! We want God! Damtilié? Damtilié?  Damtilié! Damtilié! Damtilié! And now, here to teach us about the rainforest is Getting Gay With Kids.  That was so inspiring. What a wonderful message. May I help you find something? Any what? Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it.   What?  What happened? We love you, Randy. We love you, Randy. We love you, Randy.  Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come? Oh my God! Yes, Hope.  You guys come quick! I've only just heard! They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur!   Yea for us! Totally! Totally! Listen to her!  Hey, Richard. Remember me? That's sexual harassment. We'll give you anything you want. Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much. What? Excuse me, how is this helping? Down with KoRn! Devil worshipers!  Father Maxi? Ho-hoh. Oooh.   Nn * wohg *?  Aaaaa! ...We knew you could do it, Jesus!  Whoa, what is that??  Am I going to spontaneously combust? This is very scary.  Make love to me, Randy. Please!  Make love to me, Randy. Please! It's out of control.  Oh! What darling little children. Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.  Bonjour. Oui.  That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you ''pretty'' ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec. Richard, this is Grandma. Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools. I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously. You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all. Oh my God! The children have started suing adults. They could sue ''us'' next. We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go! We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again. Let's flip it over! Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus.  Hello-o.   Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him? That's right! This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus! Look, I can see him.   Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur… I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames. I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC. Is it contagious? Well, that's about it. Let's go. And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die.  Yeah! Yeah, that's right!  Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer! Yep. Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere! It's a UFO!  Hey! What's that guy doing?! Yeah. I hope it doesn't happen to me. Yeah.  Yup. Boy, that's one creeepy alien. Yeah. The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer. Right. Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before ''more'' people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park.  Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!  Exactly! Mayor. Why? Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park.  Shmuck! All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh? So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes. And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen?  My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more? Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it. Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why. All right, all right. Name your price. Done. Just find out what's happening. Boy, they're really pissed. Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me.  And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all.  ...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist. Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth. Wow. Or else what?  Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no. Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else. Exactly. Right. It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing? New girlfriend? Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.  What?! All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Do you feel hot? Damn it! How come you're not combusting?  No! Has she been doing anything odd? Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend. No! I think I might have it.  Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust. Wow.   The methane gathers here in the bowel area  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long. Exactly.  I am? I ''am'', huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!  You wanted to see me, Mayor? I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave. Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems. Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent. Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly.  Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up? Stan? Awww crap. Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.  Hey! Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.  Mr. Garrison, help me! I-I don't know what to say. Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me. Hm. Really? Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me. What? You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book. All right. Now, let's get to work. Wow!  ...Right, right right. Uh. Please, everyone-   Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer. It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny. I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow. No problem, Jakov. Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels? Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov. Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time. Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it. Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him. Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time. We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan. One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little. Yeah, experiment. Hell, we should get in. I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo! Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh? I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things. Good idea. Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me. Huh? Oh, you mean, this? Yeah. That, that was me. Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot. O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.  With two girls or two guys? You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have. ''No'', I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they? Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it? ...Well it is a night for experimenting. Okay, I'll start.   ...Yeah. No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right? Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing.  Um... Yeah yeah sure sure.  Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay? Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself. Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.  Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.  I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub. I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody ''could'' know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.  Well, of course we wouldn't.  Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?  What?! Why the hell would you do that?!  AAAW!!   Who?! Who who did you hear is, is gay?! Oh.   What the hell is that supposed to mean?! Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now? There's nothing to talk about. No, I-... I don't know. No! Will you stop it?! I don't... I just... Aaww!  Sharon, cuh can we go?  Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now. Ogh, I already did. Not now, Stanley.  Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?   God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows. What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-! It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is! You mean it? I'm not gay? Oh, I feel so much better! Wow! Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay! Lynch mob!   Here's their van! Here's their van! KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!  What are you doing? Why? ...Are those good moral values? I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all. Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.  My God, you're right.  Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys. Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is! Well, I guess that settles that. Chinpoko ga dai-suki yo!  Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1! Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool? Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves. Well, I'm sure glad this is all over. Uh, look, Mr.... Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own. Well, ''some''thing. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once. Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?   Alright men, fire!  Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down. Yeh-hah!  He took the bell!  Ow! That hurt!  Oh? Jimbo, have you lost your mind?! Alright, alright. We surrender.  Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.  All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka! Huh? Well, the Union be damned!  Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?! WHERE?!  Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!  We're out of s'more schnapps?  Oh, my head. Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us. Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here. Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff. Ey, that sounds fun.  What was that??  A whole year? Yeah, with our own eyes. We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?! That's God? The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays , the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy… Now, let us pray.  Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen.  Let's go- Broncos Let’s go Broncos Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately. You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you? Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night? It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ. Huh? Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys.  Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little "nervous" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh? Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, ''and'' things.  Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus! Do you, Chef, take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife, to have and to- And do you, Veronica, take Chef to be your daddy? And now a special sharing of vows through song. Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh! KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil! I ''know'' who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!  When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get! Whoa!   Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band! Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday! No. I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow! We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen. Nice guys.  Amen. Let’s go Broncos Broncos, let's go!  Hooray! Hooray!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! What?? Break!  Yeah!  O...  Aaaaaaaaaah! ''Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya<br />O Lord, Kumbaya'' Yeah!   Hooray! Aaaaah!  Puh-puuhh pirate ghost!  Nibblet!  Yeah. <poem><i>"Howdy ho ho, yum yum yum."</i></poem> <poem><i>It's Christ-mas-time in Hell!!!!</i></poem> <poem><i>One seems to hear words of good cheer<br />From everywhere filling the air.</i></poem> <poem><i>ing dong ding-dong, m'kay___</i></poem> Good night, Jerry. Helen, no! The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts.  Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say: What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch! See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen. Oh my God, another one. What happened? Bye, Jer- aaa!   How have we angered you, Lord? Me too. Wait, it's not a gun. It's a piece of paper. Yeah, you're Jesus. You're the one in control.  No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house. You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode? Go get him! Yeah. Phew.  Make love to me, Randy. Please!  Hi, Mr. Mackey. ''-the to on- [the tape balks and reverses to a halt]'' Hooray!  Hey, Chef! Hooray! Come on, Tweek! Sweet!  Ow, dude!  Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere? Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples. Yes. Apples.  Stinky apples. See you, boys.   You have to see the eye doctor, Eric. You're not fat, you're big-boned. There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor. Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not? Now, hon.   I'll think about it, hon. Mommy's busy, boopie-kins.  Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.  That's nice, muffin. Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best. Eric, this is for the best.  Eric, it's important for you to understand-.  The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs. I have to leave soon, Eric. Come down as soon as you're done.  Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly. All those other babysitters won't come back. Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears. Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.  Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay? Be good. Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses!  Eskimo kisses for Mom-my! Bye, kids.  No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors. This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up. Not really, hon.  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!  Hi, kids. I'm home.   Eric, your little friends are here. E-heric, it's only Halloween. I'm sorry, hon, Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, he's big-boned. Eric, calm down.  What is it, Eric?  I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric. Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon? Alright! let's go.  They're so strange. Where are they from? Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad. You have? Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.  Eric, Mommy got you a present! Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow. This year is gonna be different. Look!  It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.   Hon, are you ready for some math problems? Oh, all right.  Yes? Sure, hon.   Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs. Eric, please. We have to do some studying today. You're the best, Randy! We now return to the 42nd Annual Nobel Prize Awards. Here again your host, Whoopi Goldberg.  Look at this sword. Only on House Shopping Network. It has a dragon on the blade.  It's got a dragon painted right on the blade! You should buy the samurai sw- It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword- And now back to... Jakovasaurs! on Comedy Central.  And now, back to the movie of the week, ''Aliens''.

You can take Alabama Man to the bowling alley, where he drinks heavily and chews tobacco.  When his wife asks him where he's been, just use the action button,  and Alabama Man busts her lip open. Alabama Man comes with everything you see here. Wife sold separately. Not all people from Alabama are wife-beaters.  Welcome to ''Huntin' and Killin'' with Jimbo and Ned. Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South . Good morning, South Park, it's 8 a.m.,  This Saturday, Pox presents the musical event of the new millennium! You all remember playing the recorder in elementary school!  Live, from Oklahoma City!  playing "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" on their recorders... "MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE" special.   No! No, this can't be! Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words. I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is  It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die! I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen. Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov.  Yes! Yes, I think it worked!  You are going to be parents! I'm sorry, honey. What?! Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings! Why?!  Huh? Yes. Why? Kyle, where's your mother? Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom. We're rooting for the ''Broncos'' here, Jakov!  Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has ''better'' pretzels.  Sorry I'm late. Oh! Hi, Kyle.  As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue. All right, we did it! Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh... Uh, you know, the people ''really'' responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next. Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings. Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment? Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker? And you did nothing. Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school? Oh! So you ''admit'' that harassment goes on! You don't know?! You're the principal!  So it DOES go on!!! Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no? Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda. Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on? And who's to blame? There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth! Pan-Panda's mouth. All right! We did it, Eric! That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house? Yes, it ''is'' big, isn't it? It is very big. Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from ''that'' money that we got our 1.3 million. No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other. Sort of, yeah.  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools! So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me!  ''Wow'', I'm good!  Don't answer that!  Incriminate.  Well? What do you think, Kyle? Well, this one is ''bigger''!  Kyle, let me explain something to you. You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't ''do'' in the workplace. No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?  Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it. Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated. Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.  No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and too easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda! Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream! Wow, neat! Yeah. Well, screw you guys!  Yeah, I know what you mean. Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try? Yeah! ...Was that your leg? Yeah. She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home. I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome. Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be...  You haven't? Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy. NO, no, uh I don't think so. Sure is.   So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting. Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you? Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting. Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.  Can I come with you?  Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you. So, so now we can't be friends? We said we'd never tell anybody? Oh, uh I didn't realize that.  Well, uh uh a few people, yeah. You didn't say ''not'' to tell anyone. Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before. Hey, Randy, what's up? Huh? Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you. You're having regrets, aren't you? Hey. Talk to me. I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship. Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, ''you'' might not need to talk about it, but ''I'' sure do. Having a good time? I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-  Honey? Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me? I just want to know it meant something to you. So we're friends again? I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts! You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout. Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?  Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout. Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle. Yeah, lie. Hey, it's a bear!  Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back. We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys. I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play. Yeah, I guess so. Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something. You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand? Hm... Good point; here's $10.  Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too.  Oh God, is there nothing we can do? You bet money on my son to win?! Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff. Yeah. See ya.  The flagpole! That's great!  He can't do that! Uh, what are they doing? You're dreaming! This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me! More schnapps!  Where am I? Me neither. What's "grab ass?" Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back. Hello, everybody. Say, can I join in? <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I love you.</i></poem> <poem><i>You're so hot</i></poem> <poem><i>on that show.</i></poem> <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I love you.</i></poem> <poem><i>You're so hot</i></poem> <poem><i>on that show.</i></poem> <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I-</i></poem> huh?   ...Oh, sorry. <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I love you.</i></poem> <poem><i>You're so hot</i></poem> <poem><i>on that show.</i></poem> <poem><i>Courtney Cox,</i></poem> <poem><i>I love you.</i></poem> <poem><i>You're so hot</i></poem> <poem><i>on that show.</i></poem>  One question? It's already on full.  Oh, what now?!  Children, what the hell are you doin'? You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat. Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out. It's really gonna piss you off. This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.  Oh! Hello there, children! Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit. Well, it's true. Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and ''really'' hit it off. No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked. Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself. Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica. Children, Veronica is moving in with me. I'm in love. Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me. Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too. <poem><i> We have a chance to find the sunshine.</i></poem> Hello there, children. Eric, you got glasses! Huh? You bet!  Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old. Why not?? Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even ''you'' will have to face with each other some day. That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did. You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball? Oh! Uh, hello there, children. Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot. Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing. Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married.  My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too. Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back.  It's okay, pop. What?! All right guys! That's e''nough!'' I have ''had'' it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and ''you'' can't be happy for me! No buts, Stan!  Iii do!   What the-?! What the-?!   No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her. Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream. Hello there, children! How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots? Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: <poem><i><br />Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.<br />You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.<br />But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.<br />And then you're left with nothing, cause your thinking with your dong. So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!<br />Just play it cool and don't be a fool...</i></poem> <poem><i>Daaamn right, Garrison! </i></poem> And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up! Hello there, children! How's it going? Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes. Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut. I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he? Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge. Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out. Is everybody okay? What the...? Well, I must say I still don't get this at all. Father, why did you go to all this trouble? Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park? Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!  Oh, hello Stan. How's it going? Why bad? Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker? OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly. Your little girlfriend, Wendy. Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is? Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you.  ...Is that what I said? Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there. We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, "What's the meaning of life?" or "Why are we here?". Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones.  Caller, you're on the air. That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming. Do you have an opinion on global warming? Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.  How are y'all doing tonight? <poem><i>And heaven and nature sing...</i></poem> <poem><i>And heaven and na-</i></poem> He he hoo, get away!

Uuh-huh? So, what happens at the millennium? Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace. Well, what do ya want? Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute.   Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback! It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you. But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback. Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30. Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!  Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.  Hey, Rod, great to see you. Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever! What? Poo pants? Uh, you pooped your pants? Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?  What??  ...Hello? Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. ''Please'' make them like it. Well, I tell you one thing. ''I'' sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod "Do You Think I'm Sexy?" Stewart!  Oh no.  Please, Father. Do something.  Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight. Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again. Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you. Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life. If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party. I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.   It's Dad. Father. You came. Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End. We want answers! You've killed us all! Someone's got to pay! You killed us all! Shove that Nobel prize up your ass!  Now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust, o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet. Well I, for one, am not farting anymore!  We don't want your solutions, phony! Give me that!  Yeah! Damn you Marsh! Get out of town! You fraud!   Up your- Arrn! Still more up next from the heat wave caused by Randy Marsh. A giant glacier is melting above South Park and the entire town is doomed. And now, these messages. Having a hard time with male potency?  Are you a lawyer? We want to sue Randy Marsh. He gave us skin cancer. Il est si comme Jerry Lewis!!! (He's just like Jerry Lewis!!!)  Yeah! Yeah. He put the hole in the ozone, and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies. Look.  Look! There he is! Get him! You're a dead man, Marsh!  Could I borrow one of your rocks? Huh?   Hello, Eric. How's my little piggy today? I just say that because you're my little buddy. Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it now! Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing.  All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters? All right, read them out for me. No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence.   Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two? Just pick one. ''Or'' two.  Okay. One, or two? One, or two?  One, or two? One, or two? ''No!'' The answer is ''one'', piggy! One!   Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests. All right, we got the test results back, piggy- You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems. It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better. Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new.  I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses. That's why we have the little stapler.  Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right?  All right. Time to laser me a little piggy.  I bet his ''mom'' wishes she could do that. Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing? I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes. Was he an organ donor? All right, then let's get to work.  Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you? Hey Chef! What?! Wa-a-a-ah! Al-right! Aaaaaaaa!  Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!  Hello there, children. It's time for lunch-e-roo Chef quit. Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp.  When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp.  Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone.  Derp! Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp! Love?! Hey, Chef. Yes. Yeah! Yeah! Okay, let's get him...  Hooray!  Whoa!  Whooaaa!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  Aaaa! Aaaah! Alright!  Goodbye, Marvin. Oh, you knight.   Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you. What's the problem?  Hello, children! Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie. Huh? A what?  Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?  Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand? Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow,   Children! That hurts my feelings. I do! ''There's got to be a morning after. [the needle is removed and there's no more music]'' ''I'll'' take care of them!   Aaargh! Noooo!  <poem><i>Let's keep on looking for the light.</i></poem> Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you? Chef? Oh! The black guy! Third cubicle on the left  Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire? Wow! You really got fat. Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now.  You're not fooling anyone! This is insane, Mr. Garrison.  Mr. Garrison isn't here right now. Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?! No! No, you moron!  Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone! Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?! You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you! Hello there, children. I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding. Well, come on in.  Well, aren't you crackers just cute as the dickens? Well, he should be out now directly. Say, would you crackers like to hear about the time we saw the Loch Ness monster? Ooh, it must've been about seven, eight years ago. Me and the little lady was out on this boat, you see, all alone at night, when all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era, comes out of the water. Yes, all his life. Oh, he's so excited about the wedding now. We was so scared, Lord have mercy, I jumped up in the boat and I said "Thomas, what on earth is that creature?!" Oh, it was so scary! Tree-fitty. I gave him a dollar. I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar. It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,- and I yelled. I said, "What do you want from us, monster?!" And the monster bent down and said, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty."  Three dollars and fifty cents. That's right. I said "I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!" She gave him a dollar. Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more! And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July- August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout- And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things- Raisin oatmeal, and I said "We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty." Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. I said, "Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!" It said, "how about just ''two''-fitty?" I said, "Oh, now it's only ''two''-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!" Damn right, I was angry! Aah, shut your mouth, woman! Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the... Could I have your attention please?  Ooh there I go! I ''told'' myself I wasn't gonna cry, now. Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, "Poppa, poppa!" I said "What do you need, Chef, my boy?", and he said, "...I need about tree-fitty." Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, "Chef, why do ''you'' need tree-fitty?" He said, "My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it." I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster! I said, "''Dammit'' monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!" So I chased the monster down the street, you see...  ...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that. Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, "What do you want from me, alien?!" and do you know what he said? Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, "tree-fitty." And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?! What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?! Well no ''wonder'' the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty! She's a goddam Succubus!  Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty! Oh. I'll "Oh" whoever I want!  August. And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all. Raisin oatmeal. ...Tree-fitty. The Loch Ness monster. Lord, he was angry. Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass. Thomas, you're gonna get me going now.  ...Tree-fitty. Oh, it was scary! We had taco salad that night. Tree-fitty. I had just given him tree-fitty the week before.  He tricked me. Aaah, my baby's getting married! Succubus trying to take my baby!   You damn monster! Get away from my baby!  Oh my- Oh my God!  Oohma poota! Meesa scared! Ooba jaaga! Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop! Meesa needa Jakov.  Dwooo''oooo!'' Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned! Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.  What the hell's goin' on?! Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?  Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it! Well, let's kill it. Huh? Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it. Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight.  Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting! Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  Well, try it out! Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake. What? What is it? We just encourage them to find someplace better. Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed! Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express. Close the door!  The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical. Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks! Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing. You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off. Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you. Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing.  Keep your guard up, Tweek!  All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here.  Punch him in the balls, Tweek!!  Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down!  Good! Now ''kick'' his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood. Now THAT'S BOXING! "Don't Sue People" Panda?  Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year. ...What?? Where is he?! Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here.   Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a ''little'' gay. Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house. Huwell, uh he's got a point there. Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks. Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, ''always'' bet on the Jew. What?!  Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee! You can do it, kid! You can do it! You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh! Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds? You what?? See ya, Cotswolds.  Thanks for stopping by.  Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole! Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape. Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole! Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole! Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever! I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores. And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924. Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed.  ...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!  Fire!  Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion ''over the bell''. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time. Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose. What??  By God, he's right! Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it! And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!  Surrender your men, general! [yells] '''SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!''' The South wins!  Aw, come on. Have a little sip.  Huh? They don't?!  You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around! I'll bet we could, too!   Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can! Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!  All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride! Let's go! Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee! It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!  Blouach. Hey! There's some more schnapps over here! Medic!   Where to next, General? Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated. Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything? Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps? I guess we drank it all.  Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.  Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick. We're goin' home kid. Come on.  Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here. Well, uh I guhess ''one'' little cheers is in order. Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again!  You heard the General. Charge! We got it! The fort is ours!  What do we do, General? We're outnumbered. Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up!  Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?!   Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei. Hey! Who's that?! Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer! All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.  Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over. We thought you did. We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the ''least'' God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999! Here he comes!  Whoa, man.  Shut... up... Jimbo.   Yes... Hello..., um..., I... lost... my... voice... box… I... lost... my... voice... box…   Mmm. Aw, Jimbo, I can't thank you enough for the new voice box. Gmmm, now, what in the devil is ''this'' thing? Mmm-aw, what a bloody pickle ''this'' is! Did you keep the receipt, then? Gmmm, blimey.  Oh... boy..., oh... boy.  I know. I'm still trying to find my old one. Mmrr I can still kick ass. Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch?   Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch? AAAAaaaarrgh. Ow. Mmm-me too.   Ow. Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head. Mayor, we're from the Department of Interior. Ooh, yes. How are you? Right over here.  What? Oh, neato. Hope. Why, that's a ''perfectly'' beautiful name! No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it! Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!  Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy. And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!  We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone. She's a cannon!  Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out! All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do ''some''thing, but we can't just make them leave. But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in? Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there. But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right?  ''Now'' what do we do? You have? You can't leave.  Hello! Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?! We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some ''normalcy'' back to this town! Ready?  Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do ''is lose!''  And, all one of you lucky contestants has to do is answer only ''one'' of these questions! Are you ready, players? Okay. Hands on your buzzers.  You have to wait until I ask the question first. That's okay. Hands on buzzers. Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?!  Now, ''can'' we get on with this? First question: What color is blue?  What? What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to ''lose'', you idiot! Just don't answer any more questions, got it? Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three! What's two plus two, Jakov? Jakov, what is your name?  Oh, screw it. Jakov wins!  You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France! All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!   I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution. Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream! People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying... Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen?  O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution. Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible. All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary. And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds!   All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious." Closely attentive to details. Careful. Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious. Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Eric, your word is "chair." Something you sit on. English!  Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!! All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school.  Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral. Having to do with a lake or ocean. Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.  Correct! Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic. Krocsyldiphithic. Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality. Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell. Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.  Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip. Look out, he's got a gun!  Oh.  Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia. Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take ''all'' your people in.  Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.  Fine, just fine. Mm-it's amazing. Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen. Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction. Now we must find a safe place for it. Well, that sounds fine, just fine. Thank you, Mayor.  The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back. ...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival. Well, Jakov, we hope this new home "inspires" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know...  Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your...  I guess we don't ''know'' exactly how jakovasaurs mate. Amazing! The gestation period was only four days. Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine. Wow! That would be a ''great'' start for them.  Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters. Huh?!  Whoa-o-whoa! Don't worry, We've come up with a plan. Yes. We're leaving. We're getting the hell out of here and away from those God-damned things.  Fine, just fine. My God, McClanahan, do you believe it?  Incredible.  We know of this creature only from remains frozen in snow. This one jakovasaur can mother an entire population of the animals. Fine. Well, we'd love to see ''more'' jakovasaurs, so, maybe you two should uuh…  There ''is''... another option. We did it! At that rate, we could repopulate the jakovasaurs in just a few years. Fine. Here we go. Looks like there might be a second one. Little boy, we're making ''you'' an honorary Department of Interior person.  So now, ''you'' are officially in charge of South Park's fish and wildlife. ''You'' have authority over all of them. That's right. And people must respect it. Fine, just fine. Bye-bye, now.   Fine. Fine, just fine. Get to some business.  Yeah! Just fine. This is the first step in bringing the species back from the brink of extinction!  Hope. Hai.  Meesa name Junjun. Uuh?! Aw, we's in big doodoo now. Meesa just don't wanna! Oh-wwooo''ooop!'' Oh-wwooo''ooop!'' Doe-wo''oop!'' Doe-woo''oop!'' Do''woop! [her water breaks and lands on everyone]'' Do''woop! [a baby jakovasaur is shot out and strikes the wall. It whimpers as it drops]'' Do''woooop!'' Do''woop!'' Huh-owhoa-o-''woop! [pumps out a second set of jakovasaurs]'' G'ooh-woo-''ooop!'' Booo-wooop? Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated.  Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible! Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-''oh. [falls on his face and gets up]'' Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick. What means a jakovasaur? Oh. Cool beans. That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different. Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.  Huhello, guys. I love new friends.   Junjun!   Yyeow!  I am? Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond.  Uh oh. Thank you! Wow!! It's so pretty! What? What?  What?? Ooohh. Well, all right, then.   I don't know what to do! I have seamen? Where's their boat?   Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!  Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park! Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys! Go Niners! Ni-ners! Oo''oops!'' You guys know what?  This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit- You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me. Sure. You got money?  Memphis? I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do ''you'' think, honey? Yeah. Okay, we'll move to Memphis! Great, Eric! We're moving. Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis. It would? O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!  Boy, it was rough at work today. I've never seen so much coffee. No, in the boss's lap.  Hello, son. How was your day? What? You mean MTV played a video that wasn't Will Smith?  That's called a mailman. He takes care of mail. You're a nut! Let me see that letter.  Eric! The Mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in South Park! Big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation- Woo, woo!  Mayor? This is Jakov. I'm the tall fellow down the block from- Sure! If a free trip is involved, can my whole family go? Cool beans!!  Ready.  Sor-ry!  Turkey sandwich!   No, it's my fault. I'm sorry. Sorry. Awww, did I lose? I don't know! I do?  Hooray!  But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first? Oh yeah. Well, good-bye everybody! We'll send stuff from France!    Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you? Excuse me?  Excuse me? ...and Bubby Brister is having a ''great'' first quarter! Let's see what trickery he uses here.

O-wowo-oop! O-woo-oop! Ooo! Fight! Fight!  <poem><i>School, school! I like school! </i></poem> And they're creating more trash than we can handle, too! Hooray!  Hello, dad. Oh, not so good. Something really strange happened. Noho, dad. A man in a blue suit and a bag came to the door. He just left this li'l piece of paper with a stamp on it.  Oh! He took care of mom, too.  Wuh-I love Chinpokomon. Give it here!  Aaagg-agh--!  He's neat, Mommy.   Right. Ready. Damn, he's quick! No, I'm sorry.   No, it's all me. Uh, my bad. Sorry.  Blue?  Uh. Blue is blue? Where am I? Okie-dokie. Four?  Jakov   Okay, so just what is going on here, people? What? Are you sure? So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide? What's the Ganz technique? Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen?  That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.  What the hell is ''that'' thing??  Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me! Oh? Okay buddy, you can explain downtown!   The South win?  Got it! Bonjour. Café? (I love its antics!!!) This is shop class. My name is Mr. Adler. For the next week, rather than your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning how to make things. Now, does anybody know WHY you're in shop class?  Yes? Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  shop class. Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...  Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class? That true, Craig? You a troublemaker? Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?! Yes, you did!  Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much! Aaaarr! Uh.   Huh? Stop screwing around! Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed. Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later. Why? Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on. I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts.  Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time.   Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing!   Huh? Uh, what? The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago. What? Hey! Go on!   No. No. Make it stop. Baaaaa!  Good-bye, cruel world.  What? Who are you?  Hrh.   Hey! What's going on? Well, why the hell don't you stop them? Don't screw aROUND!<br /> Stop screwin' aROUND!!<br /> Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!!   You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class? What? What's that, son? AAaaagh!  But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye. Good-bye? No. You... you're right. You're right.  Gram'ma? Hi, Gram! Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again! Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive.  Thank you, baby. Thank you. Arrh! No, I'm not! Arrrrh!   Gaarhrhrh!  He does? Why?  Rrrrh! He doesn't ''look'' like he wants to fight me.  Rrrr! What a jerk! Why?! What did I do?! I guess so.  Arrh! What do you guys want? Craig and I have no reason to fight each other. He did? I don't have crooked teeth! Everyone in the world?! Rrrr!  I'm not a chicken!  Wait! I'll fight! Okay. Errh! Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??  Well? Nrr. What happened? Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  How? Me neither. Like what, then? Rrrrh! Hwaaah!  Uugh! Ow! Rrrr! Hrrr. Rrrr, mean, rrrr. Rrrr!  What? Rrrr!   Rrr! Uuh! You son of a bitch!   Guh!  I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.  What's happening? Oh cool! Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it! Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now! Yeah!  Dare ga pu shita no.   Richard!  Richard. Ri-chard!  Richard!  Richard!  Richard.  Richard, you ''have'' to move on. I ''want'' you to be happy. Then say it now, Richard. There. Now do you feel better? Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it.  I love you, Richard. See you soon. Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow. What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree? I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life. Come on! It's time for the fight! Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer.  Bye, Kenny. Hey, what's going on? Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago. I guess they don't wanna fight. Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last? Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight. Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler! Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander   What's that? What? She die or something? Oh boy! Here we go!  All that build-up for nothing.  Programs, get your programs here. Programs. Hababah... Wow! I wanna sue somebody!   Um...  We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us. Yeah, they left. What the-? Damn, baby.  How was school today, son? That's great. Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met.  You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive. Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight.  It's true. I was.  Well what, honey? Yes, I ''think'' that's right. Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something. With who? Don't just "Oh" him, Thomas! Richard, aren't you going to invite me in? Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-''tempt'' to make love to me tonight. Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why? We'll use plastic wrap.  Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats.  Okay, that was ''very'' good, class. Now let's try this one together.  Honey, can I get a new wardrobe? All right, now let's try ''this'' one together.  Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car.... Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one.  I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life. Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try?  I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed.  O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick? Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you. Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good. No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class. Now, now. Very few students are ''severely'' injured in a shop class. Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you ''any''thing? Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect.  In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf. The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready? Let us begin.  Ready? And, th-ree. Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf! Fight back! Resist the ass! It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind. There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession.  Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?  Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....  Hi, Sexual Harassment Panda. Awgh..! Yeah!  '''''AAGGGHHH!!'''''  '''''AAGGGGHHH!!''''' Juuhachi da nee!  Soo desu nee!   Awww.  Awww. You never said good-bye to me either.   Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up.  Again?!  What?!   Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law. "...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..." Uh-oh. That's right, he can. "The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda." Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that ''is'' sexual harassment. I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible. Panda. Who? Oh, all right.   I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. It's because I'm a panda, isn't it? I can't help what I am. Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense. I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?! It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots!  Why? Seems all I do now is cause trouble. But, I'm just a panda. What message? ...You know? You little cubs might just be right.  Okay! Hello, everyone. I'm Peetie, the "Don't Sue People" Panda. Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you.  "Don't Sue People" Panda. Pandas love ice cream.  Hello, cubs. I'm "Don't Sue People" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now.  This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman? All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school. Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say? I need to hear your defense. All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty. Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately. Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom? You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat.  Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court! After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages. Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school. You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million. Next! Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million. Next! Half his stuff, 2 million from the school. This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone.  Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski. Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed!   Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football. Well, not any more than any other student. I don't know! I can't be around every second! All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!   Oh, dear God! We're ruined! Oh..!   Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.  All right, what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget? Oh, right. We certainly can't afford ''him'' anymore. Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris. Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda. Uh—M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a "panda" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children.  ...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go. That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours. Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs. Holy smokes, you're right! Ugh!  P-please! Don't sue us. Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go.  D'uh. I mean, he left. I won! Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here. We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play? I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?  Hey, look at this!  It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.  Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan? Well.  Alrighty then. Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week? Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission. Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us? Oh, that's a splendid mission! Bosley! Bosley! Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels. Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs. So Bosley, what's our next mission? We did it! Great job, Angels! What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley? Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission? Oh dear. We've angered Bosley. Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits. Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission. But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again. Now what do we do?   I think that's got it. Did I do a nice job? Really? O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day!  There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job. But, if I say that, you'll hit me. Please, hit me. Ooowww! Oh, my goodness!   Let's trade sandwiches. Well. Uh, your credentials are very impressive, and you do seem to have a lot of ambition, uh but I'm afraid there's no room for you at our company at this time. Well, i-it is because you're a panda. Euh, it's because you're a sexual harassment panda. Now, have you ever heard of a retreat called "The Island of Misfit Mascots"? Well, uh, yes. They may be... just what you're looking for. As sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state, the mother of all trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, the lawyer from South Park who plans to make quite a commission. Representing the side of Everyone Else is Gerald Broflovski. So whatever the outcome, things look very bright for Kyle's dad. Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just a whore, taking advantage of everyone in town and...  This just in! Newscaster Kevin McCarty is being sued by Kyle's dad for slander. The newscaster has yet to be reached for comment. Wait... Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house.  According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued. The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks.  The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside. We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house  showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards! I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest? So what are your plans, commander? Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander. For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out.  Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics? Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves. Yes. Huh? , proving that the people inside are not cultists after all. ''And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States.'' ...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news, , who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills. Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" on their recorders.  It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has... Words to live by.  Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick? Another scotch?  Now, calm down, Skeeter. He ain't hurtin' nobody. Sk-heeter, I don't want no trouble nu-how. Damnit, Skeeter! How come every time a panda bear come in here you gotta go flappin' your jaw? Yeah? What can I do for you? Big panda bear, big panda bear, hm... Now, calm down, Skeeter. They ain't hurtin' nobody. Now, Skeeter, I don't want no trouble. Kids, there was a panda bear in here. He said somethin' about the Island of Misfit Mascots. If I'm not mistaken, it's over near the Jenkins' place. Nu-how, Skeeter. She ain't hurtin' nobody. Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody.  God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up. <poem><i>So I'll drive this ol' 18-wheeler down the highway...</i></poem> Hey! Panda bear!  We don't take kindly to your types in here. No!  Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here. No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!  We don't take kindly to panda bears! Whoa! Lookie her!  We don't take kindly to your types around here!  Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!  Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here! Let's get him!  Let's get him.  We don't take kindly to your types around here!  Hello there, boys. I'm Willy, the "Don't Stare Directly Into The Sun" Worm. Now, you boys know not to stare directly into the sun, right? That can burn your retinas and make you blind.  That's why he's on the Island Of Misfit Mascots.  Hm...  Heeyy, I'm a real worm, pal!! Yeah!  Oink oink! Be sure to run around with scissors, says Oinky, the "Run Around With Scissors" Pig.  Hey, kids! I'm Jimmy, the "Don't Hold On To A Large Magnet While Someone Else Uses A Fan Nearby" Falcon! Here, watch.  See? Hello, kidsh, I'm Hoppy, the "Don't Do Stuff That Might Irritate Your Inner Ear" Badger.  Well, I'll leave now. I'm a sad panda, too. I'm a ''really'' sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault!  Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.   Yeah. Hooray!  Heheheheh! Now I will kill the President and Salma Hayek! You cannot stop me, James West!  Oh, save me! Who will save me? Yes, but I need to get out of here and eat some tacos and burritos. Me gusta tacos mucho! Help me! Help me! This is Salma Hayek. Is anybody there?  Over here! Please, come quick!  Over here! Please help me! I am lost and I have no clothes! I'm over here! Please help me! I will reward you greatly! Oh, please help me! ''Please'' help me! I will give you tacos!  If we save her, I am going to take off her pants and play Slip'N'Slide! Okay. I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time. Bears? Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when ''I'm'' babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?! My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!   Figure it out, turd! ...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w- ...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night- Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie.  I placed his underwear over his head. Well, ''I'm'' watching ''Friends'', turd!   Hey, Skyler. He's my boyfriend!  He's 22!  You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz! Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments  No, Skyler. Quit it. Eight days tomorrow. I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all. Well, maybe just one kiss. Go on, Astroturd! Turd Rock From the Sun! We left you some crusts!  Guess again, Richard the Turd! You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.  Skyler, not here.  Really? Wow! O Skyler, I love you.  What the-?  Give me that picture! Open this door, Turdledove! Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you.   Give me that picture, turd!  Who is that?! Skyler, your band can't practice here. Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy.   Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident! We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back. Not really. She's dead.  Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead! HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!  Honestly? I think you guys need some work. I just think your sound is kind of... last week. Well, I ''do'' have a song I wrote. Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed! ''In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!'' We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd! Wha-? What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?! What?! No you don't! ...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us. But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on! Shut up, turd! What are you doing? Go away, turd! No. NO!  No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you! 'Cause I'm twelve!  No! What?? But I thought you liked me.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so ''stupid.'' Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly. You don't think so? You're right! He ''is'' a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how. Huh? Really? You would do that? This won't take me long! I'm almost done.  They're having a cat orgy! Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted! Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends. No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here. Wow, she passed out. Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay. Meowrowr!  Meow rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!  Rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!  Meow. Meow. Meowrowrowrowrowrowrowrowr.

And I still don't get any action. But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old. Mmmmm  Beat it, chubby! Mmmmm  Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room.   I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them.  I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar.

Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!

We will have to do it again sometime. No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life. Because I'm home-schooled. My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school. Right.  Oh my goodness, are you two enemies? Strange, friends would call each other names and fight. Papa? Why can't I go to school with the other boys? But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá. I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like. Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days. Hooray! Hey, guys. What's up? The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.  Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't. You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose? Oh, dear. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.  Well, they duct-taped me to a bench. I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all. But I want to go back tomorrow, papá. Please, just give me one more day.   Can I sit here with you? Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend? I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.  Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me. Huh? Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow? Alright.  She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.  You're out of control. ''[turns to Kyle] You'' did this to my sister! You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you!   ...I'm not through with you, bitch!   I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things.  Thanks, gaywad.  See ya, papá!  Oh, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch! Yeah, dude. What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? She's like, 12. Rowr! Geuugh.  Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however. Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think. Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  They got those thick noses and all. Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be.  Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels. No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it. Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid? Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley.  Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it. Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels!  Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown. Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for? So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder? Well, hooray! Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was. Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission? Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we? Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such? Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Whoa!  Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families. How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways? Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus- Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on. Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again? Tha-at sounds awful dangerous. Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir? Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir.  Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then! Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya. Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh? Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench. Got it.  Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All! Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape. Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess. Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister?  Woo-oh Holy Cow!  Yeah. He's a badass!  Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.  Well, she sure is. Uh, conuh-  Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch. Oh. O-oh, okay. I like math. What are you? A sourpuss?  Neato. How should I know? Which Angel am I again?  Air shaft. I wanna be a reporter someday. Do you think someday I can be a reporter? See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter. This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  Anything else? Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news. Hey, I'm a real reporter. Wow, you mean that? Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.   Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there. Get down!  It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts.  Of course we're sure!  We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our ''job'' to know what these fanatics do! Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them. What's the situation? Any luck talking to somebody in the house? Alright. Johnson! I'm sending you in. Watch your ass. Damn it, where is Johnson?! Those bastards!  Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan! Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot-  Did you see them move?! Lay down your weapons! Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them.  I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique. This is what we did in Waco.  Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will.   Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts. We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir. No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him. Sir, this isn't gonna look good.  Sir! Yes, sir!  Heeey, I love mai tais!  ...I did. Yes. I'm Connelly, and this is Sphinx. We're with the CIA.  Yah. Yeah, they moved alright. Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now? Well... Let's go kick his ass! Aw!  Yeah! Dude! Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay. Huh? Ricky Martin, the singer. Oh, is he? We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now. Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out. It is, but we can't let them kill themselves. Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs.  We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.  Look. You see this? You see this? You see it? You see it? Go get it.  Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass! Look out!  Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command!  Alright everyone, fire!  Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation.  Woops. You're right. Quick, let's get out of here!  Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay?  Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it.  Good night, everyone. Aw, I was just in the hot tub.  Uh huh.  Yeah! Myeup, me too. Hey! Yup. I don't know. Alright, enough of this! Bring out God! Simulation? Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys. Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams.  Eng jeck.  Buwor?  Buh buh buh buh.  No-o.  Buh buh buh buh. Boul ball. No. Uh-uh.  Cokeshen. Mommy. No. Neah Kyle doh. Hey, Chih-paw-ko. Uh ar, stufid. Whoa won toooo-reeee. No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog. Cokeh mocker. Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay? Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us. Name? What?  Alright, get to Meshuggeneh Hall! The meeting is already starting.  I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts. Come on!  Okay, Squirts, the elders have given us a very important task tonight. We are all going to make macaroni pictures, like this one,  using dry macaroni, paper, and glue.  Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole! Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael? Good. Matthew? Joseph? Okay. Ike?  Where did it go?! Squirts, go grab your gear! We're gonna hunt us a bear! Then I'll get my chutzpah badge for sure! ''We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurts<br />When we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts<br />[gasps. The brown bear is in front of him approaching a pile of crap]'' There he is, Squirts.  Oh, no!  Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now! Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison.  Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt!  You think you can stop me from getting my chutzpah badge, you stupid bear?! Think again! ''We are Jew Squirts, we know Jewish<br />Stick stick smiley smiley Stick stick smiley smiley<br />dur dur dur dur dur--''<br />Hold it, Squirts! This is where we'll set our trap. Everyone remember your squadron. Alpha-5 and Gamma-7 will be on recon teams. Alpha will take left flank and flush the bear out of sector three. Once we're in position, I want constant contact between all squad leaders. We'll flush him out and we'll attack him!   Where's Zigmal? God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?! That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well, I'm not ''gonna'' let a stupid bear get the--  Damn! Damn, damn, damn! Okay, bear, that does it! You wanna kill all the Squirts?! You can have 'em! I give up! I don't need my chutzpah badge, or Jew Scouts, or any of this crap! Forget it! Elder Schwartz, I lost the Squirts! I lost all the Squirts!  ''Baleilah hazein, Hame kadesh mekoh hikenazu puanazikeh hakeilah.'' (Now gather us, the elders, on this most holy of nights.) I want to welcome you all. Though we each come from a different sect of Judaism, on this night of Jewbilee, we all pray to Moses as one. ''Hineinih kureh leirukeshu.'' (May all the power of Moses show the way...) Now, let us all introduce ourselves.  I don't believe I've heard of the anti-Semitic sect of Judaism before. ''Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit.'' (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.) All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses. Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here! We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here! Hello. Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance.  Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage. Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming. Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased.  Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second.  We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now! Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children? Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people? You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away!   An impurity, Moses? Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?!  A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with! You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake. Go now. You do not belong here.  Elder, what are you doing?! Elder, what have you done? If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed. If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear. No!  ''Helalelah, het Moshe.'' (Praise Moses.)  Elder Carn, from the Orthodox synagogue.  Elder Harris, from the Hasidic sect. How? Elder Garth, from the synagogue of anti-Semites. We're new.  Oh, enough already. What has Moses ever done for us? Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it-- All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews. If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?! Fine!   Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth. "And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith." Conch shell, like this one, hnee.  ''[prostrated, with conch in hand] Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud!'' ''[now standing with hands outstretched] Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht!'' Enter the conch shell, Moses!  And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity! I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I ''am'' running Jewbilee now!  Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand! Move!  Now! Now, Haman, your time has come! And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people!  Yes! Yess!! Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again! We await your return, Haman!  Your passage is safe from the enemies! Don't move! It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh! Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith! Enough of this waste of time!  Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! ''Einich! Hos!'' ''Zayak. Kareem! [Kenny comes up behind him]'' Hey, give that back!  Give me that book!  Haman will deal with you!  ''Ramek shtud! [lightning strikes the ground. Nearby, the bear returns and gets the conch shell. She moves away, only to take it to Kenny, who receives it. The bear growls and leaves. Meteors continue to shower down as a black cloud with a pair of red eyes appears among the gathering clouds]'' Yes! Yes!   Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you! Nooo! Eheh. Nooo!  Moses. Uh I, I apologize for any inconvenience, eheh. Uh yuh you see, I was just uh-- No! Aaagghhh! Ooww..!  How come we have to make macaroni pictures? What's ''your'' name? How come your head is lookin' so... funny-looking? Yeah, so his mommy brought us all over to play with him. And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife  Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man? O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um...  Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout. My honor, wide and true. I am proud to be a Jew Scout. Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew. ''[brings forth a large bell] Nahit chaim.'' ''Nahit chaim.'' ''Nahit chaim.''  Release Moses, now! Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die.  Yeah, obeying should work out swell.  Junichi. I pledge to be a Jew Scout. My honor, wide and true. I am proud to be a Jew Scout. Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew. ''Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head and strikes it once to produce a long, loud peal, then raises it. The boy walks off]'' ''Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head, strikes it, and raises it. The boy stumbles away crying]'' Apple. Cat. Oh, funt.  No! Triangle. We pray to Moses here, elder. He's reading from the Book of Haman! Uh I'm fine with obeying. They'll never reach. Oh, no. It's too late! That blow to his head must have killed him. We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny. Yes. Paper-plate bean shakers. May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively. ''The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah!'' ''I desire... [the elders and the Scouts await anxiously] I desire... macaroni pictures.'' ''I desire... popcorn necklaces.'' ''Hold! [Kenny stops in his tracks as Kyle looks on. Kenny looks at Moses] There is... an impurity.'' ''This child here is not kosher.'' ''No cake for the impurity.''   ''Die! [lightning comes out of both his eyes and nukes Garth until Garth explodes]'' ''[joins them next to Kenny] Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.'' ''And those little shaker things where... you put beans inside of paper plates that are glued together.'' ''And let us put patterns of glue on the outside of those paper plates so we can then pour glitter on them so they can look nice and sparkly.'' Agghhh!  Agghhh! Agh! Agghh!  Hey, welcome to the party.  See this li'l bear cub? It's his birthday. They are? Uh oh. Come on, Squirts. We have to help them. Squirts, fall in. Chinese formation.   Oh no, he's on to me, Haman. When do we get to eat carrot cake? I wanna go home. Elder, you cannot mean-- It's hopeless. Mrar.  Shlomo, get us out of here! Get the keys and unlock the door!   Get the keys and unlock the door! Look out! It is lost. It's the Squirts. Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there. It is Haman. You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to work!  What are you guys doing in there? What?!  Huh?   Oh, Jiminy gravy, what is this?? You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say?  '''''Ooowww!!''''' ''Free! Free to punish those that imprisoned me!'' ''Moses! Nooo!'' He saved us. He saved all the Jews.  Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids. Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks? Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh? Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime  here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow. It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes!  Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled. You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you.  Awwww!  Welcome to Spooky Laboratory.  Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action. Yes.  Uh...  Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.  And here you can feel the brains.  BOO! Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens! Oh no? Well, you should be!  The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha! Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts. Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands  cut up!  Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!   Rar! Darrrr! Aarrrrgh. Aarrrrgh! Are you sure we're goin' the right way? Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T! You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R. That's it!  Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P.  Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second. Yeah. I'm Jonathan  Hey, where'd Nibblet go? Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is? Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow. Groovy! Could you show us where to set up? Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts. Cancelled? Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up. Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum. Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts. Huh? But that makes them pirate ghosts. ''Pirate ghosts.'' Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery. So this is where you last saw your dead grandma. Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues. I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way,  Say, this looks like a clue.  The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody!   Fieldy, what are you doing?! Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us.  Mr. Banderas!  Jonathan! Alright! Great job, gang!   Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts. No! Arrest him! I think ''I've'' got this groovy mystery solved! It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks. And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels.  Well, sure. Why the heck not? Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive. The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:<br />And a-one, and-a-two, and a  I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.  Oops. A road? Hey, Kenny. They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates. "Pirate ghost" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate. No. It makes them ghost pirates. Hey, I got an idea.  We should set a groovy trap. We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll. Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas.  When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.  Jonathan, no! Hold on, guys!  David! You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them! Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts.  That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead!  The letter P? We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts. Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll?  Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do. What does this dead grandma look like? Oh, no! Head! We know. It's just cool to do. When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving. What the heck starts with the letter P? What? Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry. You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.  Oh, no! I lost my glasses. My glasses gotta be around here somewhere.  Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses. Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan? Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one!   Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a... Fieldy!  Aaaaraargh! I know! A t-ree! Hey! Like, it's just some kids. Oh, hey! The kids from last night. No, David. Then they ''are'' pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates. Pirate ghosts! Good idea. Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio. Hey! Somebody's coming.  Munky! Darrrr! Hi, Kyle. Chinpoko!  Down with America!  Who-o-oa.  ''Uh-huh'', Nibblet likes potato chips.  Okay.   Uh oh! Nibblet! O-kay!  O-kay!  Form of... CORN!   Nibblet! Mrs. Broflovski? We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you? Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave. Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body. Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak. Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well. Yes. And, now for the difficult part. It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like — an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably- ...Do? Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like.  Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might ''sound'' like.  Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town!  Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody? They say you can either fight them or join them. Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up. Yeahp. Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable. No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would ''have'' to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it. Brace yourself. Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen. Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!  I am. I know that. How about if someone made you have sex with your mother ''and'' father to save your ''own'' life? The father doesn't have a gun? Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman? Sign heah, and heah, and heah.  Noo! Don't go to the docks!  Arrrgh!  We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks!  Yeah! Raaarrrgh! Raarraarrgh!  Raaarrrgh! Aaaaah!  Aaaah!  Huh?? Eeewww!  Oooh! All right!  Raarrrr! Aaaah!  Someday, I will collect all the Chinpokomon, then I will fight the Evil Power that will reveal itself once all the Chinpokomon are collectable,  oh?  I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master. I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh? I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor. Go!  I must buy them all!

Wuh-okay, here's the next one.    <poem><i>Sometimes he's firm.</i></poem> Wow! I thought I told you to shut up!  I wanna be just like Alabama Man.  My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you. Yeah. Me too! Me too.  Welcome to "Hooked On Monkey Fonics," level 1.

"Litoral." Will you please use it in a sentence? "Littoral."  L I T O R A L Guh what's in a name?   Oh, heavens, no.  Hel-lo. Oh, hel-lo. He-ey, would you like to come up to my room? Woowould you like to come up to my room? I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses.  Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go.  I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there. Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride.   Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I ''not'' see it? Wha-y noh-ot?  I...  have looked at it. How can children go to school on a f-licker of light? Well, what else would one do? And woowhat is love? Woowhat means "ki-iss"? Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me. You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss.  How do we do it? Should we...  l-look it up? Wow. Wow, that was fun!  Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.    Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out? I'm... having... fun, Mark.   Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel.  Yes, Mark?  Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous! Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it. Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is! You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca? Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe!   Who was that?  Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea. Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close!  Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now.  Oh my God, son! Mark, what have they done to you?! Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools! Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers.  Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments.  Cotswolds. Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better.  And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop. Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love? I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine! No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers. I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school. Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise. Mark, where's your sister? Oh, alright. Rebecca, don't play that perverted game!  Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling!   They've got to be here somewhere. Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place! Mark. You're absolutely right.  Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school. What?!   Oooh. Mark, you ''have'' play time. You get to play in the afternoon. Yes she is.  Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca!  This little boy wants to see you. A little boy wanted to see Rebecca. But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children. I'm sure he's alright. Waaaaah!  But why? What?? What do we do? Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo! What?!  Hooray.  Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?!  I said, are you ready to rock?! Well, I'm glad we all learned something today, kids. Now, let's dance!  Marklar, this is Marklar. Approaching Marklar. Marklar.  Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar. Who? Marklar? Brought m- marklar?? Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar. Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!  Yes? You see? Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true. The marklars can stay! You marklars must leave. Yes, that's nice. Thank you for stopping by.

Don't you understand that unless you find Christ, you and all your people are doomed to eternal hellfire?  Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you. No, it's not food. It's a cross.  Who are you? Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ? Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them.  This is the Missionary 600. We have you locked on "fire: ready." Turn back right now.  The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough. I have the infidels in my sight.  Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes. Now we've got 'em!  Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens. They've opened the wormhole! Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins. What is "marklar"? What the hell did he say? But you will all burn forever in eternal hellfire.  Ooooohhh.   Whoa!  Whoa! Wooo! Necah * * necundat?  Nn * * de co?

That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?! We already know you know him. We have this!  But they're just kids. We can't torture them. Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship? Adopted from whom? Where can we find her?! Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know.  Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin. Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here.   There it is!  Call those boys' mothers.  I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to. Tom Brokaw? Oh no, the press already?  Uh huh.  Mr. Brokaw, I presume.  Nooo! We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology. Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food. Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite.  Doesn't that get confusing? Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now! Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space. Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know ''this'' person?  Who? This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures. Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!  Who is this person! Do it again.  Sally Struthers! I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go. I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive. Ah, Ms. Struthers. Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia. We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him.  Why, yes. It ''is'' a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers  Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy...  I'm... glad we can do business. Here they are! We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents! Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him?  Back away from the space craft, children! You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government! I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests. Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.  Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters. Son of a bitch! Get 'em!  Damnit, damnit, damnit! Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel. Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral.  Good! Now get them in our tractor beam!  Oh ho ho ho.  Oh? Makarendae bi cho.  Ho ho ho. Do ba kim.  Mmmmo na ka!  Onadonakami? Chewmbacca vije dai gwo.  Juodo nakahobi? Ho ho ho ho.  Wo? Wo chaka gom??

He needs you to send us money so we can help others.  Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it. Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ. Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser.  Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen. Everyone, the Word of God is going around the world and all your help is so greatly appreciated. Eh-oo What we need now is an argon crystal laser.  Eh you see, an argon crystal laser can pierce thick space holes in a way that other lasers just can't. Send your money now. Uuh-I th-thank you. Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin.  Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker  I don't have a fucking idea up here. Greetings. Welcome to Marklar. I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar.  Marklar to you. We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us. Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar. Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you. Amazing. What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?  E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you.  You presume wisely, sir. I'm here to get the big story, the big scoop.  Seeing as though I am Pulitzer-prize-winning Tom Brokaw... What?! Do you question my integritah?! Buh-eh, ugh. I had some bad burritos today. Aawwww! Aaah. Aaah.  Aaaah!   Warning. Deflector shields failing.  Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too. I'm tired of losing this battle! That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka! Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell!  Me, too. Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run?  What happened? What killed him, doctor? Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas? Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.  What the hell? The Confederacy doesn't take the bell! God dammit! Now we have to start over! Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to-  God dammit, what the hell are they doing?! God dammit! Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed. They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado. You bastards! Nice thinkin', Billy. Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it! Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson!  Yeah! Yeah!   Huh? Wha-? Yeah! Yeah, woohoo! Yeah! Yeah!  Come on! Yeah. Yaaaaah! Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day! Yeah. If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, "Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you," ...I would have sex with myself. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Ken Burns effect]] sequence starts using a 19th century sepia image of Cartman as General Lee]'' Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee. Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.  I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists. Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins! Fire a warning flare! Woops. Then how do we stop them? Let's go.   Attention political activists: you are on government historical monument property! Surrender the monument with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up. Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar. Sir! Yes sir!  Now what?  We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children. Uugh. Ouch. Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl.  We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need. Yes, please. Do a shot out of my breasts.  I got you. ''Oo''-oh.  Yeah!  Woohoo! And the Confederates won the fort? Hold it right there!   We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy! Oh boy, this doesn't look good. As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them? I'm so glad I don't have your job.  It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people. What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them. Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists!   Sir! Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands. My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol. All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War. Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it? That's it? I-I don't have to sign this thing?   Boys, as President of the United States, I want to commend you for stopping the rebel uprising. Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War.  Hooray! Wow! Fighting the frizzies, at 11. Fighting the frizzies, at 11. Frizzies, at 11.

We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world. Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell! Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman. Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison. Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season. <poem><i>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. </i></poem> Goodbye, everybody,  <poem><i>Sometimes he's runny.</i></poem> <poem><i>Sometimes he's practically water.</i></poem> <poem><i>Jews...</i></poem>  What's the matter, little guy?

Ah- Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there.  In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics.  But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by. Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park.   But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us! ...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus. Well, it's "The Millennium". ...''I'' don't know.  Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me.  Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event. How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night? Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as "the gayest party ever." Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Right. Yeah, you're supposed to know! We want to see God! God? God is going to show himself??  Is that good? I don't know. Is that good or not?!  What is it, my child? Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival. Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me. Be ye careful of pride, Jesus. I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself. Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  What did you expect me to look like, My son? Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.  My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it. You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man — with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven.  I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000.   Oh God, you're smelly! I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock. Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now.  Hullo-o-o. Oh. Pooped pants. Pooped pants. Pooped 'nmuh pants. Pooped in my pants. O-o-oh.  Oh. Uh pooped 'em.   Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one. Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty? Your father never went through puberty? Oh, I can't say that I blame him. Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones. Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me. My pleasure. I just love helping people. Mr. and Ms. McCormick. I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son. We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do. Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank. My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something. We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show. Yes?  Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it.  Oh my God.   Of course he is. This is Jesus we're talking about. He wouldn't let us down. Yeah!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! BE QUIET BACK THERE! Which way should we go?  School? What school are you from? Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York.   I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in.  You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes. Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here.  "Revised Music for Tomorrow"?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow?? Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry!   Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves. Whoa, look at this kid's coat.  I didn't know they was invitin' ''red''necks to this event! Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of ''queefs'' to me, huh?!  Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?! Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!  Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we? Of course we know what mung means! You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is ''so'' a word! Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach. You guys didn't know that?   Here they are! Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants! Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool. Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shat themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing! Yeah. See you guys later.  Yeah, huh?  We're not mung. ''You're'' mung. Yeah! Yeah, we knows all about it! Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry.  Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?! Oh, hello, son. Ub. Sure, of course.  Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'? Uh, what? Uh, okay, like what? What?? What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you! WHAT?? Oh, my God!  Well, NO!!  Uh, what's goin' on? Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't! Thuh, that's me.  What can I do for ya? Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger! No! He's upset because I ''didn't'' molest him! A ''little'', yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him. I didn't do it because it's wrong! Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year-old son?! Well, I won't have ''sex'' with him! Am I the only sane person left on earth?! Good night.  Uh huh.  Should be fine. Won't be necessary. I'm not going to molest you! God-damnit!  Well, I'm having some troubles at home. All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right? Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question? Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life?  No no wait, uh, you don't understand. Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son. Uh, he doesn't have a gun. No! Nobody's got a gun! Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again. I didn't do squat!  Please ... sing song "My Country 'Tis of Thee."  Alright people, how many people has a copy. We must have-a practiced the ... song for the performance tomorrow, please. And-a one gop seven to-sand ...  O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?! One, two, sign paytah.   Wery well?! Wery well?! You're gonna be on Ricki Lake, I tell you again! Look at ad a bah godda circada she doin wery well?! Yeah, D'ya think we wouldn't know what mung means?  It sure is.  Yeah. Uh huh.  It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow. About what? That... that can't be.  That's not true! Your father loved you! Often!  Nohoho! No! If I knew I would have made him do it! I'm not listening! He says you didn't molest him as a child! No! I didn't know!  I'm not listening! Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son? We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son. You did the right thing, Poppa.  Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad. Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas? Yeah. Absolutely. Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your ''father's'' life? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, a knife. ...Yeah, I would  Wasn't that right?  Yeah. Sure! Of course. ...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it? Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, "Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him"? Oh, that's a tough one. He could have a ''knife'', though. That's right.  Yeah, that's right. Yeah we are! Hmmm. I think if someone said, "Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son," but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it. Sure. Uh huh. Mm, See? Yeah, man. Come on, Garrison!  Wooo, yeah. No, no, no way. No. But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father. Yeup. Me, too. Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here? Well, I think that goes without saying. Mm-hm. What?? Oh, that's okay. Keep your money. Thanks.  Are we all ready to play?  Huhuh, good- good-bye.  No!  Noooo!!!   Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well.
