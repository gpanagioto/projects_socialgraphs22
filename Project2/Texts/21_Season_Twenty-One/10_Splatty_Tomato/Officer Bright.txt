Hey folks, we know you're all uh concerned, but I wanna assure you that we're doing everything we can to track the President down and have him safely removed. Since the President was given a Splatty Tomato he's become very desperate and very dangerous. If you see the President, do not approach him. Do not try to reason with him. Most importantly, remember that this is the President, so you cannot shoot him. All right? You can't even talk about shooting him. Don't even... do any coy, satirical takes on shooting him. [the room stays silent] Okay, good. What we're trying to do here is just get the President to go away. We're gonna be handing out padlocks like this one [lifts one up for display] so everyone can lock up their garbage. If we don't feed the President, hopefully he'll just move on. Are there any questions? No, no, no. It's just best to avoid that kind of talk altogether. Remember, they can do to you what they did to Kathy Griffin. That's right, so best thing is just lock up your garbage and see if we can get the President to... go away. We haven't gotten the president out of here. And there's some worse news. A bunch of kids have gone missing. I think we have to assume that the President has... eaten them. [Mrs Tweak starts crying] Don't worry, we're close. He's out in the woods somewhere. And we've set up a fox trap. We found his hideout. There. Someone's gotta go flush him out. I'll be ready to trap him. Hey, hey! Just remember he's been eating animals and living like a monster. Just... prepare yourself for what you're about to see. Hey, what the hell's going on?! It's the President! [People begin to cheer] We got him. We got the son of a bitch. [Bob White walks over and grabs Officer Bright's gun] He broke free! He'll be even more desperate now. It's going to get worse.
