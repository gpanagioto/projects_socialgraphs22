 You got it figured out yet, babe? Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.  Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.  Just give her a chance.  She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth. Yeah,  They won't let you get over yourself.   What are you doing? I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?! Butters, Heidi is everything to me.  If you take her, I swear to god... What are you talking about? Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.    I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.  Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?  That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!  Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?  Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again? Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like "Could you--Could you hand me my water," or something. I can't--I can't remember. Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again? Okay, okay, now could you just do the "my vagina" thing for them? Could you just say "my vagina"? What the fuck is happening?
