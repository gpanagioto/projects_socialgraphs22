Why? What happened? ...So? Oh, excuse me, I...    Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.  Ex-cuse me. Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?! Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted. But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her. And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA.  Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!  What's going on?  Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job. You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.
