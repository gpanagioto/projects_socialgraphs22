 Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one. Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty? Your father never went through puberty? Oh, I can't say that I blame him. Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones. Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me. My pleasure. I just love helping people.
