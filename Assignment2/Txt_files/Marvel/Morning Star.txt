==Fictional character biography==
Morning Star was the leader of a group of [[Theistic Satanism|Satanists]] known as the Followers of the Left Hand Path (presumably referring to the occult tradition of the [[Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path]]). He and his cult spent a year tracking Jack Russell, the increasingly feral [[Werewolf by Night]], the blood of whom Belial thought could be used to "reinvigorate" his followers by turning them into werewolves. In Los Angeles, the cult captured the werewolf, who escaped shortly thereafter, but not before the cult had implanted a tracking device in the creature's skull.<ref name="wbn">{{cite web  | title = Werewolf by Night  | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]  | url = http://www.marvel.com/universe/Werewolf_By_Night  | access-date = 2008-06-26}}</ref>

The [[Werewolf by Night]] fled to [[New York City]], where the superhero [[Moon Knight]] attempted to aid him.<ref name="twonine">''Moon Knight'' #29 (March 1983)</ref> They were both later captured by Morning Star and his cult, and taken to Morning Star's offices in the penthouse of New York City's [[666 Fifth Avenue|Tishman Building]], at 666 [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 40â€“41 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref>

Morning Star planned to use [[Moon Knight]] as a [[human sacrifice]], and afterwards to have his followers drink the blood of the [[Werewolf by Night]] to give them "the power of [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]]".  However, Moon Knight escaped his captors and helped the Werewolf by Night escape as well.<ref name="thirty">''Moon Knight'' #30 (April 1983)</ref>  Morning Star immediately sent his men to recapture the two, but the cultists were defeated. Moon Knight and the Werewolf by Night later infiltrated the cult, returning to Morning Star's offices, where they engaged in battle to defeat the rest of the members.  During this melee, the Werewolf by Night threw Morning Star from the roof of the 41-story Tishman Building, killing him.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Kaye  | first = Ethan  | title = Knight Fights  | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]  | date = 2008-02-14  | url = http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.2593.Knight_Fights  | access-date = 2008-06-26}}</ref>
