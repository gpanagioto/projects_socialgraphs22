HA! I killed you! Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what? Hyeah, that poor, poor thing Well, why did you pull it out of the trash? Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh? Cool! Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM. Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park. Awesome!  Oh, crap. I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun. I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake.  Thanks, Towelie. Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games. Okay, turn it on. Oh, this is so cool. Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it? Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside! She said it's fine, but that I still ''have'' to go to baseball practice tonight.. Uh no. No we don't wanna get high! Me too. Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid. What? You mean Towelie?  Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29!  Where is it? Where the hell is it?? What?  Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!! Where the hell is he? What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere. That's a towel call? Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water. There he is! Just come on! It's getting dark. Are you sure this is where they said to be? Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness! Aw, God-damnit! Are we getting close? How long has it been since you've been back there. The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is!  That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back! I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is! We're missing out on some quality video game time right now. All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere? Who's they? Okay. Dude, I figured it out. If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight! Seven and a half. That's it? Well let's look in here.  What terrifying secret? And we don't care. Go ahead.  Photon rifle, whatever.  Our GameSphere!  Sweet!   I've almost got it! I got it!  Awesome! Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
