 Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery. So you're going to have a ''substitute'' teacher. And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison. Yes, little boy? ...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen. Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay. That's right. Will you stay? Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died. Oh, my! What an exciting day! And just what is going on here, mister? Ms. Ellen, is this true? Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. ''Take her away!''
