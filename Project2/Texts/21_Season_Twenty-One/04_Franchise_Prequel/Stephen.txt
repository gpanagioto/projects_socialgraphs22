 Butters, you're not looking at boobies again, are you? You know what I think the problem is? Facebook. Well, look, we all know there's a lot of mixing of truth and fiction that's been on Facebook lately, and children lack the cognitive ability to determine what's true and what isn't on Facebook. That's why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes, eating poop, and having sex with antelopes in our town. Why not give it a try? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg here and see what he has to say? I'm sure he's a reasonable person.  What, eh. Excuse me, this is our car?! Get, get out of here, ya penis. You have to do something! This guy's goin' around acting like everyone's stuff is his! Please, you don't understand! He-h he's such a penis! Butters! You're the one who started all this?! You think you're just so smart, don't you?! Make me look like a fool, will you?! We'll just see about this! Not so funny now, is it?! Go on! Tell Mr. Putin what you told me! Didn't break any rules?! Good job teaching our children that's all that matters! Just because there's a way to cause chaos in a town, or disrupt an entire country, doesn't mean you go and do it, does it?! If Mark Zuckerberg points a loaded cannon at someone's face,  are you innocent for just lighting the fuse?! Answer me! No! You don't go around making things up about people either! Unless it's about Mark Zuckerberg, because he deserves it!
