What do you want? Yeah, 'cause you were gonna snap her bra. Fuck you. Are you done now? Can I hang up?  Hello? Mom! Dad! Goddamit, Cartman! Here!  No, I'm Jewish.  I'm just here because some fat intolerant asshole didn't want me around! What about all the other kids? When do they get to go home? My people? Aren't you worried about what you're creating here?! You're pulling children away from their parents and isolating them behind bars. You're traumatizing them and teaching them to fear the U.S. government. Okay, let me try to put this in terms you people will understand. You know superhero movies, right? Okay. You remember how they always create the villain? Some random person who, when they were a child, got taken from their parents and locked away? And the kid was just left to sit and plot revenge? What you're doing here is creating a Mexican Joker!  fight back with a passion unlike anything you've ever seen! No, it could be any of them! That's the point! You don't know which kid in there is gonna snap from being separated and locked down like this! Mexican Joker doesn't care! When that kid grows up, all that will matter is getting back at all of you! What the fuck are you doing here?! I haven't seen my parents in *two weeks*! Nobody even knows where my little brother is! Wait. I have an idea how to get everyone out of here. Get everyone's aluminum foil and some scissors. Just do it before I kill you! Shema Israel Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai ehad.  Goddamnit, nobody here is Mexican Joker! That's not what I meant! The future is not set! We make decisions now that affect our future! NO!!
