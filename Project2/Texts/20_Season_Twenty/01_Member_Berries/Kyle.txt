I think they called it German Collective Guilt, right? Where even the Germans who just did nothing while Hitler rose to power were, were maybe somehow also responsible? But I can't control what Cartman does, so, so why should I feel ashamed for what Cartman does? I don't think the answer to all this is member berries. Agh, never mind. I'm just gonna stay out of it.  What the hell are you doing?! You really think you're fooling anyone with this fake persona?! Everyone knows you're acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the Internet at night! I don't really care! Just don't drag me into it!  Goddammit!  Do you guys even care how this makes the girls feel?! We all know who did! And if we don't do something, then the girls will eventually retaliate against us!  I didn't know vagina had balls. You're just trying to start a war, aren't you?! It's not gonna work, Cartman! I'm not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore! when this whole thing comes to an end, you're gonna be all on your own!  Yeah? What are you doing here?? I'm going to the bathroom!  They sat it out because you were harassing them online. Why would you care?! If we could just prove who the troll was, then the girls wouldn't be wanting a war, would they?! Just know this, Cartman! I'm going to prove who Skankhunt42 is, whatever it takes! Everyone is going to know! And Skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's! ever! said! Yeah Dad. Just thinkin'.
