 Aw, come on. What's wrong with two guys liking each other? But if love is love, then it takes form in all shapes and sizes. Teehee. Really? Can I? Oh thank you! I won't!  You just need a little spark of magic.  I hit him with my love arrow, and then I peed in his mouth just for fun. I thought you might like that. And do you think I'm cute, too? 'Cause I think you're kind of cute. Oh, well, at least Tweek and Craig are in love now.  Teeheehee. Aw, come on, let's be like Tweek and Craig. Everyone thinks they're kewl. But I'm so attracted to you. I'm just here to pick up on guys. Why? are you jealous? Oh, now you need me, huh? Fuck you, dude. Well, I guess I could try now, in return for just... one date? Then I guess I'm not interested. Teeheehee! Teeheeheeheehee! You just need a little prick of magic.  Teeheeheehee, teeheeheehee.   Teeheehee. Aren't you liking your massage? Well, I've got something you might like a little better.  Teeheeheehee!
