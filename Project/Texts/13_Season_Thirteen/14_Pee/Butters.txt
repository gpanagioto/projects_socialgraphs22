What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.  Okay, thanks.  You said "go ahead". Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do. You bet! The who? Whoopie!  Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again! Come on, Kyle! Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands ''before'' you touch your weiner!  Do you need to wash your hands? You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle. Well yeah, seeing all that running water always makes me ''need'' to pee. Please, Kyle, I wanna go home. You can do it, Kyle!  Hawww, you lived? What's this?
