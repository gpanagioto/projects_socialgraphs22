'''Detroit Steel''' is a fictional suit of [[powered armor]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], in which it is usually operated by adversaries or rivals of [[Iron Man]]. Created by writer [[Matt Fraction]] and artist [[Salvador Larocca]], Detroit Steel first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' (vol 5) #25 (June 2010) as part of the "Stark Resilient" storyline. 

==Publication history==
Detroit Steel first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'' (vol 5) #25 (June 2010), the first part of the nine-part "Stark Resilient" storyline, which depicted [[Tony Stark]]'s struggle to build his new company Stark Resilient,<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=109}}</ref> whose signature product is a car powered by the same clean repulsor technology that powers his Iron Man armor.<ref name=IronMan25>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Stark Resilient Part 1: Hammer Girls|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=25|date=June 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref><ref name=MarvelSneakPeak>Mahadeo, Kevin. [http://marvel.com/news/story/11856/sneak_peek_detroit_steel "SNEAK PEEK: Detroit Steel"]. Marvel Comics. April 1, 2010</ref>

Writer [[Matt Fraction]] created Detroit Steel to embody jingoistic patriotism in the vein of ''[[Team America: World Police|Team America]]'',<ref name=MarvelSneakPeak/> and describes the character thus:

<blockquote>He is what follows in the hole left behind by Iron Man once Tony Stark leaves the world stage. Tony hasn't been around to protect the regular interests that he might have during his time running Stark Industries or running S.H.I.E.L.D. And now that he's back, he's made it clear he doesn't want to get back into the geo-political side of things necessarily. Detroit Steel is what happens in that absence. He is a sort of Blackwater-meets-[[NASCAR]] corporate-sponsored armored enhanced guy available for hire to the highest bidder for whatever cause around the round. Basically, Iron Man's worst nightmare of what he could become. An absolute perversion of everything he is.<ref name=MarvelSneakPeak/></blockquote>

Though the Detroit Steel armor exhibits the [[American flag]]'s colors, Fraction states that the Detroit Steel armor can repainted to reflect the colors of whatever country or corporation purchases them, from the [[Flag of Japan|Japanese]] [[Rising Sun Flag]]<ref name=MarvelSneakPeak/> (which makes an appearance in ''The Invincible Iron Man'' #27<ref name=IronMan27>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Stark Resilient Part 3: This Is What We Do|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=27|date=August 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>) to the yellow and red colors of [[McDonald's]]. Fraction also contrasts Detroit Steel with Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor#Bleeding Edge Armor|Bleeding Edge armor]], which debuted in the same issue, by describing the latter as "sleeker, slicker and pared down", whereas the former is "bigger and better and boisterous and loud and noisy and everything else. It's like the difference between a Porsche and a Mack Truck".<ref name=MarvelSneakPeak/>

==Fictional history==
Former [[United States Air Force]] Lieutenant '''Doug Johnson III''' is the first pilot of the Detroit Steel armor, first appearing during the "Stark Resilient" storyline. He underwent surgical modifications in order to operate the weaponized suit, and also trained the other pilots in the Steelcorps army. Hammer Industries, led by [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]] and [[Sasha Hammer]], not only wish revenge on Tony Stark for their patriarch [[Justin Hammer]]'s death, but see Stark as an obstacle for their product Detroit Steel which they hope to market globally as a new soldier for the world.<ref name=IronMan25/><ref name="IronManV5#31">{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Stark Resilient Part 7: Sabot|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=31|date=December 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Justine and Sasha embark on a campaign to discredit [[Iron Man]] in the industrial market, conspiring with the corrupt Pentagon General Babbage, and staging civilian attacks in which Detroit Steel is arranged to intervene before Iron Man.<ref name="IronManVol5starres">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fraction, Matt]]|artist=[[Larocca, Salvador]]|title=[[The Invincible Iron Man (comics)|The Invincible Iron Man]]|story=Stark Resilient|volume=1|issue=25-32|date=June 2010-January 2011|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Shortly after, Detroit Steel launches a surprise attack on Stark Resilient by orchestrating a remote-server air-strike unwittingly piloted by young gamers on their mobile devices who are unaware these actions were actually taking place in the real world. The combined efforts of Iron Man, [[War Machine]], [[Pepper Potts|Rescue]] and [[Maria Hill]] are able to stop the strike and shut down Detroit Steel.<ref name="IronManVol5starres"/>

===Steelcorps===
The '''Detroit Steelcorps'''<ref name=IronMan512/> (otherwise known as the '''Steelmechs''',<ref name=IronMan506>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]] Part 3: The Apostate|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=506|date=September 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and '''Hammermechs'''<ref name=IronMan507>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Fear Itself Part 4: Fog of War|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=507|date=October 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>) is a line of armored soldiers marketed by Hammer Industries. 

During the "Stark Resilient" storyline, a fleet of unmanned flying drones aided in Detroit Steel's attack against Iron Man. Anonymous [[gamer]]s were duped into believing that the missions carrying out on Hammer Industries' behalf were a playable video game via a cell phone [[Application software|application]], in which they pretended to be Detroit Steel's "[[Wingman (social)|wingman]]".<ref name=IronManV5#29-33>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Stark Resilient|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=29-33|date=October 2010-February 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref><ref>Tabu, Hannibal.

A team of Steelmechs are subsequently led by Sasha into Paris, ostensibly on behalf of the U.S. and French governments, where they battle Rescue before being confronted by Mokk: Breaker of Faith.<ref name=IronMan507/>

The Steelcorps also appear in the subsequent "Long Way Down" storyline.<ref name=IronMan#516/>

According to Hammer Industries, Detroit Steel represents "the most bleeding-edge research into man/machine spinal hybrid mechanics the world has ever seen", and incorporates technology, such as C.N.S. (Controlled Exo-Enhanciles), that would eventually be used to end paralysis caused by [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]], [[thoracic]] or [[corticospinal]] [[Spinal cord injury|injuries]].

The Detroit Steel suit allows its users to fly, and usually is seen with a [[rotary cannon]] mounted on its right arm, and a specialized chainsaw on its left,<ref name=IronMan25/> which can penetrate Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor#Bleeding Edge Armor|Bleeding Edge Armor]].<ref name=IronManV5#32/> There are rocket-powered munitions on the suit's shoulders.<ref name=IronMan25/> The rotary cannon can be dismounted so that the soldier can carry and fire it as a traditional handheld weapon,<ref name=IronMan508>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Fear Itself Part 5: If I Ever Get Out Of Here|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=508|date=November 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and the Detroit Steel armor's users have been seen outfitted with other types of weapons in this manner, including both [[directed-energy weapon]]s and scaled-up rifles.<ref name="IronMan507"/> Sasha Hammer's Detroit Steel armor has also been depicted with a directed-energy weapon in palm of its hands.<ref name=IronMan508/> Those who pilot the Detroit Steel armor are required to undergo considerable surgical modifications, which leave implants visible on the pilot's chest, which Doug Johnson felt "turned him into a monster". According to Justine Hammer, the company designed models for different environments and [[Hot zone (environment)|hot zone]]s, including arctic climates and urban encounters.<ref name=IronMan25/> Suits of different heights and designs have also been depicted.<ref name=IronMan511/><ref name=IronMan#516/>

==Reception==
Alex Evans, reviewing ''Invincible Iron Man'' #33 for [[Weekly Comic Book Review]], while praising the "Stark Resilient" storyline (which he gave a [[Grade (education)#United States|B-]]), found [[Justine Hammer]] and [[Sasha Hammer]] to be more effective villains than Detroit Steel, which he found to be "bland" and "boring". Evans also disliked the lack of a resolution to Detroit Steel and Iron Man's battle in ''Invincible Iron Man'' #33,<ref name=WeeklyCBReview2>Evans, Alex. [http://weeklycomicbookreview.com/2010/12/24/invincible-iron-man-33-review/ "Invincible Iron Man #33 – Review"]. Weekly Comic Book Review. December 24, 2010</ref> though he later praised ''Iron Man'' #505, which he felt tied up that loose end.<ref name=WeeklyCBReview1/> Evans was more receptive to the character's use in the subsequent storyline "The Long Way Down", saying of ''Invincible Iron Man'' #518, "The manner in which Fraction and Larroca depict the fight between Detroit Steel and Sasha Hammer was brilliant, alternating panels between the fight itself (at night) and the aftermath (the broken apartment in the daylight).  It created almost a police procedural, detective feel that also served to make the whole thing a bit haunting and unsettling, which is great given how creepy 'Detroit Steel' already is".<ref>Evans, Alex.
