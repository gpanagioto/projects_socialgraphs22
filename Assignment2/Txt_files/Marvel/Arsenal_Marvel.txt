'''Arsenal''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #114 (Sept. 1978) and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Keith Giffen]].

==Publication history==
Arsenal first appeared in a two-part storyline in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #114 (Sept. 1978) and ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers Annual]]'' #9 (1979). The character made a final appearance in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #282 (April 1983). The Arsenal "Alpha" unit appeared in ''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #84-85 (Aug. 2004).

==Fictional character biography==
In the final days of [[World War II]], a group of Allied scientists led by [[Howard Stark]] developed "Project Tomorrow" and the creation of a [[robot]] called Arsenal, a [[prototype]] fighting unit to be deployed in the event of an [[Axis powers|Axis]] victory. The robot was also guided by Howard's early computer program called Mistress. When the Allies won the war, Arsenal was placed in storage. The robot was activated for a military demonstration during a worsening [[Cold War]] but was never used. In the present day, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are battling the [[Unicorn (Marvel Comics)|Unicorn]] underneath [[Avengers Mansion]], when Arsenal suddenly appears and attacks the group. However, [[Iron Man]] successfully drives Arsenal off.<ref>''Iron Man'' #114 (Sept. 1978). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Avengers learn the robot's origin from the group's government liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. Arsenal reappears and captures [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and stuns [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] with an electric shock. Yellowjacket, however, recovers and alerts the other Avengers, advising the group that Project Tomorrow is directly beneath the mansion.

Guided by Mistress erroneously believing the Allies lost World War II, Arsenal defeats several Avengers, until confronted by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Scarlet Witch]]. On the verge of defeat, Arsenal apparently self-destructs while Iron Man confronts Mistress programmed with [[Maria Stark]]'s brain patterns. Once Iron Man unmasks and explains that the Allies won the war, and that Mistress is simply modeled after Maria, the computer program wipes its own memory.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #9 (1979). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Arsenal actually faked its own destruction. When [[She-Hulk]] and the [[Hulk]] visit Avengers mansion, it attacks the Avengers' butler [[Edwin Jarvis]]. Arsenal then incapacitates She-Hulk, and the enraged Hulk pummels Arsenal until it is destroyed.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #282 (April 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Iron Man eventually learns that only a "Beta" unit had been destroyed, and that an "Alpha" unit remained deactivated beneath Avengers Mansion. [[Homeland Security]] ask him to shut it down without informing the other Avengers due to the security risk it poses. Iron Man tracks the unit, but is unaware that the Avengers have followed. The unit is activated when transmission codes are radioed to Iron Man, which results in a battle between the new Arsenal and the Avengers. Iron Man then realises that Arsenal was activated by interference with its signal, which was set to "inert". Iron Man occupies Arsenal while [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]] stops the source of the interference, causing Arsenal to deactivate. The unit is then dismantled.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #84-85 (2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fully reassembled and under control, Arsenal is later used as a test for a group of Avengers recruits, under the pretext that it is out of control.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #2 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Iron Man 2020 (event)|Iron Man 2020]]" event, [[Arno Stark]] recreates the eScape variation of Arsenal as well as a robot version of eScape's Mistress to serve as new bodies for his copies of Howard and Maria.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both Arsenal units possess amplified strength and durability. The Beta unit also possesses air jets and inertia darts; can radiate an electro-stun field and project a high-intensity laser beam from its eyes. The Alpha unit possesses a flame-thrower, multiple gun systems and a toxic gas dispenser.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] equivalent of Arsenal is '''[[Howard Stark Sr.]]''' after having used "Project Tomorrow" to turn himself into a human/machine hybrid capable of leading additional Arsenal units.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Noir===
In ''[[Marvel Noir|Iron Man Noir]]'', the Arsenal robots were created as a Nazi weapon by [[Baron Zemo#Marvel Noir|Baron Zemo]].<ref>''Iron Man Noir'' #3 (August 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
A variation of Arsenal appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'', voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Arsenal|series-link=Avengers Assemble (TV series)|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=1|airdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> This version is a robot designed by [[Howard Stark]] to safely absorb and maintain massive amounts of energy. Introduced in its self-titled episode, Arsenal is discovered by [[Iron Man]] in an abandoned Russian city where its body was used to contain a reactor's gamma radiation for decades until the [[Hulk]] uses the Power Stone to reactivate it. In "Thanos Rising", Arsenal serves as Iron Man's friend and protector while helping him and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] fight the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]. When the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] fight [[Thanos]], Arsenal sacrifices itself by self-destructing to send Thanos away from Earth. After recovering its head, the Avengers gradually rebuild and modify Arsenal over the course of "Ghosts of the Past" and "Back to the Learning Hall". In "Thanos Triumphant", Arsenal uses its new form to absorb the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]]' energies and help the Avengers defeat Thanos once more. However, [[Ultron]]'s AI takes over Arsenal to absorb the Infinity Stones, reshape Arsenal's body to resemble his own, and become more powerful. After making minor appearances in "Crack in the System" and "Avengers Disassembled", Arsenal returns in "The Ultron Outbreak" wherein it briefly gains control of Ultron's host body to say goodbye to Iron Man before sacrificing itself again to defeat Ultron.
