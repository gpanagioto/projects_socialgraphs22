Now headlining the event is Timmy , the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that ''was'' going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins.  Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should ''not'' be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news.
