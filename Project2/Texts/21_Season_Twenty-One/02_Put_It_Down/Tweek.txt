We're all gonna die! They have nuclear missiles! Wuh! Waaaa! Why are you just sitting there, doing nothing?!  AAAH!  AAAH! I can't settle down! We're all gonna die!  Oh God! The President tweeted that North Korea doesn't have the guts to attack us! Why would he say that?! He's making everything worse! But North Koreans are gonna think we all agree with the President! ...That won't help anything! North Korea wants us dead! I can't write in Korean and they all think we're war-hungry anyway! Errrrg!

How am I supposed to calm down?! North Korea is gonna get me! They're gonna get me! But Craig, I- Ugh! What are we doing here, Craig?!  The Ferris wheel!!  Oh God! Another tweet from the President! "Why would the U.S. be scared of North Korea? Tweek is so not scared he's at an amusement park in Denver right now."  JESUS CHRIST, WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!!  Oh my God, what is that? What is that?! Will you please stop saying that?! I can't take it! Well, maybe I don't wanna feel better right now! Why do you have to be so logical?! I don't need you to problem-solve all the time, I need you to... Augh, I don't know! You haven't been dealing with it, you've been trying to make it go away because my emotions are freaking you out!  There you go again! Stop preaching facts to me! It's not what I need! What? What do you mean, what's going on?! The same shit that's been going on! I feel scared! I feel alone! It is!  It's terrible! Like, like I have no control over my life. Like I'm just a pawn in a big game. Yeah, like trapped, but like, completely unable to even move. I don't know, it's... it's like... maybe, maybe I have to find a way to feel a little in charge of me again. I don't know, but I I've gotta do something about this. There's gotta be a way I can...  I've got it. People aren't focused on the right thing. I know what I should do.
