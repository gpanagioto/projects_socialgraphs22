 That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried. Uh, there has to be something. Damn it!  These things are impossible to get rid of.  Nothing kills these things! They're not in the jar?  That's it. Look, it's over.  Even if we've found a way to eradicate them now, we don't have time to implement it nation-wide.  You're gonna have to talk to them.  you're gonna have to speak from the heart: not make it about you. You know what these things are capable of. Even if you lose the election, another one like you is gonna rise up and take your place. J.J. Abrams is seeing to that. All I know is that for the future of our country, you're gonna have to give one last speech: the speech that everyone needs to hear, a speech where you finally just talk like a normal human being.
