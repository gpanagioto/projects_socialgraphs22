Okay, hang on a second I- All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you? Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?! Oh, no! No! Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. Yeah. Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool. Totally, dude, let's play Fireman. Shut up, fat ass! Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool!  Do you know how to start a fire? We're firemen! Code 7! Bring in the firemen!  We saved the school! My mom is gonna break my legs! Not us. We're good kids. Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us! We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident! Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it. That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years! Dude, we shouldn't be here! We need you to protect us... from a bully. Well...  Well, what do you want? Wait! We'll do it. Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes? What else has big round squishy globes?   Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.  God, I hope this works.  Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?  Naw. Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up! Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!  We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible! From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders. So you're gonna help us? The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids. Our lives have ''not'' been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you!  Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be ''really'' mad!
