Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again? Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't- What the hell happened to him? I'm gonna be Jesus! Oh, and like you're gonna do it, ''Jew''?! Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home!  Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves.   Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't. This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home.  Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.  This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak. Peter! Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess. Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me. Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.   Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys. Up your ass with broken glass! Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!  Well, get me down from here! What?! Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  God!  Hey, there you guys are! You guys are in ''big'' trouble! Now get me down from here! You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down! ...Really?  Dude, superpowers are sweet.  You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here! Officer Barbrady!  Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here. You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down. Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.  Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now. You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this! Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stan and Kyle" song?! Ahem.  Chef! Chef! Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me! Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys! What? What?!  Oh, damnit! Hello-o.  Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now. Get me down from here! Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
