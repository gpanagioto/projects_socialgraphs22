 Be careful with my baby.  You're going to be okay, baby. Is he going to be okay? Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?  Why?? What's wrong with him?? Well, what does he need? What can we do?  It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time. He's looking a little better today. Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there. Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out! It's too far and your parents want you back home. Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon. Please, call me Liane. Oh dear. Get it down. Oh, baby, your time is back! Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie. I thought ''you'' got it.
